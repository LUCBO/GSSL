b"reflection on bosnia lord owen and the serb in early february '93 lord owen make appearance in new york city on the donahue and charlie rise show on a couple of occasion on those show lord owen give away his pro-serbian position when he make the point that much or most of the bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by serbian force have be control and occupy by serb before wwii it be a if he be say that since the serb have previously occupy those territory and lose them during the hitler year they should be allow to reconquer them today i be familiar with this view because my father a yugoslav jew who escape to this country during the war be aid and found sympathy among the serb during those harrow year in recent month when the subject of serbian aggression be mention my father would make the point that 850,000 serb be kill by nazi and pro-nazi croatian force know a the ustasha my father be so pro-serbian that he dismiss report of serbian atrocity my father also excoriate new york time columnist anthony lewis because my father say anthony lewis `` be always talk about the muslim '' update -- april 28 1993 after an uneasy truce in and around sbernica shell have resume in nearby area by all side and the kill and the misery continue apace while the clinton administration dither it response in the day lead to the collapse of resistance at sbernica lord owen change his tune previously he have oppose military intervention on the ground that it would endanger u.n. relief worker when serbian force begin to march on sbernica the threat to u.n. relief soldier go unmentioned while lord owen call for outside intervention to stop serbian aggression include the use of air strike the current disastrous situation can be see a a failure of the west and a failure of the vance-owen initiative which do nothing to halt the serb now that it 's too late to save muslim area that lord owen felt should be in a muslim state lord owen belatedly call for strong action clinton and bosnia in the summer of 1992 george kenney a senior state department official the undersecretary in charge of the yugoslav desk make news when he resign from the state department because of the bush administration 's refusal to take any action to halt serbian aggression a kenney saw it bush 's inaction be largely due to the president 's unwillingness to risk any political capital by get involve there apparently the same be true of the clinton administration clinton give the impression that he care more than bush do about the terrible ongoing tragedy but the practical effect have so far be the same accord to the new york time 4/16/93 the clinton administration do everything it could to suppress a mid-march report by it own expert which call for military action if necessary to protect `` safe haven '' for the muslim at one point senate majority leader george mitchell be so incense that the report be kept from congress that he call for an investigation instead of help the desperate bosnians clinton have signal again and again that milosevic and the serb be free to do what they want in bosnia -- indeed clinton and the west have be signal that the serb should get on with the job and finish off the bosnians a quickly a possible while we turn the other way a key signal be when clinton make it clear that he would not send in american military force on the ground on this issue clinton have make me wistful for bush bush and baker could not have do bad and might have be pressure to do well well before this time life in bosnia might have be save and the destruction might have be curtailed.. the nation the left and `` the bosnian quandary '' typical of the left 's inability to come to grip with the core issue involve in bosnia i.e. a clear aggressor destroy hundred of thousand of life be the editorial on the `` bosnian quandary '' in the nation 4/26/93 in the end the editorial vote to do nothing even while notice `` the ghastly atrocity of the bosnian serb '' and that the `` great and lesser power ... dither and fuss and hang back '' `` before anything else happens the clinton administration ought to pay the 530 million the united state owes the '' u.n. the editorial concludes in it most strike passage the editorial writer warns that '' those who be push president clinton to intervene on the side of the bosnians have well review u.s. foreign policy since world war ii '' the editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the bosnian serb be no bad than any number of u.s. client include the chilean the south african the greek fascist and others in a subsequent column for the nation christopher hitchens correctly call this editorial `` contemptible '' *** william pfaff a european base journalist who writes for the the new yorker and the los angeles time be among a group of liberal columnist like anthony lewis and leslie gelb who have clearly and consistently call for strong western and american intervention to stop the serb pfaff 's most recent column liberal opinion week 4/19/93 be entitle `` international cowardice worsen bosnian tragedy '' he clarifies the international failure which have lead to present situation in one sentence `` have refuse to intervene to sanction the threat to minority right in newly independent croatia in june 1991 or to block or penalize the military aggression by serbia that immediately follow and the atrocious '' ethnic cleanse '' which follow that the united nation now contemplates deploy in bosnia military force on a scale which two year ago could have deter the horror yugoslavia have since experienced '' he go on to explain that u.n. plan now envisage call for a `` more daunt and open-ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have be a year ago '' aryeh neier on the serb in his `` watch right '' column in the the nation 5/3/93 aryeh neier get to the heart of the motivation of the `` aggressor '' -- the prefer term for the serbian force who have be besieging and shell sarajevo for more than a year he explains that `` there be no military purpose that be serve by the destruction of it fabric and it people ... above all few of those align with the force attack sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt they be not city people `` it be this i believe -- aside from a desire to break the morale of bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price -- that explains the conduct of the siege of sarajevo ... i t be a loathe for all that be urban pluralist and cosmopolitan that have make sarajevo the object for devastation `` historically most of the serbian population in bosnia and herzegovina have be rural while muslim who be the civil servant and intelligentsia during the century of ottoman rule make up a disproportionate share of the urban population ... .the destruction of sarajevo be not only an expression of hostility against this city it be also an attack on the urban idea ... .the demagogue who whip up the passion let loose by this war exploit not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that be cosmopolitan '' the light that neier shed on the issue help to clarify what be at stake the serb represent the know-nothing anti-secularist fundamentalist fascist force who be attack the urban cosmopolitan secular multi-cultural idea they be attack the rest of u just a hitler do one irony be that at the begin of the crisis over bosnia it be for awhile maintain by the serb and their supporter that they be respond to a threat by the bosnian muslim to create a fundamentalist state neier have show that it be the serb who be the great threat to secularism multi-culturalism diversity and democracy it 's the serb who be attack the democratic notion the democratic idea anthony lewis come close to the point when he asks why do respect for clinton 's presidency `` depend ... on his act effectively against serbian aggression ... first of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the value we and our ally profess '' time 4/26/93 but it 's not merely a betrayal of our value it 's because the serb be attack u by proxy just a hitler be one argument for decisive action by the west that be heard in a different form be that war in the balkan be destablizing for europe we hear it a the bosnians be europe 's palestinian that be to say just a the palestinian refugee problem have be the key to instability in the middle east just so will the hundred of thousand of yugoslav refugee of all ethnicity result in turmoil in europe for decade to come one of the lesson of the twentieth century be that even though the atlantic ocean divide u the america be ultimately tie to the destiny of europe if europe be destabilize the u.s. will inevitably be affected and drawn into it problem a in a whirlpool sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom and a past history and pfaff have show it 's much well if we do so decisively quickly and on our term"

b"from center for policy research cpr subject labour 's enclave policy.important labour 's enclave policy in the occupy territory by israel shahak publ in middle east international london 30.4.93 it be not difficult to discover israel 's policy towards the palestinian at any give time it can be easily infer from the fact on the ground and from the information provide by the hebrew press there be one condition though the torrent of claptrap about `` the peace process '' must be totally ignore a must israel 's official pronouncement whole sole purpose be to distort reality by concentrate only on the fact it be early apparent that labour 's policy be no different from those of shamir but for their great reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation likud 's policy be accurately described by ariel sharon in an article accompany by a map in yediot aharonot last august the sharon plan envisage a division of the west bank into seven and the gaza strip into four `` autonomous '' palestinian enclave all of them under israeli supervision the total area of these enclave amount to about 15 per cent of the territory the rest be to be control by the israeli settlement and the highway built around the enclave the entire area around jerusalem from the outskirt of ramallah to the boundary of bethlehem have already be turn into a `` great jerusalem '' where the arab- inhabit locality amount to small enclave surround by area occupy by israeli settlement or reserve for them judging from labour 's settlement policy it may be assume that it may content itself with a lesser number of arab enclave of a rather large size than sharon have plan but the principle of surround the enclave by settlement strategically disperse along the highway remains unchanged labour plan only four enclave in the west bank two in `` samaria '' and two in `` judea '' i.e north and south of jerusalem respectively and no more than two in the gaza strip in regard to `` great jerusalem '' labour 's policy hardly deviate from sharon 's a saner version of likud policy a some israeli correspondent at once realise labour policy be but a saner version of sharon 's extravaganza last july gideon eshet write in yediot aharonot that while `` barely a few month ago '' labour support the demand to freeze all construction beyond the green line `` no specific decision to freeze construction in the territory have be take '' and uzi benziman write in ha'aretz that `` a far a can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussion in jerusalem rabin intend to stick to likud 's way '' the two big enclave envisage by labour be locate in `` samaria '' therefore the belt of settlement around the `` trans-samaria highway '' design to separate those enclave from each other be of paramount importance accord to the late data the percentage of israeli settler in the entire west bank population apart from east jerusalem be a mere 5.5 per cent but for the area around the `` trans-samaria highway '' the correspond figure be almost 20 per cent and it be increase steadily the situation in the settlement of the `` efrat block '' south of jerusalem design to sever the enclave around bethlehem from the one around hebron be pretty much the same the `` efrat block '' be now be connect with west jerusalem by a highway the project be costly in the extreme because the highway be design to bypass bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnel the final decision to build this highway be suspend until rabin 's return from his u visit in march the subsequent decision to renew it construction can be see a u approval for the enclave plan a a whole process of impoverishment the enclave plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the palestinian this be well know in israel but ignore abroad by all who should be concerned include the plo in regard to the gaza strip the whole process be best described by ze'ev shiff in ha'aretz in march he mention have see `` a pamphlet issue six year ago by the civil administration forecasting the condition in the gaza strip under israeli rule in 2000 '' his analysis deserves to be quote extensively '' we continue to steal the strip 's water even though it quality deteriorates from year to year we continue to steal the strip 's tiny land resource in order to found there more and more settlement a if we deliberately want to make the inhabitant despair and in their despair think in termws of have nothing to lose it be by our own do that the strip 's worker must now spend travel to their workplace almost a much time a they spend work from the military point of view we have kept control of no more than half the strip 's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resource about a year before moshe arens left the defence ministry i heard him say that we should withdraw from the strip come what may his argument be that israel sink into the strip ever deeper and deeper he told me he have propose this to yitzhak shamir but he reject it '' yitzhak rabin reject it too enormous state support for the qatif block settler can also be cite a proof that the enclave plan be be implement the qatif block settlement found by the first rabin government of 1974-77 be intend to divide the gaza strip into two separate enclave efraim davidi of davar have data show how vital for israeli this enterprise be `` the qatif block be now produce 40 per cent of israeli tomato destine for export and a substantial proportion of cut flower '' he also deal with the subsidy the settler receive considerably augment by the present government owe to them housing unit be cheap the present government do not spare effort to recruit new settler to the block `` any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekel 6,500 '' such data show that israel 's plan apply whether the palestinian of the gaza strip be allow or forbidden to work in israel the economic motivation be explain by danny rubinstein in ha'aretz in march '' from the economic viewpoint gaza could already be seal off hermetically and all the strip 's worker could be bar from enter israel ... even though accurate data be hard to come by it be indisputable that during the last two year the numbes of gazan worker arrive daily to work in israel have markedly decrease from 80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today but the decrease be not only due to restriction impose on enter israel from gaza it be also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for gazan labour in israel with unemployment in israel soar and the construction of apartment block virtually halt the worker from gaza be no longer really need ... '' gaza 's total dependence the entire economy of the gaza strip be totally dependent on israel in recent year in the gaza strip there have be an increase in sub-contracted work for israeli factory mostly footware and textile thousand of small workshop employ an average of four worker get their raw material or unfinished product together with detailed work instruction from israeli factory rubinstein attribute this development to the fact that '' the average wage in the gaza strip be merely 40 per cent of that in the west bank which in turn stand at half the average wage in israel and besides the gazan employer do not pay any social security for his employee '' if the average wage in the gaza strip be just a fifth of that in israel the profit of israeli factory and even of palestinian sub-contractors must be vast they be high still when `` a gazan sub-contractor provide labour to be perform at home with the family 's help the livelihood of ten of thousand of gazans depends on such sub-contracted work '' many of them be woman and child paid about ten shekel 3.50 a day which can last 12 hour or more there can be no doubt that profit from exploit cheap gazan labour be one of the reason for the stubborn opposition of rabin and other israeli minister to withdrawal from the strip economic condition in the gaza strip differ little from what be create straight after israel 's conquest in 1967 in this respect one should not be delude by the talk nowadays fashionable about israeli gesture intend to `` encourage economic development in the territory '' a israeli journalist point out all permit for opening new business depend on a prior approval by the shin bet `` behind all the profess goodwill there be no desire to solve problem just the attitude of a good colonialist willing to do something for the benefit of the native but on condition that they behave nicely do not become rebellious and never do anything against the interest of the metropolis it economic interest include '' write michal sela in davar in february the development of sub-contracted work in the gaza strip accord perfectly with sela 's diagnosis sela also show how exactly the economic control work `` in all branch of the economy lobby have be set in motion for purpose of free israeli production from the threat of any palestinian competition the method be simplicity itself a soon a any israeli producer succeed in persuade the government or even the trade and industry minister alone a military order be issue prohibit the export of a give produce to israel if this do not suffice a palestinian factory may be deny a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacle may paralyse it production '' among the most active of such lobby be the agricultural one it have succeed in limit export of gazan vegetable except for those grown by settler not only to israel but also to europe where they otherwise might compete with israeli export perpetuaring apartheid labour 's goal be to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territory the same goal be share by the u which otherwise could not support the labour government so firmly in my view one of the reason the u feel happier about support labour than likud be it great efficiency in pursue the settlement drive this point be brought home by ofer shelah in ma'ariv who deplore the settler failure which he attribute to likud 's inefficiency he show that the peak yearly settlement growth `` occur during the term of office of the national unity government i.e 1984-90 in which rabin serve throughout a the defence minister '' likud 's reputation for settle the territory well than labour be false attributable to the many tiny settlement without strategic value found under shamir for symbolic reason to sum up labour 's policy unconditionally support by the u differs from that of likud primarily in the efficiency with which it be implement accord to that policy the territory be to be divide into two part the major part be to be rule by israel directly and the minor part indirectly in my view this racist scheme be doom to ultimately fail but at a horrify price in human suffer the sooner it true nature be recognise the less suffer it may cause"

i become terrify i take the child and go out in the entryway and go down a few stair i go down and heard a loudspeaker it be in the courtyard `` the armenian must be kill they 've take all the best place all the best apartment '' one of them say `` let the armenian blood flow none of them should survive '' when i heard that i go upstairs and start knock on door no one open their door for me not on the third floor or the fourth i could n't see zhasmen any longer ira come upstairs later i even thought that they have let her stay that they would save her my head be spin they be kill my family and here i be in the next entryway with two child seryozha be four and kristina be five and a half they be cry `` mamma we 're scar '' they be so frighten that i do n't even know how to calm them should i try to calm them or myself it be awful but on the third floor a man do open his door i ask `` open up let me inside '' he open the door slightly and say `` no '' `` no '' and that be it he say it so sternly `` no '' i go up to the fifth floor i pound my fist on the door with all my might he open up the man of the house and stood there look at me i be ready to get down on my knee i almost do get down on my knee `` please i beg of you at least take the child '' he be n't an azerbaijani he be a lezgin i do n't even know how but he let me inside and when i go in zhasmen be already there two minute have n't pass when ira and lilia come up the stair lilia be cry he do n't want to open the door and again i start plead `` please open the door it 's our ira and lilia open the door '' and he say `` no i 'm afraid '' i say again and again `` please open the door please '' he look at me he look at me for a long time and then open the door after all ira come in with lilia we threw ourselves into each other 's arm cry then the man lock u into the bathroom we sat there for a long time through the door he told u `` calm the child and calm yourselves down too '' calm down this man be hiding u but what of our family when i be still in our apartment i have sense that none of u would come out of this alive i say `` igor edik let 's say farewell '' and edik turn around and look at me a if to say be that some kind of joke all the same i thought they would kill all of u igor look at me too but it be already too late they start pound on the door igor be stand next to the door before that he have told u `` go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight '' he thought we be in the room but before we go out onto the balcony we go to them '' edik igor let 's say farewell '' igor do n't think we could climb over to the other balcony and we do get over there and i myself ca n't believe we be able to save ourselves igor put on a helmet and edik have his coat on and he put on a fur hat all the men -- igor edik their father and misha ambartsumian -- they all stood next to the door they thought they would pound on it a while and leave but from the other side of the door they order in azerbaijani `` open the door '' we be all silent wait someone outside the door say `` they 're home they 're in there break down the door '' and i remember my father-in-law whisper `` they 're go to break it down now it 's come down now `` he have something in his hand i think it be a knife if they get in we be go to defend ourselves in the hall near the door there be two metal chair leg from outside the door they say `` we 're counting to five open up '' but we be all quiet we do n't answer them we make like no one be home we figure they 'd leave they 'd get tire and leave my father-in-law have say `` it 's not possible they 'd come into my home how can that be everyone know u all of sumgait know our family we be on good term with everyone '' and indeed a day do not pas that there be n't an azerbaijani guest at our table we have a nice dacha everyone would get together there often azerbaijani like be with u there too but now we have to save ourselves we have to flee from our own home ira i remember say `` i 'm not leave here my brother and my parent be here i 'm go to fight alongside them '' that 's just what she say she picked up a knife and say '' if they open the door and come into the apartment then i 'm go to fight alongside my family i 'm not go anywhere '' we be at sevil 's when they broke into our apartment we heard fight and shout the noise be terrible and when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the lezgin 's apartment you could hear everything up there too even ira 's voice i remember her call her mother several time she call her for a long time i start pound on the door in the bathroom `` open the door what be they do to ira who 's shout that 's ira shout that 's her voice '' but the lezgin say `` it 's nothing calm down no it 's not in your apartment '' he be lie to me so i 'd calm down two hour go by and the lezgin open the door and say `` karina igor get away calm down he ran away '' he saw igor break away and run off with his own eye they kill him outside next to the building while we be in the bathroom i experienced every possible human terror the way ira shout she shout `` save me mamma save me mamma mamma '' she repeat it several time there be a wild din there be very many people there all of them shout all of them bellowing howl whistle -- you just ca n't imagine what be go on what the roar be like apparently after they have kill ira those murderer come into the entryway where we be hiding and come upstairs all the way up to the fifth floor i do n't know if they be just look for any armenian or for u in particular but i think they be look for u because when we have climbed over the balcony someone on the street be say that the daughter-in-law be climb over the balcony and after we heard ira we heard them come up the stair in the entryway and hammer on the door i thought those be our last moment and start say good-bye to my child kiss them they be sleep i woke them up `` kristina seryozha wake up '' and i tell ira `` ira if something happens we 'll throw ourselves off the balcony '' we be on the fifth floor apparently our lezgin neighbor have open the door too because later he say `` i open the door and told them there be no armenian inside '' and after they all left our neighbor go out on the balcony himself to see they be go we be n't friend with those lezgin neighbor we only knew each other from the building but the people we be friend with would n't even consider hiding u the lezgin let u out of the bathroom they have a candle burning he say '' karina there 're no light on in our block '' the whole block be dark the whole block it 's a huge block too the lezgin say `` i 'm afraid to keep you until morning i 'm afraid of the neighbor they might kill me for save you '' i say `` what be you say we 'll leave now but we ca n't just leave with the child in the middle of the night give u time to find somewhere else to hide '' he say `` well ok go look '' i ask ira `` ira do you want to go '' ira say `` no i 'll stay with the child karina '' i say `` fine then i 'll go '' zhasmen and i go downstairs together it be very dark no one be in the courtyard it be dark pitch black l be afraid to go out at after seven igor always met me after work and accompany me home i never go out alone and now here i be out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that too it be probably after eleven later i call the boarding school and my director answer he say `` karina where be you '' i do n't know i be call from a public phone outside and do n't know where i be i get confuse and hung up the receiver from him i only found out what time it be i ask him `` what time be it '' he say 11:20 i think but i do n't really remember so anyway zhasmen and i go out into the courtyard i look and see what appear to be a person not far from our apartment and there be the smell of something burnt i become horrify i look at the corpse for a long time it be either ira or edik i only saw one of them zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeeze it `` hurry up let 's go hurry up come on what be you turn around for '' i turn around and saw a large truck it must have belong to the bandit because they come to kill u in a truck like that we live in the third entryway and that truck be next to the fourth we walk quickly hold hand i thought if i go to the police then they 'll put me away i could n't count on them before i reach the police station i saw a military vehicle we go over and i say `` soldier in block 41 i do n't know if they 've kill people or injured them -- we need to save them '' and he say `` go to the police station and tell them everything '' i say `` i 'm afraid to go there i 'm afraid of them '' he say `` do n't be afraid '' we go to the police and they write down the address and the military vehicle go to our building i do n't go with them they left me at the police station i give the address of my mother and my brother so that they 'd rescue them too i do n't know where they be or what have happen to them after a while they brought my child and ira and lilia first they take u to the kgb that be at two or three in the morning then around five they take u to the city party committee and there be very many people there very many i be pregnant and be wear nothing but a dress seryozha be only wear a shirt and kristina have a little dress on no coat no boot nothing and we sat there for three whole day in the city party committee the lezgin have told me that igor escape and i thought that he be probably alive but then after two and a half day they take u the armenian of sumgait to nasosny on march 6 some people from the central committee come and told u `` karina ira we need you come with u to the city party committee '' my mamma have come to nasosny and she have be look for me for six day mama my brother and my uncle we go to the city party committee and wait there in the courtyard i be wear nothing but a dress and ira have

sister-in-law sogomon melkumian my father-in-law and raisa melkumian my mother-in-law he read off all their name and say '' get in the car let 's go to the burial '' we bury our family i could n't believe it at the time i could n't conceive of it or imagine it and even now i think how shall i explain it to my child when they 're old my child be very attach to their father and their grandfather and grandmother kristina do n't love me the way she love her grandfather and grandmother they spoil her kristina would always announce `` my grandma be well than anyone '' now even though she be get use to my mother it 's difficult for her and once she told her `` you 're a bad grandmother '' i do n't know why i ask her `` kristina where 's papa '' and she say `` they kill him '' she know she

b"if you look at the bottom of this article you will see that i have very kindly dug up one of yigal arens previous posting entirely without his permission i hope he do n't mind contain translation from ha'arezt detail just such a case perhaps you think that ha'arezt lie would you like to provide me with an assurance that this practise *never* occurs right arab have be voting in israel for how long and in all that time not one arab ever gain enough of a personal follow to get his fellow party member to put in a ministry this be about a likely a sprout wing and fly to rio what basis do you have for explain this odd failure you seem very confident that you be right exactly how do you know why be you sure exactly what basis do you have for say this when the labour party have never put an arab into a cabinet post and insists it coalition member do the same why and on what basis be you reassure me in the face of 50 year of discriminatory practise hey what a i say even when their party put them up they get knock back it surely could n't be because they be arab be it well yes but security be the reason most often give by people who want to make excuse i merely thought it would crop up and so pre-empted it start of article all commets in ... .* be mine not dr. arens comment in square bracket be mine yigal racism in the knesset -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- coalition requirement on one hand and the presence of progressive mks from _meretz_ in the coalition on the other have compel rabin and his friend to change to some extent their attitude towards the arab public and their representative in the knesset although he do refuse to view them a partner take part in the coalition and join the government he do agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intention which include a commitment to `` work towards a decrease in the discrimination between jewish and arab citizen '' decrease what but poster have told u time and again that such discrimination do not exist *at* *all* be rabin too a closet self-hater yigal however racism have not disappear when the knesset sat to consider who would staff it various committee a request be make to put an mk from hadash the communist party one of the `` arab '' party yigal on the state comptroller 's committee and oh do that ever stir up a storm -- include in the rank of labor -- since many knesset member find it unthinkable that an arab mk sit on one of the important house committee `` security secret '' be liable to fall into their hand ... this attitude -- which until recently have not even arouse criticism be so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people 's heart -- hold that there be knesset member who despite have be elect by ten of thousand of vote be not entitle to be full partner in the body which represent the people of israel we be not speak here of political discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but of racial discrimination the proof one of the compromise propose be that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replace by tamar gojanski a jew yigal from the same party it be not the member's party which be consider unfit but his race ... here be a document case in a respect israeli newspaper it be worth note that for the first time since the state 's found a public debate have arisen on this subject a witness the follow article a test of self-confidence by gid'on levi ha'aretz july 26 1992 revelation of discrimination against arab have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there be not much effort make to deal with them do you hear that -- -- please contact this levi fellow and explain to him how little he know about israel please yigal except that sometimes the demon burst out from behind the government's window dress and then the phenomenon be seven time more serious last week provide two more such example the israeli knesset be find it very difficult to allow arab representation on it more important committee and israel television be find it no less difficult to give a platform to arab from the territory seemingly two entirely different matter but in fact they be one and the same the 13th knesset prove last week that even though one third of it member be new face it have not renew it own face at all at least on one issue parliamentary tradition may be modernize and parliamentary tradition may become obsolete and only one tradition endures forever no arab shall set foot in the more important committee of the house there have never be and never will be an arab mk on the external affair and defense committee or on the finance committee world have be overturn over the question of whether or not `` to give '' arab for the first time a place on the state comptroller's committee the argument be old and well-known in all three of the above committee innumerable secret be reveal -- and woe unto u if an arab should hear them one must not make light of such argument but their significance should also not be exaggerated every arab mk be not spending all his time wait for the opportune moment to hand over information from the knesset committee room to black panther headquarters in jenin and not all the aforementioned committee be continually occupy in the discussion of top-secret matter which could safely be reveal for example to mks supportive of the jewish underground but not to an arab mk from the likud labor or even from hadash the arab themselves would probably forego membership in the subcommittee on secret service matter but what would happen one may ask if mk nawaf masalha be to hear god forbid a review of the foreign minister in an open meeting of the foreign affair and defense committee or even a review of the army chief of staff which in any case be regularly leak to the next edition of the news and what would happen if mk hashem mahamid be to report on what he have see with his own eye at al-najah their non-participation in important committee and that of their colleague creates an intolerable situation where arab member of the elect house have only semi-positions they be good enough for address plenary session and for voting for or against the government and participate in the deliberation of the immigration and absorption committee but they must not for example participate in the process of formulate the state budget in the finance committee or in the allocation of resource to local authority in any case they have little part in that labor 's dependence on the support of the arab party have brought about some improvement mk hashem mahamid will it seem participate in the state comptroller 's committee earlier there have be a ridiculous attempt make to dictate to hadash who their representative should be and thus to prevent the arab from enter this dubious holy-of-holies but it soon become clear that there be no legal or constitutional backing for such a step but not to worry even now the jewish mind be contrive device the new committee chair roni milo have already announce that he will set up subcommittee aplenty for his committee thus he will decide where it be permissible for mahamid to participate and where not a solution such a this could by the way also have be adopt for the rest of the committee thereby completely eliminate the fear of state secret be leak to the enemy and remove the stain of discrimination from the knesset end article do you accept that a documentation joseph askew"

b"the annihilation of islam `` turk '' be an old serbian agenda but i strongly dispute your notion that croat have a similar old agenda in fact for the past century or two croat and muslim have see themselves a have a lot in common and they generally have friendly relation your suggestion that croat-muslim relationship be anything like serb-muslim relationship be completely wrong to say that croat and muslim have a lot in common do not imply they be not separate people the event of the past two year clearly show muslim determination to remain separate in their alliance with croat they maintain this separation croat would have accepted a much closer relationship i think this century plus of building bridge between these two friendly people be now at risk because of the inexorable logic of war since bosnian serb 32 of population have 10 time more heavy weapon than bosnian muslim 44 and croat 17 combine they have squeeze muslim and croat into only 30 of the territory muslim lose more territory than croat who built defense early on under these condition any alliance be bound to fall apart since it be easy to recover lose land from croat than from serb the only thing keep this in check be the hope of reversal of fortune through foreign military intervention and lift of the arm embargo since warren christopher have no luck persuade the european to go along with this this hope be dash have no prospect of outside help the former ally turn on each other like two starve animal in a tight cage this inexorable logic of course get plenty of help from serbian intelligence operative who be do everything to build mistrust between croat and muslim for over a year a timely intervention to stop serbian aggression would have prevent this sadly nothing be do to create a balance of power on the ground a long a the serb enjoy 10:1 advantage they can break any alliance even among friend this be tragic but hardly new `` divide et impera '' be use by ancient roman with success in my view bosnian muslim and croat manage to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until may 9 1993 when the hope of reversal of fortune be lose i have a question for the distinguish diplomat do they believe balkan people be experimental cannon fodder i 'd like to know what do they expect when they decide to enforce the arm embargo which solidify serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapon how do they expect to prevent fragmentation of the muslim and croat defense force and how on earth do they hope to restore peace without justice the implication of this immoral approach i can not begin to predict but i be fill with forebode ..."

los angeles until 1992 when he be fire by suall for illegally obtain police information to use against a rival at the simon wiesenthal center the fbi pointedly ask gurvitz if he have ever transmit

metamorphosis '' during the gulf war it also trace hamas fundraise through a plethora of allege front- group from plainfield indiana to culver city california it be doubtful that barsky could have

researcher for aipac whose spy operation be disclose last summer in the _voice_ `` the level of cooperation be very close '' slabodkin say during a recent phone conservation from israel where he be in graduate school `` if we felt our file be lack we contact the adl '' when sha'wan jabarin a 30-year-old palestinian human right worker in the occupy territory won a 25,000 reebok human right award in

aipac even open a file on musician jackson browne who present jabarin with the reebok award while the adl may be able to rationalize it close monitoring of arab and even left-wing gay revolutionary it have a far harder time explain it obsession with spy on anti-apartheid activist david gurvitz told the fbi that when he start work a a fact finder for the adl in l.a. in march 1989 adl file already bulge with information about the israel-south african connection and anti- apartheid group `` gurvitz confirm that the adl do routinely collect information on person engage in anti-apartheid activity in the united state '' say the fbi report while gurvitz say there be file in the l.a. adl office date to the 1930s he estimate the old material on anti-apartheid activity date back to the late 1970s parallel begin 's rise to power in israel and a deepen of tie between the jewish state and south africa `` in about august 1992 '' say the report of the fbi 's march 3 1993 interview with gurvitz `` an anti-apartheid demonstration be held at the south african consulate in los angeles participate in the demonstration be the los angeles student coalition and the socialist worker party gurvitz go to two demonstration planning session and a subsequent demonstration he write a report for the adl on each of the planning session and on the demonstration copy of the report be disseminate to bullock among others in care of the san francisco adl office '' in 1986 bullock learn that the consul general of the south african consulate in los angeles would be speak in la vega at a meeting organize by willis carto the head of the anti-semitic liberty lobby `` suspect that the consul general do not know who willis carto be '' say the fbi report `` bullock suggest to gerard that they might want to warn the south african gerard agree and inform the consul general who cancel his appearance '' a few month later gerard phone bullock and told him a south african intelligence officer want to meet them during a rendezvous in a hotel near fisherman 's wharf the south african say he be interested in acquire information on american anti-apartheid activist the south african who call himself mr. humphries also ask for information about group that be advocate divestments `` gerard who be present throughout the meeting '' say the fbi report `` told humphries that he gerard have be employ by the cia ... .humphries offer to pay bullock 150.00 per month in exchange for information bullock note that much of the information humphries say he want be already in the possession of bullock and the adl '' between 1987 and 1991 bullock sell information to south african intelligence receive steady raise which he split evenly with gerard `` bullock say it be his impression though gerard never explicitly told him so and bullock never ask that gerard may have be tell the cia about his and bullock 's contact with the south african '' say the fbi report `` gerard have say he knew the cia 'resident agent in san francisco ... .once after gerard drop bullock off at bullock 's residence follow a meeting with louie who replace humphries a their handler gerard say he be go to go to the san francisco cia office '' al the while gerard may have be `` task '' bullock for the cia `` bullock recall that once after he have met gerard bullock go to chicago illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the adl '' say the fbi report `` the target of the investigation be a group call the palestine human right campaign bullock learn that a woman name delete be transport money between the plo or the pflp and the united state bullock told this to gerard gerard later told bullock that gerard 's 'guy at the cia would like to know more gerard ask bullock if bullock would go back to chicago to gather more information on the palestine human right campaign bullock however never do go back '' gerard also seem to have have a close relationship with mossad which may have start in 1991 when he go on an adl junket to israel the adl frequently sponsor trip for american law enforcement official to israel where they be win and din and meet their counterpart in various intelligence agency accord to an affidavit by san francisco police inspector roth the `` all-expense paid trip to israel be more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the adl to continue the close relationship it have with specific law enforcement officer from the united state '' gerard may have like what he saw in israel a short time after travel there he go to addis ababa where he help with mossad's rescue of ethiopian jew a gerard 's relationship with south africa deepen he talk more openly about his exploit in the cia `` bullock recall gerard mention that he have be in algeria on cia business and that gerard discuss the plo and 'safehouses '' say the fbi report `` to this louie once respond that israeli intelligence have determine that the plo and the african national congress be cooperate gerard also spoke of have travel with the cia to afghanistan ... louie also told gerard and bullock about his adventure inside south africa a an intelligence officer both gerard and louie trade 'war story and regale each other and bullock with tale of 'narrow scrape '' although there be still much mystery about what trigger law enforcement 's investigation of the adl it be probably the theft of a classify fbi report on the nation of islam from the fbi 's san francisco office police arm with search warrant recover the report in the adl san francisco office gurvitz say he have sent a copy of it to mira boland the director of the adl 's fact find division in washington d.c. boland be prepare an op-ed piece for _the washington times_ in which she argue that the nation of islam should not receive federal fund for the reconstruction of l.a. because the group be anti-semitic and violence-prone boland who have arrange the adl police junket to israel attend by gerard testify in a 1990 criminal trial in roanoke virginia that she have work for the cia for 14 month and later be a subcontractor for the defense department before join the adl during the trial boland admit to share information with a cia official at an invitation- only adl conference after he be question by the fbi last fall gerard flee to the philippine which have no extradition treaty with america gerard be believe to have supply information from police computer not only to the adl but to israel and south africa a well the _san francisco examiner_ report that gerard may be charge with violate federal espionage law although bullock work for the adl for 30 year and irwin suall praise him in a july 1992 memo a `` our number one investigator '' the adl now argues that he be a rogue agent in it own defense the adl also asserts that it fact finder operate no differently than journalist after all ask adl official do n't journalist keep file but the difference between the practice of journalism and the adl's method of gathering information could n't be more strike journalist place information in the public domain where they be held accountable for falsehood distortion and libel and for the most part journalist do n't share their investigative file with foreign and domestic police agency the adl have no such inhibition because many of it file be not open to public scrutiny false information collect by ideologically bias researcher can not be correct once a proud human right group the adl have become the jewish thought police `` the adl say it 's a human right group not just for jew but for everyone '' say chip berlet a highly respect researcher at the massachusetts-based political research associate which monitor right-wing extremist group `` that 's fine but it ca n't do that and spy on palestinian it 's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral '' `` my argument to people be that the adl wear four hat each of the hat independently be appropriate it be a broad-based human right group that look at the broad issue of prejudice and discrimination it be a group that defends jew against defamation entirely noble nothing wrong with that hat it be a group whose leader at least consistently defend the action of israel against it critic which again be entirely appropriate and it be a group that maintains an information-sharing arrangement with law enforcement again there be nothing wrong for a group to do that '' `` but you ca n't do all four it be impossible to do all four and not violate the bound of ethic there 's a built-in conflict of interest if you wear all four hat '' adl national director abraham foxman apparently see no such conflict in a september 1 1992 letter to the _voice_ foxman complain `` adl have a proud 80-year record of fight bigotry and promote civil right and constitutional freedom any imputation of an effort or motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone be false and baseless '' '' throughout his piece on aipac 's spy friedman describes the dissemination of information a if it be slander and the existence of file a a token of mccarthyite inclination the depiction be mislead in several way virtually every journalist academic politician and organization keep file on subject they deem relevant trace the logic of friedman 's reckless charge the library of congress be tantamount to the kgb moreover disseminate the public record of a public figure be neither defamation nor mccarthyism '' but many believe the adl be increasingly in the defamation business ask jesse jackson james abourezk or the leader of the new jewish agenda -- all past target of adl smear at the same time the adl exonerate the fascist world anti-communist league which assist ronald reagan 's covert war against nicaragua a policy endorse by adl leader in the early 1980s researcher rus bellant and berlet ask to meet fact find head irwin suall to discus their work on anti-semite lyndon larouche `` our view then of irwin suall be that he be this really terrific investigator '' say berlet `` so we introduce ourselves say what we be up to and suall lean back in his chair and basically run down a dossier on each of u about what our political activity be who we work with what organization we belong to obviously he be just try to blow u away and he succeed admirably we be just sit there with our mouth open feel very uncomfortable '' `` and then he lean forward and say 'the right-wing be n't the problem the left-wing be the problem the soviet union be the big problem in the world for jew it 's the american left that be the big threat to american jew you 're on the wrong track you 're part of the problem we be stun i be virtually in tear this be not how i perceive myself we basically stumble out of there in a daze '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- letter response to friedman 's article the village voice may 18 1993 vol xxxviii no 20 a league of his own robert i. friedman 's assault on the anti-defamation league the anti- defamation league be spy on you '' may 11 demonstrates that he have an axe to grind and his own prejudice and bias agenda to promote it also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting be far down on his list the story be replete with inaccuracy innuendo and outright falsehood and conveys a picture of adl so divorce from reality a to be farcical friedman be even wrong on such basic easily determine fact a where adl be found chicago not new york and the building in which adl 's san francisco office be locate not the jewish community federation building picture adl have do the work of fight hater for 80 year without '' spy '' on organization or individual and with profound respect for the law our mission be to monitor and expose those who be anti- jewish racist anti-democratic and violence-prone and we monitor them primarily by reading publication and attend public meeting through the year we have publish score of report on anti- semitism emanate from both the left and the right in fact although friedman 's bias lead him to assume the contrary adl's primary concern be still the far right because extremist organization be highly secretive sometimes adl can learn of their activity only by use undercover source friedman 's hyperbole notwithstanding these source function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalist some have perform great service to the american people -- for example by uncover the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training camp -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk the information adl obtains be place in the public domain and through the year adl have establish a reputation for accurate reporting friedman 's article by contrast contains so much misinformation that it would take an article equally a long to set the record straight a few example he state that an `` adl leader be deeply involve in the jonathan pollard israeli spy operation '' and that pollard's handler 's wife `` work for the new york adl a a lawyer '' not true friedman also state `` adl investigator in unmarked van videotaped palestinian funeral '' not true elsewhere he asserts that adl be obsess `` with spy on anti-apartheid activist '' again not true we could go on and on -- and of course friedman do not reveal *his* source the distortion game friedman play when he mention number far reveal his lack of objectivity when it come to how much adl paid roy bullock a week -- a an independent contractor not an employee an important distinction friedman also fails to make -- he include the zero 75.00 150.00 invite the reader to see a large number by contrast when he observes that adl paid bullock `` nearly 170,000 '' between 1985 and 1993 he chooses not to point out that amount to little more than 20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum what be accurate about friedman 's story be chip berlet 's description of adl 's four hat yes adl look at broad issue of prejudice and discrimination yes adl defends israel against critic and yes adl maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement regard extremist activity and hate crime we see no conflict in these four activity and we believe most _voice_ reader won't either abraham foxman national director anti-defamation league manhattan -- -- -- -- -- -- --

three hour in relation to this a question arises a to why the ottoman warship refrain from participate in the bombardment the answer lie in report relate to the political movement that precede account of the progress of the expedition because the ottoman be unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace impose by britain in the area the sultan and the pasha promise their warship would not be use in the war against su'ud or any sheikh in the war zone kuwait which be not a party to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861 be under no such obligation especially since the expedition be not direct against

of kuwait throughout it history from both iraq and the ottoman the follow text discus a dispute on an estate call sufiyya in zubair iraq between the sheikh of kuwait and al-zuhair tribe in zubair in 1866 trouble developed over the possession by sheikh sabah of the estate which be purchase by his father sheikh jabir in 1836. this property be sequester by a turkish qa'immaqam representative on the basis of a claim by the al-zuhair that the vendor have be the owner of a share and not of the n 100e sufiyya at the same time sheikh sabah be require to expel from other land own by him at the island of fao some cultivator who have immigrate from persian territory it should be recall that the turkish official from the start show strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimant abdulla ibn sabah the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who go to basra a his father 's agent in the case narrowly escape be thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amount to the value of seven year produce which the ottoman authority deem the plaintiff be entitle to receive eventually the dispute be settle by the wali governor of baghdad in favor of the sheikh of kuwait the decision of the governor of basra in favor of the sheikh be apparently make for various reason some writer think that the governor want to win abdulla over to the turkish side and suggest that the governor namiq pasha even offer him the title of qa'immaqam which he decline nevertheless the proceeding of the turk in this case be regard by the inhabitant of kuwait a attempt to cause a confrontation with zubair it seem that they have anticipate a conflict and accord to report by the british agent at basra the people of kuwait be prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule lorimer suggests that the final order of namiq pasha uphold the kuwait sheikh 's title to sufiyya be perhaps due to a report that sheikh sabah `` with the object of attack zubair if the decision should go against him have obtain a promise of countenance and arm support from the wahhabi amir '' in addition to this legal matter with zubair kuwait have have other problem with basra whose court try to jail abdulla ibn

article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout it history from both iraq and the ottoman the british have always regard sheikh jabir a a `` good friend '' but in october 1839 an event take place at kuwait which could have weaken those good relation on october 30 lieutenant edmunds the assistant resident at abu shahr in iran arrive in kuwait on a special mission from the resident captain hennell his mission be to find out if kuwait be willing to welcome the establishment of a british line of post across the desert from kuwait to the mediterranean the british war vessel fire the usual salute in honor of the sheikh after it have anchor in the water of kuwait bay the salute be not acknowledge and edmunds wait in the vessel for three day before he be able to communicate with the sheikh after edmunds return to abu shahr both he and captain hennell explain this unusual behavior of the sheikh to have be due not to ill-will but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent at kuwait a to the nature of his relation with the british therefore they consider that jabir 's conduct do not indicate any change in his friendly policy towards the british if the british tolerate the attitude of jabir towards edmunds so also do the egyptian earlier in the same year some of the most want men in the wahhabi camp such a 'umar ibn 'ufaisan the wahhabi general in al-hasa and wahhabi tribe like al-duwaish sought refuge in kuwait protection of refugee seek political asylum in his country be a policy that have be adopt earlier by sheikh abdulla ibn sabah this can therefore be look upon a an indication of self-confidence an outcome of kuwait 's independence from foreign power it corroborates the fact that kuwait if necessary be prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbor this defense depend not only on the wall of the city but also on bedouin tribe in it neighborhood and a merchant fleet equip with the necessary gun comparable to other arab fleet of the time a to kuwait 's position between 1815 and 1839 one can safely state that it manage to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggle wahabi and egyptian relation with the british and even with the pasha of baghdad continued on good term source the modern history of kuwait 1750 -- 1965 by ahmed abu-hakima mcgill university canada -- they be try to recover land they

b"by elia davidsson april 1991 revision oct. 1991 note you be already post `` fact '' some of which be outdated the bias presentation of fact a well a the conclusion that you reach leave me little hope of engage in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a `` meeting of the mind '' it be to those who read with open mind that i address myself the international convention on the elimination of all form of racial discrimination adopt by the general assembly of the united nation in 1965 have now be ratify by most member state article 1 of this convention defines the term racial discrimination a `` any distinction exclusion restriction or preference base on race colour descent or national or ethnic origin which have the purpose or effect of nullify or impair the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human right and fundamental freedom in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life '' while the ideal embody in this text be worthy goal a the text currently stand i know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found it make no mention of the need for for a legislative violation the general assembly endorse in 1975 a resolution define zionism a a form of racism and racial discrimination the important correct and legitimate resolution be incomplete since it do not include operative statement design to end israeli racial discrimination meanwhile the united state on behalf of israel be exert heavy pressure on member state of the united nation to repeal this resolution and give israeli racial practice zionism moral legitimacy if you be in principle advocate un intervention via operative statement in this case it must therefore hold that they can be apply to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination a previously exhibit scarey thought the very definition of israel a a state belonging to the jew of the world but not to it inhabitant alienates all native non-jew born in that country actually i know quite a few native non-jew born in israel that be not alienate by this law if you have say some you would probably be correct however your tendency to exagerate and slant fact becomes apparent this slant permeates the text practically all non-jew who be living in or originate from area under israeli control identify themselves a palestinian most of them be muslim many be christian a few jew include the author of these line also identify themselves a palestinian the above statement be not true practically all discounting beduin circassian druze and some other fringe group your own identification be a matter that have no bearing upon the issue you could equally identify yourself a a insert group zionism take off in europe at the end of last century it 's aim be to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant opposition of palestinian arab 95 of the population if i recall correctly at the time `` zionism '' take off there be no adamant opposition in palestine i be open to any factual contradictory evidence but the zionist be more powerful militarily economically and technologically and succeed in 1948 in conquer 70 of the area of mandatory palestine after drive into exile most native arab from the conquer area approximately 750,000 people and raze most of their village to the ground the zionist could finally establish a predominantly jewish state only 150,000 non-jew remain on israeli territory do you therefore contend that the 400 village you mention far on `` most of their village '' once the jewish state be establish it begin enact law to help the confiscation of land from native non-jew their political repression and their destitution there be no doubt that law pass provide a framework which be later use for these purpose however you seem to imply that this be the intention a priori which implies a policy and agenda my knowledge be that this be not the case you also neglect to mention the circumstance that surround this a you do again below in 1967 the state of israel invade egypt and syria and occupy the rest of palestine the west bank and the gaza strip thus another 1.5 million palestinian fell under it juridiction it occupation of palestinian and other arab territory be consider illegal by the international community a reflect in security council resolution israel have reject all u.n. resolution and begin without delay to entrench it occupation and rule over these territory with the aim of annex them at the appropriate time not quite accurate israel have not reject all the resolution though it have conflict understand with regard to some of them israel never annexed the sinai west bank or gaza the other annexation be brought about partly due to the un resolution part of these territores east jerusalem and the golan height have already be forcefully annexed by israel in defiance of international law and un resolution out of curiousity provide that the annexees be grant citizenship what int l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territory capture in war have this ever be apply to any other country previously other than iraq it must be emphasize that although these people live under different regime they be united in their self-perception a palestinian that be a people identify with palestine a territorial entity not an ethnic or religious entity incorrect palestinian themselves claim to be discriminate against on an `` ethnic or racial '' basis therefore your above statement be incorrect i also note that give the previous definition of racial discrimination the only mean that you could argue for that be nationalistically however no such nation have exist it definitely do not exist at the time of the creation of israel in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period furthermore palestinian generally consider the plo both a a symbol of national identity and a the unchallenged authority that represent them in world affair once again some do some do n't the non-jewish population living in the palestinian and other arab territory occupy by israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant discrimination but be subject to brutal military occupation another generalization but then again you do n't seem to care about anyone other than the palestinian people whose cause you espouse licence to start a business and to buy industrial equipment the right to educate child all of these basic right be subject to arbitrary ruling by military authority and can not be challenged in court incorrect once again they have the ability to appeal furthermore although you may not agree with them not all of the military ruling be senseless or arbitrary some be but this be not due to the `` whim '' of the military a much a the sizeof the task/organization only jewish inhabitant of the occupy territory be permit to carry firearm incorrect once again i know two arab policeman who live in daheisha and there be more of course with the outbreak of the intifada they be force by the local to resign bitterly jewish settler have right to 6-7 more water per person than non-jew jewish resident of these territory number now about 100,000 people it be israel governmentus policy to increase this number substantially in total defiance of international law un resolution and the will of the population the state of israel systematically confiscates land from non-jewish inhabitant of these territory for jewish settlement that be no longer true and i ca n't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in post this some 800,000 people in israel proper be not jew most of them consider themselves palestinian with israeli citizenship for many year after the establishment of israel they be subject to harsh military control much of their land be confiscate by the state and hand to jewish organisation for exclusive jewish settlement they have be subject to massacre destitution and humiliation while they enjoy with jewish israeli the right to vote they be discriminate against both through law and in practice once again to hell with the other minority that do n't fit in right their be many village who do not suffer in the way you seem to indicate abu gosh come to mind yes some do but a a result of what action approximately 92 of the surface of the state of israel within the rgreen line be for all purpose close to palestinian who be second-class citizen in israel they may neither legally live on such land nor rent or cultivate it a direct effect of these policy be that native non-jewish citizen of israel be deny residence and membership right in most rural community in israel include the collective settlement kibbutz non-jew be discriminate against in many other way the government starves local authority of palestinian village and township of fund jewish city council force palestinian to live in ghetto jewish family receive high child allocation than their non-jewish neighbor palestinian school suffer underfunding and understaffing a compare to jewish school palestinian child be deny the right to learn their history and literature israeli who struggle for equal right and for the end of racial discrimination suffer continuous harassment by the authority 1. there be some kibbutz with arab/non-jewish member it be up to the member of the kibbutz there be no legislation against it nor against a purely non-jewish collective 2. fund be the result of political lobbying bearing in mind that non_jews compose ~20 of the voting population it have never fail to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc and increase their power the recent election be a case in point 3. please provide factual evidence support your allegation with regard to educational material you have obviously never see the curriculum of a school in the west bank it be base upon jordan 's school system 4. with regard to your last statement it be simply another gross generalization the state of israel refuse to acknowledge itself a the state of all it inhabitant although the israeli cabinet have never openly endorse the 'transfer idea the force removal from the country of it native palestinian population that be it ultimate judaization israeli government policy towards non-jew bear the mark of this 'final solution no attempt be make by the zionist authority to integrate palestinian arab into israeli public life thus although comprise approximately 17 of the population of israeli citizen no palestinian citizen of israel have ever serve a cabinet member a director of ministry or of a national institution a judge of the supreme court a ambassador of israel or in any lead position in israeli economic or financial life even the director of the ministry for arab affair yes such a thing exists be a jew another generalization but let not stop here the transfer idea be espouse by one party in the last gov't moledet it be intend to be a solution to the problem in the territory not the country itself with regard to other item i recall at least one arab ambassador and the rest be cover previously although sexual relation between and cohabitation of jew and non-jew be legal they be consider by israeli/zionist society somewhat a betrayal of the jewish and zionist ethic the israeli educational system nurture this attitude in a systematic way when be the last time you be in israel that be simply not true nor have it be for quite some time the question of religious intervention be best answer by the proportional representation and the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one zionism reject the idea of a modern secular state base on equality of all citizen this be one main reason why israel have not produce any write constitution simply incorrect the answer be political once again your failure to understand the dynamic and movement inside israeli gov't relegates your contention to the sideline zionism predicate a state where jew have privileged right thus accord to israeli law a jew born in london who have never visit israel do not speak hebrew and professes atheism be grant automatic israeli citizenship while native palestinian inhabitant who happen to be christian or muslim be treat almost a alien racial discrimination a define in international law be thus not only reflect in israeli law and policy but be ground in the very nature of israel a a jewish state but the discrimination be not base upon race oops sorry nasty habit i have of counter malicious false truth any proposal for israeli-arab and israeli-palestinian peace that do not address the issue of racial discrimination by israel that be the zionist nature of the state of israel be thus doom to fail real world intrusion any proposal that do be doom to fail of course i would n't

a brief glance on how the word 'hai 'haikazan and 'haiastan enter our old work accord to karakashian 'the word `` haik '' be never to be found employ with reference to a leader of the armenian people prior to moses of khoren nor be it ever found employ in the form `` haika '' or `` haykazn '' agahangelos and puzant use the word a a title or a place-name he improve and developed haiastan etc. if the word have refer to a nation and have be derive from `` hai '' or `` haik '' they could also have use the word `` haikak '' and `` haykazn '' in a number of place accord to professor sayce who decipher a number of hittite inscription 'in the hittite language the suffix -ha be use to specify quality or specie the word `` haddanas '' `` haddina '' be use by the assyrian to refer to the hittite with the transformation of the '' d '' between the two `` a '' letter to `` y '' `` hadinasdani '' be in this way transform to `` haiastan '' professor grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regard the significance and explanation so far accord to the term 'hai' and 'haistan a quite unsatisfactory he find however that a solution to this problem be brought nearer by the name 'haiasa which be so frequently found in bogazkoy from 1400 b.c onwards forrer take 'haiasa a refer to upper armenia in that case it seem likely that 'haiasa be actually a part of armenia the suffix

those girl for their indecent behaviour when he told the girl that the armenian include woman be generally more licentious than even the wild animal and that their indecent and shameful laughter be the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldier the armenian girl finally remember their sense of shame and claimed they have laugh because they be nervous an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrate the follow incident which take place on february 20 the armenian have nail a turkish woman to the wall they have cut out the woman 's heart and place the heart on top of her head the great massacre in erzurum begin on february 7 ... the enlist men of the artillery division caught and strip 270 people

26/27 february the armenian deceive the russian perpetrate a massacre and escape for fear of the turkish soldier later it be understood that this massacre have be base upon a method organize and plan in a circular the population have be herd in a certain place and then kill one by one the number of murder commit on that night reach three thousand it be the armenian who brag to about the detail of the massacre the armenian fight against the turkish soldier be so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldier who consist of only five hundred people and two cannon for one night and ran away the lead armenian of the community could have prevent this massacre however the armenian intellectual have share the same idea with the renegade in this massacre just a in all the others the low class within the armenian community have always obeyed the order of the lead armenian figure and commander i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectual be accessory to these murder no for there be people who oppose the armenian for such action since they understood that it would yield no result however such people be only a minority furthermore such people be consider a traitor to the armenian cause some have seemingly oppose the armenian murder but have support the massacre secretly some on the other hand prefer to remain silent there be certain others who when accuse by the russian of infamy would say the follow 'you be russian you can never understand the armenian cause the armenian have a conscience they would commit massacre and then would flee in fear of the turkish soldier the incident that occur only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the armenian ideology nothing which be already do can be undone ''

b"alberto you 've repeatedly misunderstood my posting you be now make the exact point that i 've make several time but with a different definition of religion you do n't not have to believe in the `` religious '' aspect of judaism to be a jew this would confine judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a christianity. so by convert out of judaism i do n't mean just not believe in the god of judaism i mean voluntarily remove yourself from the jewish nation i be an agnostic but still consider myself jewish because of my cultural heritage i admit that many religious jew would argue that i be not completely jewish because of my lack of faith but judaism be a religion of dissent and debate be n't it the fact that one can opt to become jewish simply by convert to judaism make the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most open nation we have no quota so i will once again make my point define a member of the jewish nation by religion not a you say religious belief be not racism you come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism"
b"dear mr. beyer it be never wise to confuse `` freedom of speech '' with `` freedom '' of racism and violent deragatory '' it be unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial distinction in fact if a speach be not offensive to some it protection under freedom of speach law would be useless it be speach that some find questionable that must be protect be it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist it be only through civilize discourse and not scare tactic that one can enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant that be the idea behind freedom of expression what you find offensive might be perceive a truth by some and what they might find offensive might be your belief it be only through free exchange of idea and insult a the case seem to be with this channel that one can change another 's err ways.that be why jefferson say that here we be not afraid to `` tolerate error so long a reason be left to combat it '' do this mean that you be volunteer to wade through the mutlu/argic deluge that come in every day some of u be tire of be drag into content-free piss contest with reflexive bigot we intensely dislike be stuck between let this crap pas without comment a though it be unremarkable and reply to it and get suck in again let 's keep some perspective here imho the josh 's policy of forward the garbage in question without comment to the relevant sysadmin strike a good balance the stuff be after all publish on a public forum -- from that very site yet hardly a matter of confidentiality or copyright if the local administration want to do something about it they have that right if not nobody 's twist their arm"

them they lay still not move a though nothing be left of them one person be lie there and they start drag him the police be stand right there to the side not do anything they do n't take any step to calm that mob it be awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony and you could n't go anywhere somehow you want to be able to see everything so a to tell of it later we want to leave sumgait that day what kept u be the idea that we live in the soviet union and that something would be do about it where in the world be our government -zinaida we could n't leave town of course because our old daughter wasn't home and at the same time i be terrify for gaya and diana on sunday morning when i go to see ira home our neighbor say `` zin you know they go into valodya 's house and smash everything he have they murder his father and two son '' valodya be our neighbor he 's an armenian he life on the first floor i think my god what be happen and in broad daylight i saw ira home and when on the way back i come across a mob shout `` slay the armenian karabagh be ours '' this be at 12 o'clock in the afternoon on the way i stop into a bread store and the saleswoman say `` they beat our store manager they thought he be an armenian and they beat him but he be an azerbaijani '' and i ask `` do they kill him '' she say `` no he 's in serious condition '' i left there and start to

it go on from about six in the morning until twelve at night at midnight they disperse and the police take their place they be scatter about in all district but how can you explain the fact that by morning when it have already start get light around seven o'clock our police be go the police disappear and yield their position to the bandit in the morning they start gathering at our inter- section again at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown from morning on all the road and mass transit stop be cover and by nine o'clock you could n't even see the ground there be thousand of people in the crowd again they begin stop vehicle and check for armenian -zinaida they have signal i realize that when i notice that they make a cross with their arm they cross their arm over their head the cross evidently meant that the vehicle have armenian in it they let the azerbaijani car through and they stop the armenian one and start their pogrom -gayane they stop a white zhiguli and ask the driver what his nationality be he get out and say they be from baku `` but what be your nationality '' he say armenian they immediately start shout `` ermeni ermeni '' and he say `` what 's go on i 'm come from baku i do n't live in sumgait '' `` do n't matter who care if you 're from baku or sumgait '' anyway the crowd pounce on him and start beating him and they drag a woman -- his wife probably -- out of the car at this point the police come and take the two and lead them away then the mob start smash the car and then burn it the flame blaze it be a horrible fire then everyone ran away they thought the car be go to explode about 20 minute later another car come along a green moskvich they ran up shout `` ermeni ermeni '' but this time they do n't pull the people out of the car they didn't beat them maybe they burn them along with the car because no one emerge from the flame the neighbor boy vakhit be stand on the balcony too acquaintance of his walk by below and he ask them and they say `` yes they burn them along with the car '' about two hour later a whole wedding procession come by and there be a doll on the first car we thought they be armenian but the car start to honk loudly they be azerbaijani and they be immediately allow through -zinaida the driver wave his hand a if to say 'get out of the way the whole crowd part and the procession pass through freely -gayane by the way at the marriage hall which be right in the courtyard of our building there be a wedding that day the azerbaijani be cele- brating and dance on the street there be grief and death people be be kill and people be celebrate the whole time -zinaida before the apartment itself be attack i ask gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus be suppose to arrive she go to her girlfriend 's in the building she life in the first entryway on the third floor gaya come back and say `` mamma the bus be suppose to come around eight after eight '' you can imagine what i be feel how hard it be vika knew nothing about what be happen and be come to meet her death then i heard shout i race to the window and see that the belonging of our neighbor from the second entryway be be thrown outdoors they be thrash about with the pillow and the feather be lie like snow i start to cry i be walk around the room cry wail vika 's not here what will come of her gaya of course be console me `` mamma nothing will happen to her do n't worry calm down she 's in good company they 'll look out for her '' diana i saw the green car burn the car be burning when we go out onto the balcony gaya push me away tell me to get off the balcony i left then they come up to the balcony and ask if there be any armenian here -zinaida you 're right i forgot about that that be on the 27th diana there 's a small grassy area in front of our balcony there be tree plant there the mob ask if there be any armenian in the building all the neighbor say no there be no armenian here there be n't a lot of armenian in our building but there be n't just a few armenian family either -gayane they fell upon the apartment on the 28th there be terribly many of them our courtyard be huge and it be completely fill with them -zinaida katusev have make an appearance on television earlier he say that two people azerbaijani have be kill in karabagh and when he say that you know how bee sound have you heard how they buzz it be like the buzzing of million of bee and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard howl and shout i do n't know how to describe it by this point we be afraid to watch from the balcony but when i look out of the bedroom window -- the znaniye bookstore be down there and armenian live on the second and fourth floor -- i saw their thing be thrown out the window i realize that they would be upon u any minute i shout to gayane `` gaya hide the gold '' that 's honestly what i told my child i grabbed diana i do n't know what to do vika still be n't home and it be already get dark i be afraid to look at the time because i be already horrify a it be -gayane just in case we change the television channel from the moscow station to the azerbaijani one -zinaida and turn it up loud -gayane we never listen to azerbaijani music it just do n't do much for u in all those year we almost never listen to it but sometimes we would watch some entertainment show or film on azerbaijani television and that be it and here we have it turn up full blast so they would think we be azerbaijani -zinaida well you can imagine they 're slaughter armenian rob them and we 're listen to this concert music from baku our azerbaijani neighbor suggest we do it they knock on the door and told gaya to turn on azerbaijani music but we already have it on anyway turn on the light they told u so they will think you 're not armenian they 're say the armenian be afraid to turn on their light they 're hiding -gayane apparently there be some kind of arrangement because we notice that the light be off only in armenian apartment that be the azerbaijani be warn and every last one of them have their light on when we turn the light off two of our neighbor come immediately and later another one `` turn on the light '' they told u `` please nothing will happen be calm nothing will happen '' -zinaida `` we wo n't allow them to come into your apartment '' -gayane we believe those people we have never do anything bad to them -zinaida after the whole nightmare about march 15 before we left for armenia when i be come into the building they be all cry the azerbaijani be cry say `` can it be there be no god how could they raise their hand against your family you never do anyone any harm you never refuse anyone anything not in hard time or in time of fortune or in time of mourn how could they give you away how could they sell you down the river '' they really have give u away some of them protect u but others give u away they sell u down the river -gayane i be wear slack that day and when it all begin i become cautious for some reason and i change my clothes azerbaijani woman do n't wear pant young armenian and russian girl in sumgait wore pant but the azerbaijani found that very strange and i thought i well put on a skirt otherwise they wo n't believe me if i told them we be azerbaijani there be nothing else we could do no other way out i be force to turn myself into god know who i let my hair down tousle it and threw a scarf over my head -zinaida and she told me `` mamma you hide take diana and go into the other room you two look more like armenian they 'll figure out that we 're armenian right away '' but how could i go away and leave her there -gayane i go out onto the balcony it work out well that way we be the only armenian family in the fourth entryway this give u hope we be the only one the neighbor would n't let them in they the azerbaijani would fear for themselves and for their child i look and saw someone crawl up on the balcony from below it be easy to get up onto our balcony when we would lose the key the neighbor would let up into their place and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way so i turn around and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony he look at me and shout `` what nationality be you here '' -zinaida at the same time they be knock on the door -gayane `` what nationality be you '' he 's shout well at first i be frighten but then i get control of myself and answer in perfect azerbaijani `` you should be ashamed of yourself ask a question like that ca n't you see i 'm an azerbaijani if i be an armenian would i come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eye '' he look at me and tell the people with him `` yes azerbaijani live here '' from below they tell him '' check it out it ca n't be they have to be armenian '' and he asks me again '' what nationality be you '' i say `` ca n't you see '' i start fume i could not say anything else `` you 're blind that 's for sure you can yell all you want but that wo n't make u armenian '' i hear them break down our door and mamma go toward the door i say `` i do n't have time to deal with you they 're break down our door '' 1 go to the door and ask `` who be it '' they answer `` open up '' i say `` wait why be you break the door what 's go on i 'm opening up '' we never lock the low lock it be broken but now they have lock it out of fear and i could n't get it open i say wait i 'm look for the key i open the door -- it be almost broken down already i open the door and they burst in i say `` what 's go on why be you break down our door '' -zinaida then they start climb in from the balcony they 're shout '' why do n't you open the door '' and i say `` well you 've already come in the balcony '' then diana see their knife run into the bathroom and close the door gaya cry out `` mamma diana ran into the bathroom '' i ran to the door and forgot that we be pretend to be azerbaijani and say in armenian '' diana open the door '' gaya try to calm them down and i 'm shout with tear in my eye for diana to open the door -diana i be sit on the couch with my doll little red rid hood that guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle they put it up to mamma 's stomach i ran to the bathroom open the door and slam it behind me i be frighten and start to cry i shout `` mamma they want to kill you '' and then then they start shout `` give u your passport '' and gaya say `` what do you need passport for we 're azerbaijani '' -gayane i try to convince them that we be azerbaijani i be try everything i could i could get on my knee and plead i could humble myself because at that moment i be worried about other life than just my own to be honest i do n't care about anything else a long a my little sister would survive her life and health have cost u so dearly i tell them `` what do n't you understand anything '' they start shout they be tremendously excite shout with terribly loud voice say that in stepanakert their girl be be kill rap and toss around with pitchfork why should n't they do the same to u i say `` who 's do all that who be do it some armenian what do that have to do with u give me the knife i'll cut my own face '' `` now you calm down '' they tell me zinaida i told them `` why do n't you deal with them there there in karabakh nothing have happen here no one have be fight here not we with the armenian nor they with u why do n't you give it right back to them there what 've we get to do with this '' i get confuse i have be say that we be azerbaijani but suddenly i start speak a though i be an armenian but they do n't notice one of them be next to me with a knife at my breast and he say to the others `` what pretty girl '' he meant gaya and my 10-year-old diana i be terrify gaya start assure them that we be azerbaijani one guy stood in the doorway and give u bad look -gayane he demand the passport i say `` young man i do n't have my passport here '' he say `` let 's have the passport we wo n't believe you without your passport '' and one of them start hurriedly search for document they turn the wardrobe in the other room upside down take the picture off the wall and start pull the clothes off their hook yell and shout `` passport passport '' they all start yell there be so much noise in the apartment they be all shout my hair stood on end suddenly i say `` listen my
