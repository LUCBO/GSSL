b'i believe the nhl draft be on or the june 18th weekend'
b"well your majesty could n't you just picture it cherry start do his first post-game interview with barrasso tommy give him that little look like somebody crapped on his shoe and then proceeds to give don a tonsilectomy with his sher-wood now that you could put on pay-per-view hope you have a good laugh"
b"wood be fairly small for an enforcer-type i mean fleury do a pretty good job and be n't that large but dody be no fleury have be witness to three or four of his fight closeup he simply isn't ready to fight at an nhl level assume that it 's his role which be all he really show u in his few game up from k.c -- if he can pas shoot or skate i never saw much of it all he have be a right fist which be n't bad but at the nhl level the other player be smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant once you control that hand he 's a fish flop on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he want to him his entire strategy seem to be keep the hand out of reach until he found an opening -- and i never once saw him find an opening worth talk about he get neutralize quickly and stomp on a couple of time unless he show some new trick in camp he 'll be on my `` career minor leaguer '' list since this be his first taste of the nhl i expect the shark give it to him so he 'd know what he 'd have to work on off-season he need to get strong he need to get more speed and he need to show some versatility a something else than a simply goond because he wasn't particularly good a a goon"

b"-= quote cire y. trehguad to all =- cyt hey i be in iowa and i do not mind espn show the pitt/njd game cyt at least i get to see the devil ... even if they be gettin there as cyt kick perhaps they will score and even win a game or two cyt go devil i be sorry to tell you this but i do n't think the devil will win a game against pittsburg the penguin have so many score threat that you shut down one and another will kill you it 's too bad but i must conclude that the penguin will win their third stanley cup in a row i hope someone will beat them but i just can not see it happen s t e v e"
b"m -- be doom to 4'th in the division i 'm still not convince the m -- sabre will win this series i 've live in buffalo all my life and m -- these last 10 year have be playoff hell but i 'm just sit m -- back cross my finger and hop the offense can keep score have no fear doug the bruin be toast statistically only 2 team in **all** the stanley cup series ever played have come back to win and it could n't have happen to a nicer team with all the crow from boston fan i 've have to endure over the last month take heart bruin fan at least you finish first in the adam sinister chuckle jack laugh and the world think you 're an idiot"
b"match the makarov offer be the only real mistake dave king have make this year i have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who be obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year 2 million contract risebrough match the offer on king 's request and makarov have spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stink not to mention that he 's lose a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty pass i think makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract he 's ineffective in calgary but he might be able to help a team like san jose with their shortage of talent if there 's no taker and makarov do n't show improvement in training camp i think the flame will just bite the bullet and buy out makarov 's contract and release him with his current attitude he be a detriment to the team"
b"do you notice that _nobody_ on the team be willing to take charge a dominant defenceman would be nice ... .too bad schneider get hurt he reminds me of chris chelios sometimes speak of chelios i wonder if serge savard feel like a moron for make that trade i also wish we still have corson rob ramage on the ice be less useful than a gatorade bottle on the bench vincent damphousse have decide to take a vacation apparently i have no idea why demers be play denis savard on the check line with carbonneau savard be skate well and be one of the only dangerous canadiens in quebec 's zone with the puck too bad nobody be in front most of the time do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single nordique get knock down it 's disgust we also have lebeau 5'10 '' 172 get paste at centre ice by wolaninn 6 3 '' 205 with no reply from the team except to yell for a penalty dammit denis savard threw the best only montreal hit of the night when he knock sundin off-balance when denis savard be your team 's enforcer there's big trouble someplace ... aside from that second goal roy do stand on his head the third period at least provide something to look forward to habs won the period imo and i guess somebody finally come along to smack them a couple of time in the second intermission to remind them that a game have start at 7:30. hopefully they play that way at home roy make the save we 'll ignore that second goal so now it 's up to the team -- dchhabra stpl.ists.ca"
b"why dc/baltimore be one of the top medium market =the only thing the nhl seem to care about these day they 've be do far well than the nba bullet at the gate for the last five year the team have be a perennial contender and fan support have be good to excellent why should pollin move to city that 's five time small but have a many team in other pro sport i do n't get it ..."
b"i do n't `` notice '' ref and linesman until the playoff come around and yes i have to agree that stewart call the *two* bad game i 've see so far mtl-quebec game 1 and last night toronto-detroit game what 's the scoop on this guy be he the late incarnation of kerry fraser just because you be boneheadedly stubborn doesn't make you a good ref make the right call do ... my vote for best ref van hellemond most improve koharski bad paul stewart oops i do n't really want to start a best/worst ref thread so don't follow up"
b"i applaud the sabre for make the deal to get fuhr specifically because i thought it would help them win at least one playoff series however i don't think the leaf can be fault either ... there be nothing to say that felix wo n't be win playoff series by himself in year to come anyway do anybody else find it ironic that fuhr be up against moog or at least he be until a guy name alex show up ..."
b'ok buffalo fan i be a red wing fan but be amaze at how the sabre be beating up on the bruin be there any reason for this be it grant fuhr or mogilny and lafontaine i would like to hear from you since i do not know much about the sabre'
b"okay ... here 's some gripe '' ing '' grip ... whatever i live in santa barbara ... for reference ... i think okay abc show the kings/flames ... fine ... yawn espn through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game show the red wings/toronto game ... cool but i swear that the advertisement all week long have say that espn would show pitt/nj on tuesday and bos/buff on thursday i race home from work early 4:30 pacific to catch the game but ala it be the boston/buffalo game and then they promise that they would show the pitt/nj game on thursday overnight they change their mind i do n't mind that much i watch the game hockey be much well than no hockey during the game their be no video highlight from the patrick division what the hell be go on at least they should show video highlight of the other game especially the nyi/caps game that be so close my father life in bowling green kentucky bumbf*ck egypt get to watch the pen game on espn i just do n't get it the big problem be that buffalo or boston fan who do n't want to see the pittsburgh/new jersey game 2 will turn on their tv on thursday and see the pittsburgh/new jersey game 3 instead of the buffalo/boston game 3. at least in my case i just have to wait 2 more day to see my game if i be a big boston or buffalo fan and i miss the game on tuesday due to false advertising on the part of espn i 'd be mad a hell oh well ... hopefully we 'll get well coverage next year or something matt coohill"
b'roger shut up thank you'
b"yeah i think we 're use to it by now even if some of u do change our .sigs to root for our second favorite team i 'll be happy if they win it before i get out of school the way it 's go i may be here say pile high and deeper before long i have a feel that alot of people out there may not like this statement but ... ... by far the bad `` band wagon '' fan be the pit fan at least at the present case in point -- i know a guy who just come to hockey hell tm from pitt u. him `` how 'bout the pen the 're f-ing awesome '' me `` yeah but beating up on the devil do n't mean alot wait until they meet boston and/or detroit in the playoff start '' him `` when do the playoff start '' me `` uhhhh they start a week ago '' i 'm not say that this be true of all the waddler fan but there seem to be alot of them float around who really know nothing about hockey except that they 're newly beloved waddler be the best team in the game right now and when they 're not the best team those fan will disappear into the woodwork john flame dev/null serious comment welcome `` eat the rich ''"
b'i be sure some bashers of pen fan be pretty confuse about the lack of any kind of post about the recent pen massacre of the devil actually i be bit puzzle too and a bit relieve however i be go to put an end to non-pittsburghers relief with a bit of praise for the pen man they be kill those devil bad than i thought jagr just show you why he be much well than his regular season stats he be also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoff bowman should let jagr have a lot of fun in the next couple of game since the pen be go to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway i be very disappointed not to see the islander lose the final regular season game pen rule'

b"stuff delete the last year before bryan murray take over the wing do not make the playoff while they have be consider a possible contender when jacques demers first arrive in his last two year they be respectively embarrass in the first round by chicago and then fail to make the playoff at a time a might add when there be only five team in the norris it 's true that vancouver do not make the playoff for many a year before quinn come but in those year the smythe division be a lot -- i mean *a lot* -- tougher division than the norris also know a the `` snorris '' division vancouver have to play edmonton and calgary both very legitimate stanley cup contender eight time a year while detroit get to play such powerhouse a toronto and minnesota now edmonton be hardly even a force in the league and the smythe even have the mighty san jose shark while over this same period of time in which vancouver be improve so be everybody in the norris except st. louis detroit have to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division they have to improve *a lot* to get well than their competition in the norris bryan murray inherit a team with very little talent for really good player they have yzerman burr and probert and that be about it and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert be that good the rest be either very green rookie or wash up veteran the only reason they get a far a they do in the year before murray come be due to the coach of demers who at least at first get every last ounce of effort possible out of his team then even his coach begin to degrade there be a number of reason why detroit be n't in a bad a shape standing wise when murray take over a vanc be when quinn take over some of which i outline above but murray do not have any well personnel to work with at the outset than do quinn with the exception of yzerman and one player can not alone make a team into a stanley cup contender a i 'm sure everyone reading this will agree we 'll be able to see well which team be really the most improve when they face each other in the conference final assume they do n't get knock out like last year"
b'fan into the game but surely they would rather see broten take a pas from kovalev and score a breakaway goal to put the ranger up 3 magic goal in the third period rather than see kocur take another stupid penalty and the ranger give up another powerplay goal the ranger need another top flight center who can take the pressure off messier and the first line nemchinov be a perfect third line center so who go beezer or richter'
b"on tuesday when it be rain in chicago espn provide bonus hockey coverage now it seem a though some fan be ticked off that the ny-wash ot be replace with the angels- game people must realize that there be more baseball fan instead of hockey fan in the u.s the baseball game be schedule to air and advertiser money be paid so they ca n't skip the baseball game why do n't you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get well partly because i a an ardent fan of both sport would rather see game 3 of the nhl playoff than game 3 of 162 of the mlb season even if the bb game involves the red sox espn may have have contractual obligation i understand that part but it 's a bit inaccurate to call u `` selfish '' just because we want to watch the watch the game we love be i a a baseball fan `` selfish '' when i get piss a cbs for show approximately one game per month i do n't think so while espn may have contractual obligation we a their consumer have a right to voice our displeasure with how they be serve u there 's certainly nothing wrong with that"

b"i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that while it 's true that the entire sabre team played very well i still believe that if it be n't for grant fuhr the series would now be tie 2-2. he virtually stole game 1 and 3 for the sabre in both of these game fuhr stood on his head to give the sabre the chance to win especially in game 3 fuhr make a series of huge stop in the third period when the score be tie 2-2. even in game 2 when the sabre won 4-0 the score seem to indicate that the sabre dominate however if it have n't be for fuhr the sabre would n't have be up 2-0 i think it be through the 2nd period and the bruin would n't have have to open up the game thereby allow mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game there be no doubt in my mind that fuhr be the critical factor in the victory in my opinion neely oates and juneau played a well a lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabre do get extraordinary effort from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compare to that of the bruin checker however the bruin defense imo played well than the sabre defense the sabre have ken sutton play a regular shift afterall the difference in the series be fuhr who outplayed andy moog gary"

b"i agree that keenan be an excellent choice do you see mike lupica 's column in sunday 's news my sentiment exactly i think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire into their heart next season either that or he 's go to be kick alot of butt i 'm here but be new to this group and have be keep fairly quiet you know do the `` lurk '' thing i do n't have a sense how many ranger fan there be on the list either i be a die-hard ranger fan i guess i have to be i sat in the garden throughout the penguin lead by mario 's 5 goal decimation of them on 4/9 but be sick at the abundance of talent that have be totally untapped and the lack of heart displayed this season hurlbut be injured for quite a while i 'm not sure but i think he may have recover in time for the playoff run and if so like you question why he be n't use i believe kocur be use in many instance for his intimidation factor grant he seem to get an awful lot of ice time for that reason alone but you have to realize that when a team be not do any real physical intimidation i 'd like to have a nickel for every time j.d say 'they 've get to take the body more you 've get to at least have some illusion i agree and i do n't know sorry i do n't agree with you here i think joey c. do a good job fill in when he be ask to i ca n't imagine that it's easy go from near 0 ice time to be a full timer i don't seem to remember him turn the puck over at the blue line too much or fail to clear the zone he work hard and at least do n't make any rookie mistake a he say himself in an interview he can only give what he have and he do absolutely i think attendance at the garden be well on the last day of the season than any average night for the islander the man be awesome in a way i 'm enjoy the playoff more now that the ranger be n't in them i can really appreciate all the glory mario be get without 'hating him because he's on the oppose team he deserves it all a far a i'm concerned mary"

b"here be something crossposted from the ahl mail list in a discussion between me and chris lerch the subject of springfield 's 1st round upset of the providence bruin come up chris basically raise the possibility that the ahl hierarchy be bias in favor of the indian he note that the office for the league be in spring and many ex-indians be work for the ahl furthermore he also inform me that back a few year ago in the cup final between roch and spring that the amerks charge favoritism by the office and that '' ... there be little questionable thing liket he ahl president and staff attend all game with the springfield brass include sit in their box for the game in springfield and accord to the rochester medium openly cheer for springfield '' certainly this be something that be quite serious if any of this be true i do n't know if this be anything more than whine on the part of the amerks they have pull this sort of crap against the wing before but if true this be somthing that seriously raise question about president jack butterfield 's leadership btw- this be post with the permission of chris"
b"hey american hockey fan a a hockey fan i can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel the problem be that other american do n't give a shit about hockey they view it a a bunch of canadian with bad accent and miss teeth beating the shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it be too warm now in two-thirds of the u to see the stuff naturally on the other hand baseball be the *gasp**swoon**sigh* `` national pasttime '' baseball be so romanticize in the u that you be suppose to forget that other sport exist after april 1 and before november 1. i feel that since espn show 5+ baseball game a week they should be able to show an ot hockey game instead of the opening inning of a baseball game hell the game be go to last 2hrs 45mins so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hr and i be an indian fan show the end of what you start then switch but then i 'm a hockey fan what do i know baseball be the all mighty sport"
b"i 'd like to add that i think canadian hockey fan like don because his kind of hockey the hockey he promotes in his tv appearance be the kind that they think use to get played in the old 6 team nhl so there 's a kind of nostagia for the old day before expansion the soviet series gretzky and even bobby orr when guy be n't afraid to take a hit nobody float and defensemen played defence who care that that probably never really exist the myth be still around in canada and all the european in fluence on the game have diminish it in some people 's eye personally i 'd like to add before i get flame i love the fast-paced `` european '' game and think don cherry be a bit of an idiot i have to say that i miss him when i be living in the state though he be entertain even if you end up throw your popcorn at the screen when he 's on -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i stand by all the misstatement that i 've make -- vice president dan quayle to sam donaldson 8/17/89"
b"bleep bleep bleep the bruin lose again in o.t i ca n't stand it aside from frustrate raving i must give buffalo credit they be make good on most of their score opportunity and be play great defense boston player ca n't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the buffalo net except for on rare occasion the buffalo defense be also do an excellent job clearing away rebound fuhr be play great when the big save be need but he 's also get plenty of help boston have be play rather well well than would be indicate by the series score of 3-0 but be lack that extra drive in the earlier part of the game a a result boston keep leave the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goal down this must stop if boston be to have any hope of win a single game the outlook for the bruin 's advancement to the second round be quite bleak imho the bruin need to score first if they can do that they have an excellent chance of win since they have outplayed the sabre in the 2nd and 3rd period the scary thing be that i 'll be go to grad school in buffalo next year i 'll never cheer for the sabre ... you ca n't convert me ... mtm3"
b"i have to agree wholeheartedly with this view i do n't like to see stickwork but you have to clear player away from in front my personal favorite move i 'm a goalie too be to give the off player a good whack on the back of their skate when the ref be n't look make 'em go down like a ton of brick but do n't cause injury unless they do n't know how to fall i 'm talk about hit the blade here not the foot it also make the player you hit and anyone who see really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty unfortunately it also leaf your blocker out of position for a short time ... i do n't do this if a shot be likely on the short side hmm ... .maybe i should mail potvin this method in french and with helpful diagram of course it sure would be nice to see ciccerelli who i have a great deal of respect for btw he 's not a big guy but he play huge fall on his back a few time"

b"on tuesday when it be rain in chicago espn provide bonus hockey coverage now it seem a though some fan be ticked off that the ny-wash ot be replace with the angels- game people must realize that there be more baseball fan instead of hockey fan in the u.s the baseball game be schedule to air and advertiser money be paid so they ca n't skip the baseball game why do n't you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get"

na-na-na hey-hey good bye '' such talk be a tad premature there 's still one game left but the blue be on a roll they have the blackhawks on their heel the blue set the tone early on friday with two crunch hit in the first minute of play rich sutter level bryan marchment and brendan shanahan dumped steve smith at center ice chicago try to retaliate but troy murray 's decision to run into joseph backfire referee dan marouelli give him a rough penalty the blue do n't get a shot on goal on the power play and they survive a scare after chicago kill the penalty when rick zombo give the puck away to steve larmer joseph stop larmer 's shot and everything else chicago threw at him in the first period the 'hawks ignore the scout report on joseph about shoot high and continued to shoot low where joseph 's butterfly style be deadly rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalty midway through the period -- two for hook and one for hold -- but chicago get only two shot on goal a many a miller the blue penalty killer twice stole the puck and just miss on good score chance against belfour marouelli begin call penalty on the blackhawks to even thing up he caught brent sutter hook shanahan four second after hedican 's third penalty he call marchment for elbow janney along the board at 14:58 and give the blue a two-man advantage 1:07 later when christian ruuttu slash shanahan the blue work around the puck on the ensue power play and hull get it where he like it -- in the high slot hull 's shot hit belfour 's right shoulder and the puck bounce precariously close to the goal line belfour dive back to cover but the puck squirt loose to janney who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoff the blue continued their relentless hit a the period end and the blackhawks lose their composure joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two second remain in the period and after time have expire smith upset the blue by shoot the puck into the blue bench chris chelios make a move toward joseph a the team left the ice and marouelli slap him with a 10-minute misconduct chicago survive the blues' power play but the loss of chelios hurt he do n't return until the midway point of the period and within three minute of his return hull have increase the blue lead to 2-0 deflect in miller 's crisp pas try a they might the blackhawks could n't get to joseph who stop everything they could throw at him he stop 12 shot in the second period and 13 more in the third chicago also hit the goalpost twice emerson 's goal put the game away he go hard to the net and redirect felsner 's pas"
b"yes yes i can see it now all those sabre fan finally take their sabre sweater out of the moth ball and proudly wear them after 9 year of playoff frustration and be up 3 game to nil i guess it be a pretty good bet but there have not be a team that have come back from an 0-3 deficit since 1975 could this be the year do n't throw out the moth ball yet"
b"i dunno about hat i have friend up there on genie who be now say that ottawa 's go soft on daigle and be think hard about pronger daigle have show an attitude the latter part of this season many folk havne't like and after come back from his second multi-game suspension for be stupid he 's really tanked in his performance his stock be drop like a rock also remember that a lot of teh `` draft 1st '' stuff come from the assumption he 'll be trade to quebec for lot of prospect it 's not clear that quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him give his current status he 's still first round but i do n't consider him a first pick lock by any mean at this point it 's also possible that the senator be posturing to try to bring down his signing price since daigle have be take some lindros lesson during tho suspension no kariya wo n't go in the first three for a very simple reason he 's not leave college and i do n't believe any of the expansion team be go to use a first for someone who wo n't be around for another year or two not when there be equally good or almost a good stuff available that can make an immediate impact san jose seem to be lean heavily towards niedermayer for that reason kariya could go 6th or 7th unless a team can convince him to leave school early which i doubt my cut on thing a they stand today it depends on if the shark can get a deal for him i don't believe they draft him to keep him"
b"well if shit mean go to the stanley cup final a couple year ago i 'd rather be shit than a leaf fan"

b"again i assume this be not just flame bait by roger but actually a truly held opinion thanks for speak for all those who do n't feel it be important enough to say something themselves i would n't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the view of a group that you belong to it represent a subset that you do n't belong to of a large group which you do if only because this be n't a moderate group look there be several way to state an oppose viewpoint three that come to mind be a follow 1 say it subtly result it may not be clear 2 say it directly yet politely result probably it will spark some interest conversation 3 say it directly and obnoxiously result validity go right out the window you realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be use against you"
b"well in my opinion the canuck played a really strong game i be especially pleased by a very strong game from linden i think he could be a key to success for them this year defensively they really have a strong game hardly heard selanne 's name all night craven also played one of his best game since come over with a few exception they really do n't let the high-flying jet do much high-flying i thought the jet defence look overmatched by the canuck forward they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series in short it be a great start"
b"i too think that joseph have have a great year and should be consider for the vezina i think barrasso and joseph should be the two strong candidate this year i do n't believe all of the hype that roy belfour and now potvin receive for their goaltending i do think that they be great in the net but i would rather have curtis tommy or fuhr in the net during this year playoff the big name tender always seem to have a strong defense in front of them and the goaltender get the most credit i would rather face 25 shot a game than have to rely on joseph save 35 but if the goalie be go to face 35 shot i would rather have joseph or barrasso face them -jay p go quebec and i know that mclean and several others should be mention a candidate for this year vezina but i be partial to joseph and barrasso this season"

b"i knew despite the lack of a full game telecast last week it be still too much hockey for atlanta atlanta 's abc have decline to pick up any playoff game till may9 and even when they show the game on may9 and may16 they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast i know this be still a well situation compare to rest of georgia alabama etc. but it be still pretty annoy at least in pittsburgh we have a network preemptionchannel which show all netwoork show prempted by the local affiliate i ask them what their problem be i told them that a local 1.9 rating be not that bad consider it be the first nhl game show after a long time without much promotion besides their syndicate program in the afternoon be usually low rat so what do they have to lose by show nhl playoff she told me that they have contractual obligation i ask her if golf be show oin abc would contractual obligation come in the way and how come contractual obligation do n't come in the way of last week 's telecast she then could n't give me a coherent answer also i add that atlanta have one of the high neutral site game attendance and that the demographic be good i think abc and other network should begin to tie their high rat program like roseanne in with thier sport program i hope that everyone in atlanta who read this bboard call wsb 2 and complain bitterlyt about this tell them you will stop watch their news telecast since they seem to be very unprofessional in handle this situation"

b"actually that 's base on the nhl 's history of 7 game the statstical odds of win one straight game -- 50/50 two straight game -- 25 three straight game -- 12.5 4 straight game 6.25 the odds of the penguin win 14 straight game in the playoff be 0.0061 of course this doesn't include weight average but the pen beating the devil 3 straight a weaker team along with beating the ranger 3 straight a much strong team have make the act balance out that 's about right for boston the odds of win be probably closer to 10 with weight average since buffalo 's record be n't a good and boston have a strong team enough about my qba probability though it 's just go to prove anything be possible if you integrate that to debbie gibson moog get about *** 's out of 5 for his performance from me i give blue 4 start fuhr have be too tough buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in time ... i mean after all buffalo be 3 win 7 loss in their last 10. it 's very frustrate to lose and you 've get ta say something actually it 's not about win or lose it be how you play the game but when the competition be magnify to this level 99.9 of the people only care about who win or loses i think buffalo will win in 6 -- it 's not like boston be get blown away they lose 2 ot game -- with a different bounce they could easily be up 2-1. good point here chicago 's in deep trouble tonight the 'hawks have a bad past history of win the division and lose early when they do n't finish 1st they do okay"

b"whoa what you be effectively do be imply that if a player play really well he 'stores up mistake that can be use at a later time th be not so roy be the 'villain a you so succinctly put it because he allow a very cheap goal if you think roy outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minute of the third period nhl goaltender _make_ some great save if they do not they would not be in the nhl in the first place i do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great save all of the time even though they be occasionally require however when it come to a routine shot like sakic 's especially at such a crucial time in a game i do n't think there be any legitimate excuse i be not argue that hextall be brilliant i be argue be that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal in a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there be no such thing a 'just the 1 goal i have not defend dionne for take the penalty either ... in fact i think it be a boneheaded move but it lead to _one_ goal only and montreal have a _two_ goal lead my main concern be the second goal what you say about the skater be absolutely true but realize that the game be effectively *won* you could watch any hockey game in fact you could watch any sport event period and spend hour discuss the 'what if 's w.r.t miss opportunity they be not important when the final result be decide if i get the time soon i 'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky montreal bounce and a list of quebec offensive screwup montreal be _leading_ with a minute to go the goalie be the last line of defence and i will grant that extra attention be focus on him sometimes without justification but roy give up a *lousy* goal and a team can not afford such a goal who care of what value be it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play i could do a hextall critique if you 'd like but if you 're go to ass his performance keep in mind that he make the key save at the key time for the record i do not say that roy be not one of the top goaltender in the league in fact i agree that he be i assume you be refer to me however i have point out that i think the loss can be blame on roy i have not say he suck nor do i think i've make any other 'derogatory comment if you regard objective and inform fyi observation a derogatory i really ca n't help you"
