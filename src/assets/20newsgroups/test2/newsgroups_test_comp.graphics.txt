 have anyone see hallusions you can buy a poster of them and it look like a simple dot pattern when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a 3d picture look for a program that generates these picture there  s a company in texas that make them but i doubt if give the program away any help would be appreciate there be a program include with the book    virtual reality playhouse    which will let you generate these picture not a very powerful program but it do an acceptable job for experimentation purpose

 a great many computer programmer read    dr  dobb  s journal    in a recent issue there be a paragraph in an article that pain me greatly to read it    there  s nothing wrong if microsoft set the standard for the computer industry the industry need an ibm for the 90  s    where have the hacker ethic go not the    cracker    ethic which be something entirely different and bad but the hacker ethic which tell u to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands on imperative why be it that people and corporation like bill gate ibm and intel be able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry why be it that if a person like myself post message to usenet on how to get into the little nook cranny and idiosyncrasy of a computer system they be not give any useful information by those who know just a badmouthing or be completely ignore why be it that people like steve job have to abandon their effort to make truly innovative product i ask those of you who call yourselves hacker why be this and far how can you let it go on it be a fact that the computer industry have change the world and shall continue to do so for a long time to come it have allow the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty year ago and have make this world even small than it be before i shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporation be allow to have their way perpetuate more drivel like the 286 window and the ibm product line on the computer using public that be not to say i be against business per se people who profit off of innovative intelligent creative design do not bother me in fact i applaud it that be the american way but those who manage to sell kludgy uncreative system to the public and profit off of them be the one who be the problem and unfortunately because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity they can keep do it for a very long time i put it to you thus where have the hacker ethic go if it still exists where and if it do exist why be those who call themselves    hacker    allow this to perpetuate itself why be they not create new innovative interest idea to stop the so from maintain it choke hold on the computer industry i await with interest what will probably be a resound silence

 well yeah but unlike tiff they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmap and the others be hardly trouble free i hear that it be quite common for cgm implementation not to interoperate the annoy thing about tiff be that be that along with the 50 useful option there be 100 stupid option the most egregious example be that rather than pick a byte order and bit order and use it consistently in all tiff file byte and bit order be option and all tiff reader on all machine no matter what their natural byte order have to be prepared to do byte swap there be four slightly different fax format    again any one of them would have be adequate rgb image can be store by pixel or by component complexity without function etc etc i also note that the tiff doc say that aldus experiment show that lzw reliably compress a well or well than any of the fax format suggest that none of the fax format be really useful what  s bad a lot of the format even implement very well e g  lzw limit code word to 12 bit while 14 or 16 bit would have provide substantially well compression and the lzw method compress byte rather than pixel but the absolute bad thing about tiff be that any vendor can register proprietary tiff code and format without even publicly document them this mean that there be no way to write a tiff reader that can reliably read all incoming tiff file some standard
 i be very interested in hearing from all of you who be use or implement 3 d interactive application what type of 3 d widget you would like to have in your application a 3 d widget be usually locate in the same scene a other 3 d object of the application it may let you manipulate application data the camera 3 d object in the scene and so on or view the status of the application or 3 d object via the widget  s shape color position orientation and so on or do whatever i miss but you think be possible for example a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball show a a partially transparent sphere super imposed on the object to be rotate a feedback widget can be a ruler with end anchor to 2 object the length of the ruler change a the object move and a numeric value be show on the ruler indicate the distance a widget can provide both manipulation and feedback for example the ruler can be use to change the distance between the object along it own axis please e mail me or post your opinion on 3 d interaction the information i gather will help me design a 3 d ui construction tool your help be very much appreciate

 in an attempt to do animation with pov i have create two little program one be a c program that will perform a    morph    between any two point give the amount of frame for the morph and then it will write the point and the function translate rotate etc out to a file then i have a perl script that will read the list of function and insert them into a  pov file at a give line i have hop this would let me do simple animation however i have discover that simply perform incremental rotation on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis now i know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but i know there must be another way around this i have thought perhaps it be because i have create object at the origin and then translate them to a new point and then do the rotation which could cause this behavior however this occurs on object that be not translate at all any help be appreciate

 yup most jpeg viewer seem to require specific video driver since they support only specific video card some have the standard ibm bios video support for the vga 320x200 256 colour mode but they leave out the other card such a the hercules monochrome card which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dither work right i remember the name of a jpeg viewer since i usually convert jpeg  s to gif  s before view them but some require vesa driver for the video card you need any special hardware to view jpeg  s except perhaps for a vga card and maybe a 286  processor most people these day program for 286  computer and neglect the rest of the 86 processor 8086 8088 i have a 8088 clone a nec v20 processor and a hercules card i have have to write some program so that they will view gif  s and animation for the vga and other colour graphic board on my monochrome hercules card i use floyd steinberg dither and have found that if one do something neat with the colour palette the result dither image give much great detail than it normally would when view on other monochrome system compushow 8 50 have f dither but it do the standard thing with the image palette before dither my way give a brighter more detailed image anyway enough of my ramble in the wrong direction the final point be a far a i know you need extra hardware to view jpeg  s other than the vga and perhaps a 286 or well have a day
 can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information not book too poor     regard program the standard graphic mode 320x200x4 and 640x200x2 be easy enough but not so sure about the rest something about plane or something and write to port and the like but i know the number or anything    for the 16 color mode i think if wrong let me know also 320x200x256 be just one byte pixel easy enough but be there any other way to write to the screen perhaps byte at a time or something like that of course appreciate any information about any mode     which reminds me of another question    do the supervga mode work the same generally a the normal 16 and 256 color mode or be not only the mode number for various card different but the method for write to the screen different a well thanks for any help you can give me     develop a screen class for c   and find myself search for information oh i do have ralf brown s interrupt list which have give me ton of invaluable information already it just go into the screen program detail except for the read write pixel bios call     thanks again

 look be consistent first you post something that seem to suggest that you see xv be an 8 bit program a some sort of error so i post and asy it be not a bug it be meant to be like that so you post and say it be not a bug you never say it be i have misunderstood etc now you be say if you would make up your mind what you be claim it would make the discussion a  lot  easy                         eh sorry i understand what you be say here i be aware that english be not your native language and have try hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeat me yes  as i originally said  global change be easily possible but this statement contradicts what you say earlier                      no i think so actually you be talk about load a 24 bit image into xv by quantise manipulate the colour in the colour editor then somewhow apply these change to the 24 bit file when you exit xv xv let you edit individual colour where be this sudden jumping off the topic yes i be aware there be no colourmap in a 24 bit file i do not understand what this statement be suppose to mean what be you say ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow edit of 8 bit preview of 24 bit image then i point out problem with this now you be say there be no problem because you personally happen not to use those part of the program that cause the problem not sure what you be say here certainly one can make local change yes that be one possible approach i would find a program that take such an approach clumsy however well here we agree you have not thought it through very much you seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off day perhaps you should step back and think this one through a i say in the last post jpeg be a compression algorithm it be a way of save disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem be you have not propose any workable alternative speak for yourself you be the  only  person i have met or spoken to who have quantise a 24 bit image down to 8 bit expect this process to somehow reverse when the file be save keep all modificvations that heve be make to the 8 bit image palette perhaps that be why you yused the singular look next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tell you how many colour have be allocate to the 8 bit image xv make it abundantly clear that you be not edit the original 24 bit file you be the  only  person who claim this be confuse be a design error the same a a bug read my lip xv be a program for view and modify 8 bit image it let you import other image it show i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seem to use it happily for the purpose it be design for it make no false claim if you would come up with a solid logical well argue and lucid description of precisely how these propose extension would work feel free to post them so far you have not do so argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it be so easy or alternatively look up the term import and  non reversible transformation i think this be a bit of an exageration what you be actually say be you get into a lift elevator if you be in the state and mistakenly press the down button to go up everyone else have no problem now you be try to sue the manufacturer     you bet mostly leave aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly think a you yourself admit which be the same in any language go think some more    chris lilley                                                                                                                   technical author itti computer graphic and visualisation training project computer graphic unit manchester compute centre oxford road manchester uk m13 9pl internet c c lilley mcc ac uk voice  44 0 61 275 6045 fax  44 0 61 275 6040 janet c c lilley uk ac mcc

 actually for digital hdtv system far high bandwidth than you need unless there  s some reason you must work in fully uncompressed hdtv also my calculation be that each frame should be well under 6mb even use 24 bits pixel which be more bit than you actually need 15 or 18 should be enough for a move picture 1600x1100x16bits be 3 5mb guess at hdtv resolution it may be a bit wider than 1600 fairly sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposal i hope you have a very fast memory system a well 180mb s while display will require a heavily interleave vram system unless you have a _very_ compelling reason advise try to use at least somewhat compress data you have to go to full compression to get to a level where the data io requirement be much cheaper and easy to deal with    gnu emacs be a lisp operating system disguise a a word processor doug mohney in comp arch

 edit well for starter why use rle file you might have a specific program that need them ok but i tend to convert straight to jpeg format thus a 2 4meg 24bit targa file becomes a  80k or less 24bit jpeg the late version of xv 2 2 1 and xloadimage 3 03 both handle jpeg file and the best way to convert to jpeg be with the c djpeg suit even at 90 quality you see the difference the jpeg be way small than anything else even an 8bit gif later ish craig

 hi new to image and my advisor and i would like to do some 3d reconstruction we take slide biological and image them on a 486  then the software allows u to trace the outline of the object we want to save the outline be store a a tiff file we would like to convert a group of these outline into a 3d image we be unsure a to where to begin someone mention that if we could convert the tiff into a vector format then we could view them in autocad any help would be greatly appreciate
 i heard a friend who just return from nab from la vega confirm that realsoft will be release a window version of real 3d 2 0 this summer he be told that the render speed on the dx50 a fast a a4000 however he be also told that they be switch from microsoft c   to watcom to gain more speed for people who be look for a powerful 3d animation software for pc the wait be too long real 3d 2 0 be absolutely the most powerful and flexible 3d package out there that sell for less than 1000

 ok with all the discussion about observe playback speed with quicktime the effect of scale and so on i thought do some more test first of all i felt that my original speed test be perhaps less than realistic the movie i have be use only have 18 frame in it it be a version of the very first movie i create with the compact video compressor i decide something a little longer would give closer to real world result for well or for bad i pull out a copy of    2001 a space odyssey    that i have record off tv a while back about fifteen minute into the movie there  s a sequence where the earth shuttle be approach the space station specifically i digitize a portion of about 30 second duration zoom in on the rotate space station i figure this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frame to increase the difference between frame i digitize it at only 5 frame per second to give a total of 171 frame i capture the raw footage at a resolution of 384 288 pixel with the spigot card in my centris 650 quarter size resolution from a pal source i then import it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keep the 5 fps frame rate i create two version of the movie one scale to 320 240 resolution the other at 160 120 resolution i use the default    2 00    quality set in premiere 2 0 1 and specify a key frame every ten frame i then ran the 320 240 movie through the same    raw speed test    program i use for the result be reporting earlier result a playback rate of over 45 frame per second right i be get a much high result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copy the 320 240 movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp105s and ran it from there this time the playback rate be only about 35 frame per second obviously the 230mb internal hard disk also a quantum be a significant contributor to the speed of playback i modify my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scale factor and try play back the 160 120 movie scale to 320 240 size this time the playback speed be over 60 fps clearly the poster who observe poor performance on scale playback be see quicktime 1 0 in action not 1 5  try my test with quicktime 1 0 but i think entirely compatible with my centris and system 7 1     unscaled the playback rate for the 160 120 movie be over 100 fps the other thing i try be save version of the 320 240 movie with    prefer    playback rate great than 1 0 and see how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktime  s normal synchronize playback a prefer rate of 9 0 45 fps work too well the playback be very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieve 45 fps with ease i believe that quicktime  s synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown be come from the mac system  s task switch a prefer rate of 7 0 35 fps seem to work fine i see any evidence of stutter at 8 0 40 fps i  think  i could see slight stutter but with four key frame every second it be hard to tell i guess i could try recreate the movie with a longer interval between the key frame to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more

 never claimed it be a bug never claimed it be a bug i guess i edit my note on this away from the article i post to many newsgroups i write something about make color modification quickly with 8bit quantize image and only at the save the image to file process we have to make the modification to the 24bit image this make sense because the main use of xv be only view image do many change to image we should keep all modification in a buffer and then before make the operation to 24bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operation never claimed it be a bug i try kept sure i claim that jpeg be note else than a compression algorithm because i know what the jpeg be you propably misunderstood what i write a you have do in many place so far you also miss what be be wrong with xv however i do write it
 no mi folk have infinite budget of death and they also get part of their budget allocate    upgrade       maintenance    and    new purchase    and a lot of ibm mainframe purchase be actually    lease    and so be the software basically the engineer who have tight budget i e the coder and designer of a company bitch and moan when they drop 15 000 on a sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later mi type upgrade once every 5 10 year and their cost be amortize and depreciate over a longer period and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machine for accounting payroll etc now if the budget office be dependant on the engineer for some reason like payroll and account sure a hell see every engineer with a new cray on his desktop every year
 well i have lot of experience with scan in image and alter them a for change them back into negative be that really possible stuff delete jennifer urso the oh so bitter woman of utter blahness but cheerful undertone i use aldus photostyler on the pc and i can turn a colour or black and white image into a negative or turn a negative into a colour or black and white image i know how it do it but it work well to test it i scan a negative and use aldus to create a positive it look well than the print that the film developer give me

 we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstation i be also shock when i first realize that you have to offset line from fill by about 16 bit assume 24 bit z buffer this seem huge but be only 1 256 of the dynamic range in those term it seem so bad what be happen be that the interpolation in z be not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe so the polygon be not planar in z but be more like a ruffle potato chip ditto with line when you start end at different x y value the    ridge    be out of phase result in the stitch effect you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another but with different vertex you will likely see a smear effect where they overlap example try polygon 1 100 100 100 100 200 100 200 200 100 200 100 100 polygon 2 125 125 100 125 175 100 175 175 100 175 125 100 your implementation be correct in fact we do a similar trick when render primitive that have line and polygon such a nurbs surface with isoparametric line without the trick the line appear stitch a you say when the application draw lines polygons independently the system do not have the smart to automatically do the z shift so the application must do it this be what you have discover and be do bravo note to ibm ers the information give here have be previously disclose through proper channel so not give away any new unpublished info

 molecule have evolve from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry computer graphic have played a decisive role in this transformation by allow chemist to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical object while computer scientist be conversant in the language of their own discipline they be often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation technique and practical need of research chemist similarly chemist be often unfamiliar with the late paradigm and technological advance in graphical compute this interdisciplinary course be intend to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researcher who wish to be more than just casual user of prepackaged graphic software although this be not intend to be a course in computational

 i be look for a mean to add fli and flc animation creation to a window application i be hop for something along the line of aawin or aaplay by autodesk but for the creation of these delta compress animation i have flilib but this seem to be cod for the large memory model of do with turbo c  ideally i would like a dll or medium model object library but would settle for anything really see other window apps with fli flc creation do they hack the flilib code into submission any pointer would be appreciate please send mail directly to me and i will summarize the result if there be interest
 i have be look around some ftp site and can not find one with any good gif file could someone please tell me of some ftp site which do posse good gifs and a wide range please email me at the address above thanks
 i have a group of gif image that each contain 6 small image in the same place on all the image i need a program to crop out the small image to a new gif file all the program i can find make me use the mouse or keyboard to define the crop coordinate be there a program out there for a pc that can take the crop coordinate on the command line
 i be happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an interactive full color image viewer and editor base on sgi gl besides typical touchup task such a crop rotate smooth etc bit offer some unique feature not available in similar program such a text and vector support and the separation of text and image the follow be the relevant section from the man page                                                                                                 pre release of may 1993 bit 1l name bit bitmap image touchup for sgi workstation description bit be an interactive full color image viewer and editor base on silicon graphic gl a a full color program bit handle image of both 24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner a an image viewer bit allows list of image to be displayed in their original type 24bits or color index in any order and in any of the many built in style of display you can walk up and down the list use mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the slideshow with the pan and zoom feature large image can be view in full without be limited by the window or screen size a an image editor bit performs a large number of image edit and processing task accurately and efficiently it keep information loss at any stage of the edit process at an absolute minimum by perform subpixel sample automatically while conserve the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and or quantization of input image you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily color and size text and simple geometric figure can be render on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the high printer resolution e g postscript bit can also be use a a graphical user interface to many exist image processing program by define external binding which in essence turn command line orient program into bit subfunctions and can be access by a press of a button and best of all the process image will be read back and displayed immediately convolution use exter  nally define matrix of arbitrary order can be perform dynamically give great flexibility in processing an image feature bit performs all of it image manipulation interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing be complete the process image will be displayed current feature include o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and fill the    rotate out    region with an arbitrary color o scale an image by arbitrary factor in x  and or y directions with the option of subpixel sample o render text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of render directly into the raster or save the text and raster separately such a into a postscript file to take advantage of a high printer resolution besides normal text string many predefined special symbol can be input conveniently a in tex 1 e g    alpha   small   beta produce greek alphabet alpha follow by a slightly small greek alphabet beta o present graphically the histogram of an image o performs arbitrary 1 to 1 pixel transformation the transformation function can be specify interactively and can be of arbitrary form far the transformation can be apply to rgb channel separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult task such a thresholding can be accomplish rather easily by 1 to 1 transformation in combination with the avai  lability of graphical histogram of the image o place simple geometric figure sgfs e g  arrow circle trian  gles etc  of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary location address either in absolute pixel or in some user definable coordinate system unit with the option of render directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately e g postscript file all sgfs can be scale in x  and y directions independently or simultaneously this be how to get an ellipse from a circle o performs edge detection in combination with image histogram and 1  to 1 transformation very accurate result can be obtain o performs histogram equalization o performs convolution with externally define square matrix of arbitrary order o crop a rectangular portion of an image o cut and paste across image o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount o display a list of image in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between image slideshow o measure rgb intensity of a pixel at any location or all pixel along an arbitrary line with the result present a rgb intensity or a an intensity vs  distance plot o performs image type conversion o convert image format o smoothes an image special convolution o filter an image by external program and read the filter image back and display it o modify an individual pixel  s rgb value o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the result power spectrum o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release support format o iris rgb native to sgi iris o jpeg jfif format o compuserv gif o pnm

 ask for help on a sticky problem involve unreasonably low apparent precision in z buffering that encounter in 2 different pex implementation i find any discussion of this problem in any resource i can lay hand on e g the comp windows x pex faq gaskins s _pexlib_programming_manual_ vendor documentation post this article by itself on comp graphics and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrate the problem on comp windows x pex the problem be hard to describe without picture hence this article be longish if you can run pexlib 5 x program and be interested i encourage you to build and run the test program in comp windows x pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to deal with it it depends on the utility code from the above gaskin book instruction for fetch it via anonymous ftp be give the problem to be solve be to eliminate or minimize    stitch    artifact result from the use of z buffering with polylines that be coplanar with fill area the interpolate z value along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolate z value across an area even when the endpoint of the line be coincident with vertex of the area because of this a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixel or the area pixel to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the line be suppose to be solid use the pexlib api my approach to a solution be to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entry one for the area and one for the line the pex structure or immediate  mode output must be organize so that one view table index be always in effect for area and the other be always in effect for line the result be a slight shift in npc z coordinate for the line so a to attempt to bias the tossup situation in favor of the line this shift be effect by move the front and back clip plane use in the pexlib view table entry for line just a hair    backwards    i e small vrc z coordinate compare to their position in the view table entry use for area this mean that when a point be transform to npc it z value will be slightly big if it come from a line than if it come from an area thus accomplish the desire bias i would expect the z roundoff error which cause the problem to amount to a few unit at most out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 i e 16 or 24 bit z buffers therefore it seem that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip plane ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitch but in fact experience show that the shift have to be a much a 0 003 to 0 006 of the range empirically bad when the npc z component of the slope of the surface be high i e when it appear more or less edge on to the viewer a if only 8 or 9 bit of the z buffer have any dependable meaning this amount be so great that one problem be replace by another sometimes the polylines    show through    area which they be suppose to lie behind observe the problem on both hewlett packard and digital workstation pex server to approximately the same degree the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5 x implementation this version be know to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex 5 1  open question 1 why do this happen    be i configure the pex view table wrongly    be there a systematic difference in z interpolation for line a oppose to area e g pixel center versus corner which could be correct for    be pex implementors wantonly discard z precision in their interpolators    something else 2 what to do about it    can i fix my use of the view table to allow well precision in z buffered hlhsr    be there another approach i can take to remove the stitch artifact    be i just out of luck any help would be immensely appreciate

 anyone who think that tiff be too complex dealt with cgm asn 1 cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format people seem perfectly capable deal with these others deal with the format of tiff be frankly less difficult than deal with the dct lzw and fax encode of the image data the majority of the library which deal with tiff be dedicate to these other issue rather than with simply decode the tag and parameter perhaps people be overwhelmed in comparison with some rather simpleminded format such a gif pcx and bmp but to suggest that tiff be so complex a to be doom to failure be ludicrous that mean that gif fine but even thing about use it in many instance gif be very nice for use in low end photo application and for screen grab and such but it would never do for high volume or high resolution system fax be nice but it do color and gif do b w all that well jpeg be nice for high resolution color but be slow for low end the advantage tiff brings to the table be it ability to handle all these situation and then some naturally more complex but i ld rather propose tiff image solution over image system base on have to deal with 3 4 file format anyday you may find that tiff be too complicate for your personal taste but please wrail against complexity the complexity it contains be require to provide the functionality it do and come close to the complexity found in most commercially viable file format

 concern the propose newsgroup split i personally be not in favor of do this i learn an awful lot about all aspect of graphic by reading this group from code to hardware to algorithm i just think make 5 different group out of this be a wate and will only result in a few post a week per group i kind of like the convenience of have one big forum for discuss all aspect of graphic anyone else feel this way just curious yes i also like know where to go to ask a question without get hell for put it in the wrong newsgroup i be also against splitting the group the traffic will decrease on any give subject but the require net bandwidth will increase because of multiply cross postings i just go through this with another group i continuously read it be now almost at the point where it be no longer worth reading strongly suggest not do this

 well gif stand for graphic interchange format and be put forth by compuserve back in 1987 or so it be to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system gif be limited to 8 bit color but have a built in compression scheme lzw iff be not really a graphic format but rather a standard way to package image sound animation text or whatever into one file iff be create by electronic art i do believe i could be wrong for the amiga it be quickly adopt a pretty much the standard file format for the amiga the most common image format for the iff package be an ilbm interleave bitmap but many others exist this format support 24 bit color image information on both of these and many more be available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof cs rice edu in the directory  pub graphics formats take from the faq for this news group

 i suppose you know what about we have discuss we discuss about error s in xv 2 21 which show image only a 8bit and my suggestion above work perfectly with it so far i have see a colormap edit window in xv    that be there must be a colormap anyway the problem you present be exist anyway and i try to solve them at all because i would not make such problem to my program in the first place gamma and color correction be easily do to 24bit image a i present there  s no need make trick from 8bit quantized image back to 24 bit image ok write about situation that user want edit image a 24bit and user want edit individual color    your question by the way jump off the discussion a bit my solution work because there  s no colormap withing real 24bit image    you see user see 24bit image go back to 8bit be silly about change individual color in 8bit quantized rasterized image change individual color in colormap be useless in most case if the image be quantize and rasterize    small change may make serious error to anywhere in the image xv allows this feature but i recommend to use it with the mention type image moreover xv be not a paint program you can only make those global change in full 24bit xv change individual color sound like paint program job if person have 8bit screen there  s need for trick to get the original 24bit image modify because user see full 24bit image there  s need to make approximation and it be not possible to modify individual color but individual pixel or pixel group if image be rasterize to select indiavidual color there could be 7x7 cursor window which show true color image in cursor window area    select individual color be possible from that ok i have thought very much 24bit painting program never see such in good view and be not plan to make such not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen     it save 8bit quantized rasterized image a 24bit jpegs jpeg be not design for that also human expect that 24bit will be save a 24bit image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it be expect that the image still be the same so xv be design without think about human interface and how human expect the program work    design error i have heard xv be design first for 8bit images files but it be not good idea to take full 24bit image without make major change to the original design so even all screen image be 8bit the process image and save image could have be 24bit very easily instead of 8bit before anybody will make a note yes i may a well make a lift where  up mean that the lift go down and  down mean that the lift go up and put a note on this design solution to the manual    however even the manual tell the correct situation it solve the problem american the lift be just an example well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read it

get pretty silly first off    hacker    be an obsolete term matter what it use to mean today it mean    thief    it only mean    thief    if you want it to mean that to me it mean lot of context wickedly omit by myself anyway if i say    joe be a hacker    to most english speak people who know the word probably think he be either a poor golfer or a bad carpenter but there be very very few people who will think he be a good and clever programmer if you chose to call yourself by a term that mean    thief    be surprised when people think you be a thief even if you agree with that definition of the word                    the narrower view that a hacker when associate with the compute environment be a dishonest expert be not so widespread my opinion at least with the people involve with the field imho the wider meaning be not obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to be     therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody perceives you a a thief then this person belongs to a very very small group that have some computer knowledge but not enough to know the wider and original meaning of the word     unfortunately the general public have a very narrow view of the deep dark recess of the art of compute what little they do see be from the view give to them by the medium from what i have see from the medium  hacker  be not a proper way by which to refer to a respect person i on the other hand know what  hacker mean from those who consider themselves such follow be the definition from    jargon file 2 9 10    this be also know a the    hacker dictionary    the definition be arrange in order of decrease frequency of usage hacker originally someone who make furniture with an axe n  1  a person who enjoys explore the detail of programmable system and how to stretch their capability a oppose to most user who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary 2  one who program enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoys program rather than just theorize about program 3  a person capable of appreciate hack value 4  a person who be good at program quickly 5  an expert at a particular program or one who frequently do work use it or on it a in a unix hacker definition 1 through 5 be correlate and people who fit them congregate 6  an expert or enthusiast of any kind one might be an astronomy hacker for example 7  one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcome or circumvent limitation 8 deprecate a malicious meddler who try to discover sensitive information by poke around hence  password hacker  network hacker see cracker the term  hacker also tends to connote membership in the global community define by the net see network the and internet address it also implies that the person described be see to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see hacker ethic the it be well to be described a a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way hacker consider themselves something of an elite a meritocracy base on ability though one to which new member be gladly welcome there be thus a certain ego satisfaction to be have in identify yourself a a hacker but if you claim to be one and be not quickly be label bogus see also wannabee hacker ethic the n  1  the belief that information sharing be a powerful positive good and that it be an ethical duty of hacker to share their expertise by write free software and facilitate access to information and to compute resource wherever possible 2  the belief that system cracking for fun and exploration be ethically ok a long a the cracker commits no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality both of these normative ethical principle be widely but by no mean universally accepted among hacker most hacker subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1 and many act on it by write and give away free software a few go far and assert that  all  information should be free and  any  proprietary control of it be bad this be the philosophy behind the gnu project sense 2 be more controversial some people consider the act of crack itself to be unethical like break and enter but this principle at least moderate the behavior of people who see themselves a benign cracker see also samurai on this view it be one of the high form of hackerly courtesy to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it be do and how the hole can be plug    act a an unpaid an unsolicited tiger team the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic be that almost all hacker be actively willing to share technical trick software and where possible compute resource with other hacker huge cooperative network such a usenet fidonet and internet see internet address can function without central control because of this trait they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom  s most valuable intangible asset finally a true hacker do not name himself herself one for this be a title that be bestow by the befuddle sysadmins and user at large to me a sign of a truly great hacker be to be introduce to someone who say    nahh i just know a thing or two people always exagerate        note that the above definition do not preclude a hacker from describe limself meaning himself herself one but simply say that it be well not to do so there be many who do not know the meaning of  hacker so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it be sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a know respect hacker around the workplace this mean that  hacker be define in term of some well known and respect person sometimes there may only be one such person no matter what mr  dumpty say language work that way actually it do you just have to get adequate press coverage     language work anyway that we want it to work the purpose of language be to communicate to oversimplify a long a communication be take place then language be work

 ok it be for a game that be 3d and you have list the characteristic that you be look for i think you may have left out a few important parameter the polygon be all convex they have less than n side you be draw mesh wall door etc i believe that the algorithm you can get that will only draw convex polygon can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave self intersect polygon this efficiency can largely be attribute to the fact that simple convex polygon only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure 8 type polygon can be a bit trickier the less than n side specification especially if it be a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisation to be make thus for a high speed game application i think you be look for code that exploit and be hence limited to draw simple convex polygon it may have be that they be very general purpose algorithm if you limit yourself to 3 or four side simple convex polygon i think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be

imageviewer for next this article include the follow section 1 what be jpeg 2 why use jpeg 3 when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif 4 how well do jpeg compress image 5 what be good    quality    setting for jpeg 6 where can i get jpeg software 6a    can    software viewer etc 6b source code 7 what  s all this hoopla about color quantization 8 how do jpeg work 9 what about lossless jpeg 10 why all the argument about file format 11 how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it 12 what about arithmetic cod 13 do loss accumulate with repeat compression decompression 14 what be some rule of thumb for convert gif image to jpeg section 1 6 be basic info that every jpeg user need to know section 7 14 be advanced info for the curious this article be post

address to reply to                1 what be jpeg jpeg pronounce    jay peg    be a standardize image compression mechanism jpeg stand for joint photographic expert group the original name of the committee that write the standard jpeg be design for compress either full color or gray scale digital image of    natural    real world scene it do not work so well on non realistic image such a cartoon or line drawing jpeg do not handle black and white 1 bit per pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg be    lossy    meaning that the image you get out of decompression quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of it compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail perceive a well a small detail of light and dark thus jpeg be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine analyze your image the small error introduce by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg be that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjust compression parameter this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make  extremely  small file if you mind poor quality this be useful for index image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you happy with the output quality at the default compression set you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept lesser compression 2 why use jpeg there be two good reason to make your image file small and to store 24 bit per pixel color data instead of 8 bit per pixel data make image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archive library of image be able to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare gif and jpeg the size ratio be more like four to one more detail below if your view software support jpeg directly have to convert jpeg to some other format for view or manipulate image even with a jpeg capable viewer it take longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus use jpeg be essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a shorter file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file i  ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif a a standard usenet post format be that jpeg can store full color information 24 bits pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or few color if you have only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though 8 bit gif will look a obsolete a black and white macpaint format do today furthermore for reason detailed in section 7 jpeg be far more useful than gif for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware hence jpeg be considerably more appropriate than gif for use a a usenet post standard 3 when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg be  not  go to displace gif entirely for some type of image gif be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about jpeg be which kind of image to apply it to a a rule of thumb jpeg be superior to gif for store full color or gray scale image of    realistic    scene that mean scan photograph and similar material jpeg be superior even if you have 24 bit display hardware and it be a lot superior if you do see section 7 for detail gif do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such a cartoon and line drawing in particular large area of pixel that be all  exactly  the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg squeeze these file a much a gif do without introduce visible defect this sort of image be best kept in gif form in particular single color border be quite cheap in gif file but they should be avoid in jpeg file jpeg also have a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure black pixel adjacent to a row of pure white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blur unless you use a very high quality set again this sort of thing be not found in scan photograph but it show up fairly often in gif file border overlaid text etc the blurriness be particularly objectionable with text only a few pixel high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text jpeg it computer drawn image ray traced scene for instance usually fall between scan image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same go for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such plain black and white two level image should never be convert to jpeg you need at least about 16 gray level before jpeg be useful for gray scale image it should also be note that gif be lossless for gray scale image of up to 256 level while jpeg be not if you have an exist library of gif image you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argues that jpeg image quality be superior to gif only applies if both format start from a full color original if you start from a gif already irretrievably lose a great deal of information jpeg can only make thing bad however the disk space saving may justify convert anyway this be a decision have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 14 for hint be prepared to leave some image in gif format since some gifs will not convert well 4 how well do jpeg compress image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image i have handy a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purpose the rest be create with the free jpeg software described in section 6b file size in byte comment ship ppm 1145040 original file in ppm format no compression 24 bit or 3 byte per pixel plus a few byte overhead ship ppm z 963829 ppm file pass through unix compress compress accomplish a lot note other text oriented compressor give similar result ship gif 240438 convert to gif with ppmquant  fs 256 ppmtogif most of the saving be the result of lose color info gif save 8 bits pixel not 24 see sec 7 ship jpg95 155622 cjpeg  q 95 high useful quality set this be indistinguishable from the 24 bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeball ship jpg75 58009 cjpeg  q 75 default set you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg50 38406 cjpeg  q 50 this have slight defect if you know what to look for you could tell be jpeged without see the original still a good image quality a many recent posting in usenet picture group ship jpg25 25192 cjpeg  q 25 jpeg  s characteristic    blockiness    becomes apparent at this set djpeg  blocksmooth help some still see plenty of usenet posting that be of poorer image quality than this ship jpg5o 6587 cjpeg  q 5  optimize  optimize cut table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or index purpose note that this file be tiny the compression ratio from the original be 173 1 in this case jpeg can make a file a factor of four or five small than a gif of comparable quality the  q 75 file be every bit a good a the gif well if you have a full color display this seem to be a typical ratio for real world scene 5 what be good    quality    setting for jpeg most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs  image quality tradeoff by select a quality set there seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting    quality 95    do not mean    keep 95 of the information    a some have claimed the quality scale be purely arbitrary not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use jpeg be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this set will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality set  q 75 be very often the best choice this set be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try  q 75 first if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above  q 95 say  q 100 will produce a file two or three time a large a  q 95 but of hardly any well quality if the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to  q 50 without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a high quality set to avoid far degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gifs to jpeg the default  q 75 be about right for compress 24 bit image but  q 85 to 95 be usually well for convert gifs see section 14 for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or index purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a  q set in the range of 5 to 10 be about right  q 2 or so may be amuse a    op art    note the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such a image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program even provide a numeric scale just    high       medium       low     style choice 6 where can i get jpeg software most of the program described in this section be available by ftp if you know how to use ftp see the faq article    how to find source    if you have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in news answers or you can get it by send e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with    send usenet news answers finding sources    in the body the    anonymous ftp list faq    may also be helpful    usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late jpeg faq from the news answers archive 6a if you be look for    can    software viewer etc the first part of this list be system specific program that only run on one kind of system if you see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over internet but some commercial program be list too x window xv shareware 25 be an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image format it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulation available for ftp from export lcs mit edu 18 24 0 12 file contrib xv 3 00 tar z version 3 00 be a major upgrade with support for 24 bit display and many other improvement however it be brand new and still have some bug lurk if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 2 21 also available from export note that version 2 21 be not a good choice if you have a 24 bit display get only 8 bit color nor for convert 24 bit image to jpeg but 2 21 work fine for convert gif and other 8 bit image to jpeg caution there be a glitch in version 2 21 be sure to check the    save at normal size    checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x window be john cristy  s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handle many image processing and conversion task the imagemagick viewer handle 24 bit display correctly for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support jpeg in it late release 3 03  xloadimage be free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage 3 03 tar z xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it have the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3 03 be use a hacked over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli 1 14 tar z both program be say to do the right thing with 24 bit display ms dos this cover plain do for window or os 2 program see the next heading one good choice be eric praetzel  s free dvpeg which view jpeg and gif file the current version 2 5 be available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca 129 97 50 50 file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg25 zip this be a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386 486 machine the user interface be not flashy but functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer be mohammad rezaei  s hiview the current version 1 2 be available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos graphics hv12 zip hiview require a 386 or well cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work window and os 2 do not hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen for large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning scrolling a most viewer do you may or may not prefer this approach but there  s no deny that it slows down load of large image considerably note installation be a bit tricky read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be colorview for do 30 this be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative it user interface be also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use    more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be faster than dvpeg but a little slow than hiview at least on my hardware for image large than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both be faster than hiview the current version be 2 1 available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos graphics dcview21 zip require a vesa graphic driver if you have one look in vesadrv2 zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pc have a built in vesa driver so try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver be miss a second shareware alternative be fullview which have be kick around the net for a while but i know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway the author tell me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the simtel20 archive at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow support jpeg in it late revision 8 60a however cshow  s jpeg implementation very good slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi color display too bad     it  d have be nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware 25 available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos gif cshw860a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic hardware any one of these viewer might not work on your particular machine if you get  any  of them to work need to use one of the follow conversion program to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware use gif a the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic5 0 be repute to do the right thing with hi color display the independent jpeg group  s free jpeg converter be ftpable from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos graphics jpeg4 zip or jpeg4386 zip if you have a 386 and extend memory these file be do compilation of the free source code described in section 6b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm format handmade software offer free jpeg gif conversion tool gif2jpg jpg2gif these be slow and be limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you get 24 bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tool be that they will read and write hsi  s proprietary jpeg format a well a the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format file be rather widespread on bbs this be a useful capability version 2 0 of these tool be free prior version be shareware get it from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos graphics gif2jpg2 zip note do not use hsi format for file to be post on internet since it be not readable on non pc platform handmade software also have a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate

rather slow ftp transfer rate from simtel20 there be several internet site that maintain copy mirror of the simtel20 archive most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead a popular usa mirror site be oak oakland edu 141 210 10 117 which keep simtel20 file in eg     pub msdos graphics    if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve file from simtel20 by e mail see informational posting in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you be outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your near simtel20 mirror be microsoft window there be several window program capable of display jpeg image window viewer be generally slow than do viewer on the same hardware due to window system overhead note that you can run the do conversion program described above inside a window do window the new entry be winecj which be free and extremely fast version 1 0 be available from ftp rahul net file  pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip require window 3 1 and 256 or more colors mode this be a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality be noticeably bad than other viewer but so fast use it anyway at least for preview     jview be freeware fairly fast have good on line help and can write out the decompress image in window bmp format but it create new jpeg file and it view gifs jview also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer such a brightness adjustment but an excellent basic viewer the current version 0 9 be available from ftp cica indiana edu 129 79 20 84 file pub pc win3 desktop

interface be very well thought out gifconverter a shareware 40 image viewer converter support jfif and pict jpeg a well a gif and several other image format the late version be 2 3 2  get it from sumex aim stanford edu file  info mac art gif gif converter 232 hqx require system 6 0 5 or later gifconverter be not well than jpegview a a plain jpeg gif viewer but it have much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth it shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image also the new version of gifconverter can load and save jfif image  without  quicktime so it be your best bet if your machine be too old to run quicktime but faster with quicktime note if gifconverter run out of memory try to load a large jpeg try convert the file to gif with jpeg convert then view the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utility be available from sumex aim stanford edu file  info mac app jpeg convert 10 hqx this will run on any mac but it only do file conversion not view you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous version of this faq recommend imagery jpeg v0 6 a jpeg gif converter base on an old version of the ijg code if you be use this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple  s free program pictpixie can view image in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these format you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt 1 0 stuff pictpixie hqx require quicktime pictpixie be intend a a developer  s tool and really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of it drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface bad pictpixie be an unsupported program meaning it have some minor bug that apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of pictpixie call pictcompressor float around the net if you have this you should trash it a even buggier also the quicktime starter kit include a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie call picture compressor note that picture compressor be not free and may not be distribute on the net storm technology  s picture decompress be a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without system 7 or quicktime so you may be force to use it on old system it do need 32 bit quickdraw so really old machine use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file  info mac app picture decompress 201 hqx you must set the file type of a download image file to  jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine be too old to run 32 bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter be your only choice for single program jpeg view if you want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac application be support jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version 2 0 1 or later can read and write jfif format jpeg file use the jpeg plug in from the

pointer appreciate acorn archimedes changefsi supply with risc o 3 version 3 10 can convert from and view jpeg jfif format provision be also make to convert image to jpeg although this must be do from the cli rather than by double clicking recent version since 7 11 of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg along with about 30 other image format while old version can be found on some archimedes bboards the current version be only available by register with the author john kortink nutterbrink 31 7544 wj enschede the netherlands price 35 dutch guilder about 22 or 10 pound there  s also a commercial product call jpeg which provide jpeg read write functionality and direct jpeg view a well a a host of other image format conversion and processing option this be more expensive but not necessarily well than the above program contact dt software freepost cambridge uk tel 0223 841099  next imageviewer be a pd utility that display image and can do some format conversion the current version read jpeg but do not write it imageviewer be available from the standard next archive at sonata cc purdue edu and cs orst edu somewhere in  pub next both be currently be re organized so hard to point to specific sub directories note that there be an old version float around that do not support jpeg portable software for almost any system if none of the above fit your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 6b also need a viewer program if your display be 8 bit or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 24 bit image file there be numerous commercial jpeg offering with more pop up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask point question about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the early commercial release be not and never will be compatible with anyone else  s file 6b if you be look for source code to

independent jpeg group be a volunteer organization if like to contribute to improve our software you be welcome to join 7 what  s all this hoopla about color quantization most people have full color 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 or few bit per pixel so it can display 256 or few distinct color at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color this process be call    color quantization    this be something of a misnomer    color selection    would be a well term stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy process it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by jpeg except at the very low jpeg quality setting since jpeg be a full color format convert a color jpeg image for display on 8 bit or less hardware require color quantization this be true for  all  color jpegs even if you feed a 256 or less color gif into jpeg what come out of the decompressor be  not  256 color but thousand of color this happens because jpeg  s lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get    smear    into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be always require to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a jpeg image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference i occasionally see post image described a    256 color jpeg    this tell me that the poster a read this faq and b probably convert the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classify a color or gray scale just like photograph but number of color just a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition have already be quantize to 256 or few color a gif  does  have a definite number of color in it palette and the format allow more than 256 palette entry for purpose of usenet picture distribution gif have the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipient have to this be also the  disadvantage  of gif stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re quantize result in much poorer image quality than if you have quantize once from a full color image furthermore if the sender use a high quality color quantization algorithm out of luck for this reason jpeg offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine match the sender  s display hardware jpeg  s full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user  s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of jpeg image you already have with a gif stuck forevermore with what be sent also worth mention that many gif viewing program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a 256 color gif on a 16 color ega display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to this be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the gif one to display it but often also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be displayed thus jpeg be likely to provide well result than the average gif program for low color resolution display a well a high resolution one finally an ever growing number of people have better than 8 bit display hardware already 15 bit    hi color    pc display true 24 bit display on workstation and macintosh etc for these people gif be already obsolete a it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thus jpeg be an all around well choice than gif for represent image in a machine independent fashion 8 how do jpeg work the buzz words to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy cod this article  s long enough already so not go to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this be available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in file  pub usenet news answers compression faq part 1 3 if you need help in use the news answers archive see the top of this article 9 what about lossless jpeg there  s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e  one that guarantee the final output be bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offer much less compression at present very few implementation of lossless jpeg exist and all of them be commercial say     q 100    to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossless image what it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say     sample 1x1    to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular jpeg algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image at this minimum loss set regular jpeg produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit for bit accuracy if you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than 6 bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs well than jpeg lossless on such image jpeg lossless be superior to jbig on image with 6 or more bit per pixel furthermore jpeg be public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig technique be heavily cover by patent 10 why all the argument about file format strictly speak jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithm it do  not  refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaf u with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to    do their own thing    and a a result their program compatible with anybody else  s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format be some work be coordinate by people at c cube microsystems they have define two jpeg based file format jfif jpeg file interchange format a    low end    format that transport pixel and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff 6 0 an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff be a    high end    format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff be a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of tiff not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these format be developed with input from all the major vendor of jpeg related product reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard i believe that usenet should adopt jfif a the replacement for gif in picture posting jfif be simpler than tiff and be available now the tiff 6 0 spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when tiff jpeg be well define the jfif format be likely to be a widely support    low common denominator    tiff jpeg file may never be a transportable a particular case that people may be interested in be apple  s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime us a jfif compatible format wrap inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg be pretty straightforward and several mac program be available to do it see mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for detail another particular case be handmade software  s program gif2jpg jpg2gif and image alchemy these program be capable of reading and write jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format be not readable by any non hsi program and should not be use for usenet posting use the  j switch to get jfif output this applies to old version of these program the current release emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format file unless you want to get flame by people on non pc platform 11 how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an allege jpeg file that your software read likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file 1  a jfif standard file will start with the character hex ff d8 ff e0 follow by two variable byte often hex 00 10 follow by  jfif 2  if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a    raw jpeg    file this be probably decodable as is by jfif software    worth a try anyway 3  hsi file start with  hsi1 out of luck unless you have hsi software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they decompress properly with non hsi program 4  a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a jfif header scan for  jfif strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it 5  anything else a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8 try strip off everything before that in uuencoded usenet posting the characteristic jfif pattern be    begin    line m_ c_x     whereas uuencoded hsi file will start with    begin    line m   i     if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non jfif file 12 what about arithmetic cod the jpeg spec defines two different    back end    module for the final output of compress data either huffman cod or arithmetic cod be allow the choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic cod usually produce a small compress file on typical image arithmetic cod produce a file 5 or 10 percent small than huffman cod all the file size number previously cite be for huffman cod unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic cod specify by the jpeg standard be subject to patent own by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus  you can not legally use arithmetic coding  unless you obtain license from these company the    fair use    doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic cod the space saving great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic cod  should not  be use for any image to be exchange on usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for far detail 13 do loss accumulate with repeat compression decompression it would be nice if have compress an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any far image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately this be not the case in general recompressing an alter image loses more information though usually not a much a be lose the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it  without change it  then there be no far loss i e  you get an identical jpeg file even this be not true at least not with the current free jpeg software essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on our to do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limited but i be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compress the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality set would introduce no far loss even such simple change a crop off a border could cause far roundoff error degradation if wonder why because the pixel block boundary move if you cropped off only multiple of 16 pixel you might be safe but a mighty limited capability the bottom line be that jpeg be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you want to use it a an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way 14 what be some rule of thumb for convert gif image to jpeg a state earlier you  will  lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif be make from far well to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality the first rule when convert a gif library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary some gifs may be well left a gifs a explain in section 3 in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or few color convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be  larger  than the gif so check the size too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs be the best candidate for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to jpeg with least degradation waste your time convert any gif much under 100 kbytes also expect jpeg file convert from gifs to be a small a those create directly from full color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be a much a twice a big a straight through jpeg file would be i e  shoot for 1 2 or 1 3rd the size of the gif file not 1 4th a suggest in earlier comparison many people have developed an odd habit of put a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in gif file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact    ghost    edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you be on an x window system xv  s manual and automatic crop function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg  s default q set of 75 be appropriate for full color input but for gif input q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smooth a suggest below the high q set may not be necessary color gifs of photograph or complex artwork be usually    dither    to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different color at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to jpeg it look like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you have it to get around this you want to    smooth    the gif image before compression smooth average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process get rid of the rapid color change that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smooth will often let you avoid use a high q factor thus far reduce the size of the compress file while still obtain a better looking output image than get without smooth with the v4 free jpeg software or product base on it a simple smooth capability be built in try     smooth 10    or so when convert gifs value of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dither may require large smooth factor if you can see regular fine scale pattern on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smooth be definitely call for too large a smooth factor will blur the output image which you want if you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filter program such a pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg  s built in smoother be a lot faster than pnmconvol     the upshot of all this be that    cjpeg  quality 85  smooth 10    be probably a good start point for convert gifs but if you really care about the image want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting                               for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg

 howdy all hmm     48 bit aye well it beat a 32 bit design for thee sake of ellegance 48 bit mean 16 bit per primary colour the 2 48 nr of colour be a bit mislead it make more sense to see it a 65536 possible shade of pure red this might actually make some sense since 256 shade of red 24 bit colour may produce visible  jumps in intensity then again a byte per primary colour for each pixel be the most elegant way of do colour graphic because it leaf ya such a tidy and fast program code take care bram
 i have a little question i need to convert rgb coded red green blue color into hvs coded hue value saturnation color do anyone know which formula to use thanks

gif image to jpeg section 1 6 be basic info that every jpeg user need to know section 7 14 be advanced info for the curious this article be post every 2 week you can always find the late version in

separate line if you get a reply the server may be misread your return address add a line such a    path myname mysite    to specify your correct e mail address to reply to                1 what be jpeg jpeg pronounce    jay peg    be a standardize image compression mechanism jpeg stand for joint photographic expert group the original name of the committee that write the standard jpeg be design for compress either full color or gray scale digital image of    natural    real world scene it do not work so well on non realistic image such a cartoon or line drawing jpeg do not handle black and white 1 bit per pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg be    lossy    meaning that the image you get out of decompression quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of it compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail perceive a well a small detail of light and dark thus jpeg be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine analyze your image the small error introduce by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg be that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjust compression parameter this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make  extremely  small file if you mind poor quality this be useful for index image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you happy with the output quality at the default compression set you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept lesser compression 2 why use jpeg there be two good reason to make your image file small and to store 24 bit per pixel color data instead of 8 bit per pixel data make image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archive library of image be able to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare gif and jpeg the size ratio be more like four to one more detail below if your view software support jpeg directly have to convert jpeg to some other format for view or manipulate image even with a jpeg capable viewer it take longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus use jpeg be essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a shorter file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file i  ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif a a standard usenet post format be that jpeg can store full color information 24 bits pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or few color if you have only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though 8 bit gif will look a obsolete a black and white macpaint format do today furthermore for reason detailed in section 7 jpeg be far more useful than gif for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware hence jpeg be considerably more appropriate than gif for use a a usenet post standard 3 when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg be  not  go to displace gif entirely for some type of image gif be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about jpeg be which kind of image to apply it to a a rule of thumb jpeg be superior to gif for store full color or gray scale image of    realistic    scene that mean scan photograph and similar material jpeg be superior even if you have 24 bit display hardware and it be a lot superior if you do see section 7 for detail gif do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such a cartoon and line drawing in particular large area of pixel that be all  exactly  the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg squeeze these file a much a gif do without introduce visible defect this sort of image be best kept in gif form in particular single color border be quite cheap in gif file but they should be avoid in jpeg file jpeg also have a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure black pixel adjacent to a row of pure white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blur unless you use a very high quality set again this sort of thing be not found in scan photograph but it show up fairly often in gif file border overlaid text etc the blurriness be particularly objectionable with text only a few pixel high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text jpeg it computer drawn image ray traced scene for instance usually fall between scan image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same go for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such plain black and white two level image should never be convert to jpeg you need at least about 16 gray level before jpeg be useful for gray scale image it should also be note that gif be lossless for gray scale image of up to 256 level while jpeg be not if you have an exist library of gif image you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argues that jpeg image quality be superior to gif only applies if both format start from a full color original if you start from a gif already irretrievably lose a great deal of information jpeg can only make thing bad however the disk space saving may justify convert anyway this be a decision have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 14 for hint be prepared to leave some image in gif format since some gifs will not convert well 4 how well do jpeg compress image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image i have handy a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purpose the rest be create with the free jpeg software described in section 6b file size in byte comment ship ppm 1145040 original file in ppm format no compression 24 bit or 3 byte per pixel plus a few byte overhead ship ppm z 963829 ppm file pass through unix compress compress accomplish a lot note other text oriented compressor give similar result ship gif 240438 convert to gif with ppmquant  fs 256 ppmtogif most of the saving be the result of lose color info gif save 8 bits pixel not 24 see sec 7 ship jpg95 155622 cjpeg  q 95 high useful quality set this be indistinguishable from the 24 bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeball ship jpg75 58009 cjpeg  q 75 default set you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg50 38406 cjpeg  q 50 this have slight defect if you know what to look for you could tell be jpeged without see the original still a good image quality a many recent posting in usenet picture group ship jpg25 25192 cjpeg  q 25 jpeg  s characteristic    blockiness    becomes apparent at this set djpeg  blocksmooth help some still see plenty of usenet posting that be of poorer image quality than this ship jpg5o 6587 cjpeg  q 5  optimize  optimize cut table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or index purpose note that this file be tiny the compression ratio from the original be 173 1 in this case jpeg can make a file a factor of four or five small than a gif of comparable quality the  q 75 file be every bit a good a the gif well if you have a full color display this seem to be a typical ratio for real world scene 5 what be good    quality    setting for jpeg most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs  image quality tradeoff by select a quality set there seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting    quality 95    do not mean    keep 95 of the information    a some have claimed the quality scale be purely arbitrary not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use jpeg be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this set will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality set  q 75 be very often the best choice this set be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try  q 75 first if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above  q 95 say  q 100 will produce a file two or three time a large a  q 95 but of hardly any well quality if the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to  q 50 without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a high quality set to avoid far degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gifs to jpeg the default  q 75 be about right for compress 24 bit image but  q 85 to 95 be usually well for convert gifs see section 14 for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or index purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a  q set in the range of 5 to 10 be about right  q 2 or so may be amuse a    op art    note the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such a image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program even provide a numeric scale just    high       medium       low     style choice 6 where can i get jpeg software most of the program described in this section be available by ftp if you know how to use ftp see the faq article    how to find source    if you have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in news answers or you can get it by send e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with    send usenet news answers finding sources    in the body the    anonymous ftp list faq    may also be helpful    usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late jpeg faq from the news answers archive 6a if you be look for    can    software viewer etc the first part of this list be system specific program that only run on one kind of system if you see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over internet but some commercial program be list too x window xv shareware 25 be an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image format it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulation available for ftp from export lcs mit edu 18 24 0 12 file contrib xv 3 00 tar z version 3 00 be a major upgrade with support for 24 bit display and many other improvement however it be brand new and still have some bug lurk if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 2 21 also available from export note that version 2 21 be not a good choice if you have a 24 bit display get only 8 bit color nor for convert 24 bit image to jpeg but 2 21 work fine for convert gif and other 8 bit image to jpeg caution there be a glitch in version 2 21 be sure to check the    save at normal size    checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x window be john cristy  s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handle many image processing and conversion task the imagemagick viewer handle 24 bit display correctly for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support jpeg in it late release 3 03  xloadimage be free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage 3 03 tar z xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it have the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3 03 be use a hacked over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli 1 14 tar z both program be say to do the right thing with 24 bit display ms dos this cover plain do for window or os 2 program see the next heading one good choice be eric praetzel  s free dvpeg which view jpeg and gif file the current version 2 5 be available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca 129 97 50 50 file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg25 zip this be a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386 486 machine the user interface be not flashy but functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer be mohammad rezaei  s hiview the current version 1 2 be available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos graphics hv12 zip hiview require a 386 or well cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work window and os 2 do not hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen for large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning scrolling a most viewer do you may or may not prefer this approach but there  s no deny that it slows down load of large image considerably note installation be a bit tricky read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be colorview for do 30 this be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative it user interface be also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use    more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be faster than dvpeg but a little slow than hiview at least on my hardware for image large than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both be faster than hiview the current version be 2 1 available from

choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of it drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface bad pictpixie be an unsupported program meaning it have some minor bug that apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of pictpixie call pictcompressor float around the net if you have this you should trash it a even buggier also the quicktime starter kit include a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie call picture compressor note

24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 or few bit per pixel so it can display 256 or few distinct color at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color this process be call    color quantization    this be something of a misnomer    color selection    would be a well term stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy process it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by jpeg except at the very low jpeg quality setting since jpeg be a full color format convert a color jpeg image for display on 8 bit or less hardware require color quantization this be true for  all  color jpegs even if you feed a 256 or less color gif into jpeg what come out of the decompressor be  not  256 color but thousand of color this happens because jpeg  s lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get    smear    into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be always require to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a jpeg image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference i occasionally see post image described a    256 color jpeg    this tell me that the poster a read this faq and b probably convert the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classify a color or gray scale just like photograph but number of color just a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition have already be quantize to 256 or few color a gif  does  have a definite number of color in it palette and the format allow more than 256 palette entry for purpose of usenet picture distribution gif have the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipient have to this be also the  disadvantage  of gif stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re quantize result in much poorer image quality than if you have quantize once from a full color image furthermore if the sender use a high quality color quantization algorithm out of luck for this reason jpeg offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine match the sender  s display hardware jpeg  s full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user  s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of jpeg image you already have with a gif stuck forevermore with what be sent also worth mention that many gif viewing program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a 256 color gif on a 16 color ega display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to this be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the gif one to display it but often also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be displayed thus jpeg be likely to provide well result than the average gif program for low color resolution display a well a high resolution one finally an ever growing number of people have better than 8 bit display hardware already 15 bit    hi color    pc display true 24 bit display on workstation and macintosh etc for these people gif be already obsolete a it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thus jpeg be an all around well choice than gif for represent image in a machine independent fashion 8 how do jpeg work the buzz words to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy cod this article  s long enough already so not go to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this be available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in file  pub usenet news answers compression faq part 1 3 if you need help in use the news answers archive see the top of this article 9 what about lossless jpeg there  s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e  one that guarantee the final output be bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offer much less compression at present very few implementation of lossless jpeg exist and all of them be commercial say     q 100    to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossless image what it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say     sample 1x1    to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular jpeg algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image at this minimum loss set regular jpeg produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit for bit accuracy if you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than 6 bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs well than jpeg lossless on such image jpeg lossless be superior to jbig on image with 6 or more bit per pixel furthermore jpeg be public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig technique be heavily cover by patent 10 why all the argument about file format strictly speak jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithm it do  not  refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaf u with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to    do their own thing    and a a result their program compatible with anybody else  s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format be some work be coordinate by people at c cube microsystems they have define two jpeg based file format jfif jpeg file interchange format a    low end    format that transport pixel and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff 6 0 an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff be a    high end    format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff be a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of tiff not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these format be developed with input from all the major vendor of jpeg related product reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard i believe that usenet should adopt jfif a the replacement for gif in picture posting jfif be simpler than tiff and be available now the tiff 6 0 spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when tiff jpeg be well define the jfif format be likely to be a widely support    low common denominator    tiff jpeg file may never be a transportable a particular case that people may be interested in be apple  s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime us a jfif compatible format wrap inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg be pretty straightforward and several mac program be available to do it see mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for detail another particular case be handmade software  s program gif2jpg jpg2gif and image alchemy these program be capable of reading and write jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format be not readable by any non hsi program and should not be use for usenet posting use the  j switch to get jfif output this applies to old version of these program the current release emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format file unless you want to get flame by people on non pc platform 11 how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an allege jpeg file that your software read likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file 1  a jfif standard file will start with the character hex ff d8 ff e0 follow by two variable byte often hex 00 10 follow by  jfif 2  if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a    raw jpeg    file this be probably decodable as is by jfif software    worth a try anyway 3  hsi file start with  hsi1 out of luck unless you have hsi software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they decompress properly with non hsi program 4  a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a jfif header scan for  jfif strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it 5  anything else a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8 try strip off everything before that in uuencoded usenet posting the characteristic jfif pattern be    begin    line m_ c_x     whereas uuencoded hsi file will start with    begin    line m   i     if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non jfif file 12 what about arithmetic cod the jpeg spec defines two different    back end    module for the final output of compress data either huffman cod or arithmetic cod be allow the choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic cod usually produce a small compress file on typical image arithmetic cod produce a file 5 or 10 percent small than huffman cod all the file size number previously cite be for huffman cod unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic cod specify by the jpeg standard be subject to patent own by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus  you can not legally use arithmetic coding  unless you obtain license from these company the    fair use    doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic cod the space saving great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic cod  should not  be use for any image to be exchange on usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for far detail 13 do loss accumulate with repeat compression decompression it would be nice if have compress an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any far image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately this be not the case in general recompressing an alter image loses more information though usually not a much a be lose the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it  without change it  then there be no far loss i e  you get an identical jpeg file even this be not true at least not with the current free jpeg software essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on our to do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limited but i be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compress the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality set would introduce no far loss even such simple change a crop off a border could cause far roundoff error degradation if wonder why because the pixel block boundary move if you cropped off only multiple of 16 pixel you might be safe but a mighty limited capability the bottom line be that jpeg be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you want to use it a an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way 14 what be some rule of thumb for convert gif image to jpeg a state earlier you  will  lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif be make from far well to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality the first rule when convert a gif library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary some gifs may be well left a gifs a explain in section 3 in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or few color convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be  larger  than the gif so check the size too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs be the best candidate for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to jpeg with least degradation waste your time convert any gif much under 100 kbytes also expect jpeg file convert from gifs to be a small a those create directly from full color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be a much a twice a big a straight through jpeg file would be i e  shoot for 1 2 or 1 3rd the size of the gif file not 1 4th a suggest in earlier comparison many people have developed an odd habit of put a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in gif file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact    ghost    edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you be on an x window system xv  s manual and automatic crop function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg  s default q set of 75 be appropriate for full color input but for gif input q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smooth a suggest below the high q set may not be necessary color gifs of photograph or complex artwork be usually    dither    to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different color at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to jpeg it look like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you have it to get around this you want to    smooth    the gif image before compression smooth average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process get rid of the rapid color change that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smooth will often let you avoid use a high q factor thus far reduce the size of the compress file while still obtain a better looking output image than get without smooth with the v4 free jpeg software or product base on it a simple smooth capability be built in try     smooth 10    or so when convert gifs value of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dither may require large smooth factor if you can see regular fine scale pattern on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smooth be definitely call for too large a smooth factor will blur the output image which you want if you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filter program such a pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg  s built in smoother be a lot faster than pnmconvol     the upshot of all this be that    cjpeg  quality 85  smooth 10    be probably a good start point for convert gifs but if you really care about the image want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting                               for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg

 liefting the alt hierarchie be create for 2 purpose 1  for liefting group which do not fit under the comp or other  official  liefting hierarchy 2  for the fast creation of hot new newsgroups liefting like alt gulf war liefting because there be no voting process or any other control liefting facility site be free to decide not to carry some of liefting the alt group liefting therefore it be i think desirable to try to create liefting comp graphics raytrace render or whatever and not an liefting alt group plus  many  site especially many  com site do not carry any alt newsgroups we for example a comp group will get a much broader distribution and would be useful to many more people plus the topic be important popular enough to warrant it own group imho

 also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphic library package to do pc vga graphic currently work on a realtime application run on a pcc with a non dos kernel that need to do some simple graphic not sure if reentrancy of the graphic library be go to be an issue or not i suspect i  ll implement the display controller a a server process that handle graphic request queue on a mailbox one at a time if this provide sufficiently frequent display update then i believe that i can restrict all graphic operation to be perform by the server and thus constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphic library be fairly new to the realtime system world i may be overlook something what do you think
 hello i have post to this newsgroup once before and recieved a moderately helpful response on a couple of issue this i appreciate very much i would however like to know why it be that ther be simply no information out there on some subject for the relativly novice graphic programmer the subject be 1 how do you access the extra video memory on a video board i know somwhere there aresome standard video bios call that allow you to dothis i have 1meg of memory on my board and accord to all the book and info i have read i be only at maximum use 256k of it there be a way to do this in standard vga cause i have see vidoe page write in assembly which i know write into apps hat use mode 13h to get any speed at all you have to do this how do i do it 2 the vesa standard what give here i have read most of what the net have to offer on vesa and a far a cod for vesa go most of the advice be cryptic at best where do i get public domain info that will tell me in    mostly plain    english how the vesa call work my big gripe be about number 1  i have bought graphic book i have ask graphic professor i have hunt the net through both gopher and archie i ahave ask apps programmer and it be like there be some lock on this information graphic program book tell alot of programmiing algorithm information but they always fall short of tell you how to really control the video bios what be all the call folk i know there be people out there that know how to doall ti stuff where be you and why you write a book yet please help thanks in advance
 find a disk array that can do 180mb sec will be difficult the fast one i know about be from maximum strategy ibm also sell these they can attach hippi at up to 144 mb sec 64 bit for these kind of data rate you need more than scsi for connection their late model the raid 5 model gen 4 only do 90 mb sec but i think this may be a limitation only of the hippi channel and that customer need have not exceed that speed since their old model be faster they be also not idle must be work on newer product that might be faster and be a small company so you might be able to ask about custom interface they still market the old faster model a of a few mongths ago maximum strategy inc  801 buckeye court milpitas ca 95035 7408 sale maxstrat com you might still want to look into compression a it will be very difficult to keep the hippi bus fully work at all time sustain throughput might come close to maximum burst rate interest problem tell u more if you can

 the first and only thing ever try to auto trace be a piece of a uscg nautical chart use adobe illustrator 3 2  i want to get the outline of the coast for western long island sound i be simultaneously suprised at how good a job it do and disappointed at how poorly it do i suspect what i give it be a very difficult thing not only be the coastline very irregular but overlaid on the chart be numerous set of gridlines not only lattitude and longitude but loran grid a well the most common mistake it make be whenever the coastline be roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line it would take off follow the gridline instead of the coast i think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say    no dummy go the wrong way    steve reisberg a friend of mine a few year back do his doctoral work analyse electron micrographs of filimentous phage virii a good chunk of the work be write a program to take a digitize micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particle this be essentially the same problem that illustrator try to solve with it auto trace tool in some respect the problem steve work on be harder since he be try to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and find a good centerline be only the first step but a step on which all future analysis depend however in other respect it be an easy problem since the program could be write with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particle be suppose to look like and the analysis could be restrict to those particle which happend to be relatively straight clean and well image you always have that freedom auto tracing real life image in any case it give me some insight into just how difficult this problem be to solve in the general case steve be no longer with u he and his wife disappear while on vacation in hawaii a couple of year after they graduate their last know location be hike in a densely wooded in a mountainous area while no body be ever found they be presume to have be the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the wood

 there be some trick to instal atm to window     install them first to do then run the atm control panel to get them into window the best reason for atm be that adobe be the standard truetype be a fail m venture to undercut adobe when adobe be be nasty about keep their format proprietary just about any service bureau or print shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a truetype document to them for high resolution printing or rip although there be lot of pretty tt font float around they be really for dot matrix or your own lazer printer however you can convert your tt font with fontmonger or some similar program to atm font for high end stuff if you be use dot matrix for all your printing you may have waste your money
 hi netters do a project which be about image analysis firstly i have to find out any restriction or limitation on the colour display on various kind of workstation they be decstation hp amiga apollo secondly i read from some graphic text that image be displayed in 24 bite please point out to me if i get it wrong but the image which i will deal with be displayed in 16 bite by the software they be use currently so will there be any problem to display them under x windows in the future because we be think to implement the gui by x windows for our project be there any person here can help me to solve the problem or query above or give me some advice or suggestion where i can find them out please send me an e mail if there be any thanks in advance yours christine chan
 i think the main reason be that in the good old hacker day of the young er gate and job of the world the computer be not a widespread a phenomenom a it be now with the increase popularity of the pc come a plethora of mundane business us which require more practical mind and narrower focused programmer why be a hacker when you can get a good job program database or program for accountant basically the yuppie caught up and discipline the hacker and mold them in their own image

 look for algorithm or article on virtual sound what i want to do be the follow from a fast source eg a cdrom several sound source be read each have own define position and other attribute eg direction etc give the listener position and direction the sum of sound played back in each of the listener earphone will be a function of this position and direction this mean that some simulation of the ear color of sound relative to incoming direction have to be do for each sound source i think this be possible to do with a lookup table of impulse response for several angle relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from this for a give angle this impulse function could then be convolute with the sound from the source this impulse function must be change every time some sound source change position or the listener change orientation additionally some reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich be define could be simulated but this require some sort of sound propagandation simulation kinda like some radiosity algorithm have someone do this and or write article on implement such a system please post or mail any answer or comment    torgeir veimo study at the university of bergen        gona wave my freak flag high    jimi hendrix

 i get regular question about gamma correction since i go to great pain to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program i maintain here be an explanation i often use to answer these question this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq graeme gill    a note on gamma correction and image    author graeme w  gill graeme labtam oz au date 93 5 16    what be all this gamma stuff anyway                                                             although it would be nice to think that    an image be an image    there be a lot of complication not only be there a whole bunch of different image format gif jpeg tiff etc etc there be a whole lot of other technical stuff that make deal with image a bit complicate gamma be one of those thing if ever download image from bb or the net probably notice with most image view program that some image look ok some look too dark and some look too light    why be this    you may ask this be gamma correction or the lack of it why do we need gamma correction at all                                                          gamma correction be need because of the nature of crt cathode ray tube the monitor usually use for view image if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measure the amount of light come from each point of the scene then you have create a    linear    or un gamma corrected image this be a good thing in many way because you can manipulate the image a if the value in the image file be light ie add and multiply will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt you find that the crt __ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light come from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this light_out voltage crt_gamma so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to    gamma correct    the image first you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image so that thing cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image gamma_corrected_image image 1 crt_gamma for most crt the crt_gamma be somewhere between 1 0 and 3 0  if that be all it be why do it seem so complicate                                                                               the problem be that not all display program do gamma correction also not all source of image give you linear image video camera or video signal in general because of this a lot of image already have some gamma correction do to them and you be rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those image with a program that do gamma correction for you the image get correct twice and look way to light if you display one of those image with a program that do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction be not exactly right for you particular crt whose fault be all this                                  it be really three thing one be all those display program out there that do gamma correction properly another be that most image format specify a standard gamma or have some way or record what their gamma correction be the third thing be that not many people understand what gamma correction be all about and create a lot of image with vary gamma  s at least two file format do the right thing the utah graphic toolkit  rle format have a semi standard way of record the gamma of an image the jfif file standard that us jpeg compression specifies that the image to be encode must have a gamma of 1 0 ie a linear image but not everyone obeys the rule some image loader for instance xli an x11 image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you be use but the individual gamma value of image you be try to view other image viewer eg xv another x11 image program and utility eg the pbm toolkit provide way of change the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allow for undo any gamma correction the image have and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor note that xv 2 21 provide an easy way of modify the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curve to the appropriate gamma in the coledit control alter the intensity in the hsv control do the right thing a it fails to take account of the effect gamma have on h and s  this tends to give a tint to the image how can i figure out what my viewer do or what gamma my screen have                                                                                                       the simplest way to do that be to try load the file chkgamma jpg provide with xli distribution which be a jfif jpeg format file contain two grayscale ramp the ramp be chosen to look linear to the human eye one use continuous tone and the other use dither if your viewer do the right thing and gamma corrects image then the two ramp should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it help if you move away a little from the screen and de focus your eye a bit if your viewer do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center if your viewer do have a way of set the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point be above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it be below the center the value will usually be around 2 2 with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the  dispgamma flag and once get it right you can set the display_gamma environment variable in your  profile how do i figure out what the gamma of an image be                                                                         this be the most tricky bit a a general rule it seem that a lot of true color ie 24 bit  ppm  jpg image have a gamma of 1 0 linear although there be many about that have some gamma correction it seem that the majority of pseudo color image ie 8 bit image with color map  gif etc be gamma correct to some degree or other if your viewer do gamma correction then linear image will look good and gamma correct image will look too light if your viewer do gamma correction then linear image will look too dark and gamma correct image will ok  why linear image be sometimes not such a good thing                                                                               one of the reason that many high quality format such a video use gamma correction be that it actually make well use of the storage medium this be because the human eye have a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction have a similar compression characteristic this mean image could make well use of 8 bit per color for instance if they use gamma correction the implication though be that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bit to retain the same accuracy since little popular software do this and none of the popular image format can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it be difficult to justify gamma correct image at the popular level if some image format can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software take care to use extra precision when deal with linearize internal data then gamma correct distribution of image would be a good thing i be told that the kodak photocd format for instance have a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the high quality out of the bit use to hold the image
 hi we have an old montage fr 1 35mm film recorder when connect to a pc with it processor card it can directly take hpgl targa and lasergraphics language file 24 bit targa be quite ok for raster image but conversion from whatever one happens to have can be quite slow this lasergraphics language seem to be get the source file for one test image a vector based language that can handle one million color it do some polygon too and perhaps something else the question be where can i find some information about this language a ftp site a book a company address     ok it would be nice to have a window driver for it but not that optimistic     thanks in advance for any help jussi

 well 48 bit colour  could  be for improve resolution but 16 bit per channel seem like a bit excessive i have see a paper that quote 10 bit per channel of 12 bit for computational precision more than that would seem to be waste perhaps the frame buffer us another colourspace which need more bit to represent the full range rgb be a cube so it be a compact encode most likely however be that there be two separate 24 bit 8 bit per component frame buffer this set up call double buffering allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer contain the previous frame be displayed this make for smoother animation well hey if you want to brag about number the 5000 range can take a pxg turbo  card with 96 bit per pixel full double buffering two 24 bit buffer a 24 bit z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage mind you the card cost more than your workstation    chris lilley                                                                                                                   technical author itti computer graphic and visualisation training project computer graphic unit manchester compute centre oxford road manchester uk m13 9pl internet c c lilley mcc ac uk voice  44 0 61 275 6045 fax  44 0 61 275 6040 janet c c lilley uk ac mcc

should be free those be the general purpose package heard of besides what terramar have sip _was_ write for aviris imagery not sure how general purpose it be you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that do pc and walsh transformation with pseudocoloring and cluster and limited image modification you can compute an image use select component use it on 70 megabyte aviris image without problem but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large image take quite a while 50 70 time a long to process a freebie if you want it       my favorite be idl interactive data language from research system inc  idl be in my opinion much well and infinitely easy it program language be very strong and easy    very pascal like it handle the number crunching very well also personally i like do the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if not too hairy then bring it over to nih image for the image part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination handle and the speed and ease of use compare to iraf be incredible by the way mostly astronomical image processing which be do this mean image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional image processing routine then for example take a graph of intensity versus position

engineering research lab cerl it be a popular geographic and remote sense image processing package many may think of grass a a geographic information system rather than an image processing package although it be report to have significant image processing capability feature description i use grass because public domain and can be obtain through the internet for free grass run in unix and be write in c  the source code can be obtain through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass integration you then compile the source code for your machine use script provide with grass i would recommend grass for someone who already have a workstation and be on a limited budget grass be not very user friendly compare to macintosh software    a first review of overview documentation indicates that it look useful and have some pixel resampling function not in other package plus good general purpose image enhancement routine fft kelly maurice at vexcel corp  in boulder co be a

requirement if you be willing to run a ux you could install grass on a macintosh which have significant image analysis and import capability for satellite data grass be public domain and can run on a

band image or create color image by combine various individual band etc the package be design for a remote sense application it can handle very large image and there be all kind of other software available for gi application host configuration requirement it run on intergraph workstation a unix machine similar to a sun though there be rumor there be always rumor that the software would be port to pc and possibly a sun environment pci    a company call pci inc  out of richmond hill ontario canada make an array of software utility for processing manipulation and use of remote sense data in eight or ten different    industry standard    format lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose title i forget the software be available in version for ms dos unix workstation among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platform by now i use the vms version the    pci software    consists of several classes groups packages of utility grouped by function but all operating on a common    pci database    disk file the    tape i o    package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote sensing industry tape format into or write those format out from the    pci database    file this be the only package i use or know much about other package can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attach printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphic printer you might be more spe  cifically interested in the mathematical operation package histo  gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operation e g    multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store a channel 5    and god only know what all else    there  s a lot i have and use these so say much about them you only buy the package your particular application interest call for each utility be control by from one to eight    parameter    read from a common    parameter file    which must be in vms anyway in your    default directory    some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confuse set up a series of operation the standard pci environment contains a script language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common complicate lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in vms i can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional program library which allows you to write compile language program which can interface with read from write to the pci data structure database file parameter file the pci software be design specifically for remote sensing image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing a well for instance the tape i o package offer a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh call    raw    data from tape in a number of different    interleave    order this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic arts industry  s    ct2t    format would probably i try handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you  re do or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over worth note that the pci    database    file be design to contain not only    raster    image data but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral band latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pas all of this can go into the pci    database    i _believe_ that on workstation the built in display be use on vax system other than workstation pci support only a couple of specific third party display system the name gould deanza seem to come to mind one of my personal workarounds be a display program which would display directly from a pci    database    file to a peritek vct q q bus 24 bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be    overkill    in your case it seem design for the very    high end    applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely suffice although a you know the gap be get small all the time probably no coincidence that pci be locate in canada a country which do a lot of it land resource management via remote sense i believe the canadian government us pci software for some of it work in these area spam spectral analysis manager                                                 back in 1985 jpl developed something call spam spectral analysis manager which get a fair amount of use at

 think about what you be say here the 24 bit image be quantise down to 8 bit so many  similar colour be mapped onto a single palette colour this colour get modify in fairly arbitrary way you then want to apply these modification back to the 24 bit file so you have to find which colour mapped to this one palette colour ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and use the extra 8 bit to hold the index entry have do this you need to do something to them     what exactly apply the difference in rgb between the original and modify palette entry to each colour in the group this could generate colour with rgb outside the range 0     255  it would also lead to discontinuity when different part of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entry you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depend how far each colour be from the palette entry however i suspect this would look rather odd so in summary what i say in my previous post still hold in other word to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job tack mod onto xv be go to create more problem than it solves a to the other bit you seem to be claim that there be bug in xv if that be not what you meant then yes i probably do i found that the collect digest format of your post make it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point be sorry if i misunderstood yes again what  is  be wrong with xv    chris lilley                                                                                                                   technical author itti computer graphic and visualisation training project computer graphic unit manchester compute centre oxford road manchester uk m13 9pl internet c c lilley mcc ac uk voice  44 0 61 275 6045 fax  44 0 61 275 6040 janet c c lilley uk ac mcc

but wrong method be to loop over the pixel in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this be wrong because it leaf hole in the destination instead loop over the pixel in the destination image apply the  reverse  transformation to the coordinate and copy that pixel from the source this method be quite general and can be use for any one to one 2 d mapping

someone mail this to me    there be a number of automate mail server that will send you thing like this in response to a message see item 13 below for detail on some also the newsgroup alt graphics

other thing a well there be a regular monthly fit basic and information post on sci astro fits read it if you want to know more 9 convert between vector format a lot of people ask about convert from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever it be important to understand that this be a very different problem from the image format conversion in item 7  convert one image format to another be a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel be a pixel    the basic object be the same for all image format this be not so for vector format the basic object    circle ellipsis drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangle etc    vary from one format to another except in extremely restrict case it be simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector format there be software for convert to and from cgm file on ftp psc edu the contributor state that it run on unix ms windows and possibly the mac a well more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it be quite possible to do a close approximation render an image from one format use the primitive from another a far a i know no one have put together a general toolkit of such converter but two different hpgl to postscript converter have be post to comp sources misc check the index on your near archive site a related frequent question be how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x11 bitmap for example some of the commercial postscript clone for pc  s allow you to render to a disk file a well a a printer also the postscript interpreter in the next box and in sun  s x11 news can be use to render to a file if clever but in general the answer be no however if someone be to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit add a vector to raster converter would be trivial gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version 2 5 2 include driver for both ppm and gif format file thus it can be use a a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter it implement essentially all of postscript level 1 and alot of display postscript and level 2 10 how to get pixar film the various john lasseter pixar

11 how do i draw a circle a a bezier or b spline curve the short answer be    you    unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle the approximation may look acceptable but it be sensitive to scale magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies deviation from circularity that be not visible in the small can become glare in the large if you want to do the job right consult the article    a menagerie of rational b spline circle    by leslie piegl and wayne tiller in ieee computer graphic and application volume 9 number 9 september 1989 page 48 56  for rough non

 yes here  s what you should do keep the vertex in an array and have the polygon triangle be okay but n sided polygon be slightly more efficient store the index into the array of the vertex that comprise them you set a flag for each vertex when you transform it so you have to transform any vertex more than once you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon so that vertex that belong only to bacfacing polys have to be transform at all whenever you transform a vertex check if on the far side of the hither plane if it be you can project it right away and store the result then do your z clip any vertex that get produce will have to have their projection do at that stage

 first of all this be not a snide response if confuse about this issue you will stumble over a lot of other thing a well i suggest that the weakness be your reference material get    an introduction to ray trace    by andrew glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm you could also refer to the 2nd edition of foley van dam on to the question the simple answer be that you just keep add up all the contribution and then clamp at the maximum intensity for example if your intensity value range from 0 0 to 1 0 then keep add up and clamp the resultant value to 1 0 you might have to clamp the low bound to 0 0 if you have dark bulb but another issue    so you get some illumination equation like this i lambient ldiffuse light n lreflected ltransparent the contribution due to reflection be just sum with the light intensity a be the light due to transparency now a slightly less hand waving illumination equation be this i kala kdld light n krlr ktlt that be each component of the illumination equation be govern by the material constant ka kd kr and kt so the maximum you can get from transparency for a give object for example might be 0 4 0 1 0 5 for a purple colored glass object hopefully this answer your question i  ll forward my    illumination equation sermon    to you also
