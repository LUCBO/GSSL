b"yesterday i go to the boeing shareholder meeting it be a bit shorter than i expect last year when the stock be first down they make a big presentation on the 777 and other program this year it be much more bare-bones in any case i want to ask a question that the board of director would hear and so i get there early and figure that if i do n't get to the mike maybe they would read mine off of a card and so i write it down and hand it in after the meeting start mr. shrontz say that he would only answer write question in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only have monitor downstairs naturally i be crush so when question and answer time come i be suprised to find my question be read and answer admittedly near the end of the one that he take presumably get there early and get the question in early make all the difference so on to the substance the question be be boeing look at anything beyond the high speed civil transport such a a commercial space launch system and if not how will boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently be developed by mcdonnell douglas well he read it without a hitch and without edit with impressed me then he answer it very quickly treat it a a two part question last part first this be to the best of my recollection what he say a far a single stage to orbit technology we think that we have a well answer in a two stage approach and we be talk to some of our customer about that a far a commercialization that be a long way off the high speed civil transport be about a far out a our commercial planning go at this point so this tell me that boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena and for the most part this be true however it also tell me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launcher for them to persue work on their own now i do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing actually this be a mis-nomer a there be no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy be do however he be do work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contract he wo n't tell me what he be do but maybe this be where the tsto action be take place at boeing at the very minimum the chairman of the board of boeing say that they have an approach in mind and they be try to do something with it anybody know anything far be this really news do this threaten far work on dc-"

basic property of matter '' 1988 most book and journal article on the subject of astrophysics be bristling with integral partial differential and other fancy mathematics in this book by contrast mathematics be conspicuous by it absence except for some relatively simple formula imbed in the text larson emphasizes concept and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory do not guarantee it conceptual validity dewey b. larson be a retire engineer with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed the theory described in his book while try to find a way to mathematically calculate the property of chemical compound base only on the element they contain `` the universe of motion '' describes the astrophysical portion of larson 's consistent integrate comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe a kind of `` grand unified field theory '' that orthodox physicist and astro-physicists claim to be look for it be built on two postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe be compose entirely of one component motion exist in three dimension in discrete unit and with two reciprocal aspect space and time 2 the physical universe conforms to the relation of ordinary commutative mathematics it primary magnitude be absolute and it geometry be euclidean from these two postulate larson be able to build a complete theoretical universe from photon and subatomic particle to the giant elliptical galaxy by combine the concept of inward and outward scalar motion with translational vibrational rotational and rotational- vibrational motion at each step in the development he be able to match part of his theoretical universe with correspond part in the real physical universe include even thing not yet discover for example in his 1959 book he first predict the existence of explode galaxy several year before astronomer start find them they be a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory and when quasar be discover he have a related explanation ready for those also a a result of his theory which he call `` the reciprocal system '' larson totally reject many of the sacred doctrine of orthodox physicist and astrophysicist include black hole neutron star degenerate matter quantum wave mechanic a apply to atomic structure `` nuclear '' physic general relativity relativistic mass increase relativistic doppler shift nuclear fusion in star and the big bang all of which he consider to be nothing more than mathematical fantasy he be very critical of the ad hoc assumption uncertainty principle solution in principle `` no other way '' declaration etc. use to maintain them `` the universe of motion '' be divide into 31 chapter it begin with a description of how galaxy be built from the gravitational attraction between globular star cluster which be form from intergalactic gas and dust cloud that accumulate from the decay product of cosmic ray come in from the anti-matter half of the physical universe galaxy formation from the mythical `` big bang '' be a big mystery to orthodox astronomer he then go on to describe life cycle of star and how binary and multiple star system and solar system result from type i supernova explosion of single star several chapter be devote to quasar which accord to larson be densely-packed cluster of star that have be eject from the central bulge of explode galaxy and be actually travel faster than the speed of light although most of that speed be away from u in time astronomer and astrophysicist who run up against observation that contradict their theory would find larson 's explanation quite valuable if consider with an open mind for example they use to believe that gamma ray burst originate from pulsar which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observe that the burst come from all direction uniformly and do not correspond with any visible object except for a few case of directional coincidence larson 's explanation be that the gamma ray burst originate from supernova explosion in the anti-matter half of the physical universe which larson call the `` cosmic sector '' because the anti-matter universe exists in a reciprocal relation to our material universe with the speed of light a the boundary between them and have three dimension of time and only one dimension of space the burst can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly at random larson heavily quote or paraphrase statement

the book `` astronomy the cosmic journey '' by william k. hartmann say `` our hope of understand all star would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple star form ... unfortunately

b"i ca n't see the need for a single big expensive heavy `` mothership '' except for voyager style flyby mission a few year ago i do some calculation on a '' grand tour '' space probe launch by a saturn v in 1975-76. at the time i felt that the idea of a big `` mother ship '' have some merit the voyager have to be rather small lightweight craft due to the limitation impose by use weak titan iii/centaur launcher the concept i examine and michael 's have a lot in common with the british interplanetary society 's daedalus project for send a probe to barnard 's star i.e a large `` bus '' spacecraft carry several small probe to be dispatch when the ship arrives at it destination the saturn v supposedly would have be able to launch a 10-ton payload towards jupiter and beyond the `` bus '' could have include far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the voyager a there would be no limitation on weight anymore extremely important a the voyager have to perform most of their measurement within a couple of week before and after planetary encounter and usually at a relatively great distance -- the small probe carry aboard might have be base on the `` real '' voyager and an even small version like the one schedule for launch towards pluto in the early 21st century and would have be release at various point during the mission the advantage be obvious the bus would have carry out the same basic jupiter-saturn-uranus-neptune mission than voyager 2 do but in addition two `` sub-probes '' could have be relased at saturn examine that planet 's south polar region before move on to pluto this would have enable nasa to map both hemisphere of pluto/charon by 1986 ... and several other probe could have examine part of the jupiter/saturn/uranus/neptune system that be n't examine in great detail by the voyager due to trajectory-related factor a small `` swarm '' of camera-equipped miniature space probe release a month before encounter would have be too costly for a small voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launch from a heavy well-equipped spacecraft and would we have learn a lot more about the outer planet the reason why the grand tour be cancel be lack of money of course marcu"

from orbit to accomplish this task the basic venera design be modify in numerous area the central bus core be make one meter 39.37 inch longer to carry the two ton of propellant require for brake into orbit double the fuel carry by the venera 9 and 10 orbiter eight year earlier extra solar panel be add on to give the vehicle more power for handle the large amount of data which would be create by

6-meter 4.62 by 19.8-foot 300-kilogram 660-pound polyus v side-looking radar antenna the radar system possibly a terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellite use by the soviet for earth ocean surveillance would be able to map venus' surface at a resolution of one to two kilometer 0.62 to 1.2 mile the soviet probe image parameter be a vast improvement over the united state pioneer venus orbiter which could reveal object no small than 75 kilometer 45 mile in diameter and while the veneras resolution be comparable to that of similar observation make by the 300-meter 1,000-foot arecibo radio telescope on the island of puerto rico the orbiter would be examine the northern pole of venus this region be unobtainable by either arecibo or pioneer venus and appear to contain a

venera 15 fire it brake rocket over venus to place itself in a polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometer 600 by 39,000 mile around the planet complete one revolution every twenty-four hour venera 16 follow suit four day later the twin probe thus become venus first polar-circling spacecraft radar operation begin on october 16 for venera 15 and october 20 for venera 16. for up to sixteen minute every orbit over the north pole the probe would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometer ninety mile wide and nine thousand kilometer 5,400 mile long the craft would then head out to the high part of their orbit over the south pole to recharge their battery and transmit the data back to two large soviet antenna on earth each strip of information take eight hour to process by computer by the end of their main mission in july of 1984 the veneras have mapped 115 million square kilometer 46 million square mile thirty percent of the entire planet venera 15 and 16 reveal that venus have a surface geology more complex than show by pioneer venus in the late 1970s numerous hill mountain ridge valley and plain spread across the landscape many of them apparently form by lava from erupt volcano in the last one billion year in planetary term this make the venerean surface rather young hundred of crater be detect a well the large of which have to have be create by meteorite planetoid would be a well term here at least fourteen kilometer 8.4 mile across due to venus very dense atmosphere there be some disagreement between u.s. and soviet scientist on the origin of certain surface feature for example the probe owner declare that the 96-kilometer 57.6-mile wide crater at the summit of 10,800-meter 35,640-foot high maxwell monte the tallest mountain on the planet be the result of a meteorite impact american scientist on the other hand felt the crater be proof that maxwell be a huge volcano sit on the northern `` continent '' of ishtar terra in any event the u.s. decide to wait on make verdict about venus until the arrival of their own radar probe schedule for later in the decade originally name the venus orbit image radar voir it initial design be scale back and the craft be redesig- nated the venus radar mapper vrm eventually the machine would be call magellan after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan circa 1480-1521 this vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the veneras for the time however the soviet probe maintain that distinction radar image be not the only ability of the veneras bolt next to the polyus v radar antenna be the omega altimeter and the fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measure the world's temperature the majority of the area cover register about five hundred degree celsius 932 degree fahrenheit but a few location be two hundred degree hotter possibly indicate current volcanic activity the probe also found that the cloud over the pole be five to eight kilometer three to 4.8 mile low than at the equator in contrast the polar air above sixty kilometer thirty-six mile altitude be five to twenty degree warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar height when the main mapping mission end in july of 1984 there be plan for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at more southernly latitude unfortunately this idea do not come to pas a the orbiter may not have possess enough attitude-control gas to perform the operation venera 15 and 16 cease transmission in march of 1985 leave the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six hundred kilometer 360 mile of radar data tape to sort into an atlas of twenty-seven map of the northern hemisphere of venus venus by balloon for year the thick atmosphere of venus have be a tempt target to scientist who wish to explore the planet 's mantle of air with balloon-borne instrument professor jacques blamont of the french space agency centre national d'etudes spatiales cnes have propose such an idea a far back a 1967 only to have a joint french-soviet balloon mission cancel in 1982. nevertheless late in the year 1984 such dream would eventually come true when two proton rocket be sent skyward on december 15 and 21 the soviet union provide western observer with the first clear full view of the booster which have be launch every soviet venus probe since 1975. this be but one of many first for the complex mission the unmanned probe launch into space that december be name vega 1 and 2 a contraction of the word venera and gallei gallei be the russian word for halley not only do the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform they also have more than one celestial objective to explore namely the comet halley this famous periodic traveler be make it late return to the inner region of the solar system since it last visit in 1910. since it be widely believe that comet be the icy remains from the formation of the solar system five billion year ago scientist around the world give high priority to explore one of the few such body which actually come close to earth most comet linger in the cold and dark outer fringe of the solar system some like halley be perturbed by various force and fall in towards the sun where they circle for millennium spew out ice and debris for million of kilometer from the warmth of each solar encounter the soviet union along with the european space agency esa and japan 's institute of space and astronautical science isas do not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of halley the esa would be use the cylindrical giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet while japan 's first deep space craft sakigake pioneer and suisei comet would view halley from a much safer distance scientist in the united state also desire to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe at one time envision a vessel power by solar sail or ion engine however government budget cut to nasa cancel the american effort the u.s. would have to make do primarily with earth-based observation and the share of data from other nation though an instrument name the dust counter and mass analyzer ducma design by chicago university professor john simpson be add on the soviet mission in may of 1984. the soviet answer to halley be the vega instead of building an entirely new craft for the mission the soviet decide to modify their venera bus design to encounter the comet while perform an advanced venus mission along the way a vega 1 and 2 reach venus the bus would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of the shroud planet to swing them towards comet halley much a the u.s. probe mariner 10 use venus to flyby mercury eleven year earlier the soviet craft would then head on to halley help to pinpoint the location of the comet 's erupt nucleus for the giotto probe to dive in only 605 kilometer 363 mile away in march of 1986. a plan the two vega arrive at venus in june of 1985. vega 1 release it payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander make a two-day descent towards the planet the craft touch the upper atmosphere on the morning of june 11. sixty-one kilometer 36.6 mile above the venerean surface a small container be release by the lander which produce a parachute at 55 kilometer 33 mile altitude thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus have successfully arrive one kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas be pumped into the teflon-coated plastic balloon inflate it to a diameter of 3.54 meter 11.68 foot dangle on a tether thirteen meter 42.9 foot below be the instrument package properly know a an aerostat the top part of the 6.9-kilogram 15.18-pound aerostat consist of a cone which serve a an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon beneath it be the transmitter electronics and instrument connect at the bottom be a nephelometer for measure cloud particle the aerostat be paint with a special white finish to keep at bay the corrode mist of sulfuric acid which permeate the planet 's atmosphere the vega 1 balloon be drop into the night side of venus just north of the equator scientist be concerned that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight so they place it in the darken hemisphere to give the craft a much time a possible to return data this action necessitate that the lander come down in the dark a well effectively remove the camera system use on previous mission the author wonder though if they could have use floodlight similar to the one attach to venera 9 and 10 in 1975 when soviet scientist have thought the planet 's surface be enshroud in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover the first balloon transmit for 46.5 hour right into the day hemisphere before it lithium battery fail cover 11,600 kilometer 6,960 mile the threat of bursting in the day heat do not materialize the vega 1 balloon be station at a 54-kilometer 32.4-mile altitude after drop ballast at fifty kilometer thirty mile for this be consider the most active of the three main cloud layer report by pioneer venus in 1978. indeed the balloon be push across the planet at speed up to 250 kilometer 150 mile per hour strong vertical wind bobbed the craft up and down two to three hundred meter 660 to 990 foot through most of the journey the layer 's air temperature average forty degree celsius 104 degree fahrenheit and pressure be a mere 0.5 earth atmosphere the nephelometer could find no clear region in the surround cloud early in the first balloon 's flight the vega 1 lander be already head towards the venerean surface both lander be equip with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the one carry on venera 13 and 14 in 1982. however vega 1 would become unable to report the composition of the ground at it land site in rusalka planitia the mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra while still ten to fifteen minute away from land a timer malfunction cause the drill to accidentally begin it programmed activity sixteen kilometer 9.6 mile above the surface there be neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after land this be unfortunate not only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of venus be cover with such smooth low-level lava plain and have never before be directly examine nevertheless the surface temperature and pressure be calculate at 468 degree celsius 874.4 degree fahrenheit and 95 earth atmosphere respectively during the lander 's 56 minute of ground transmission a large amount of background infrared radiation be also record at the site a have be do when the drill and camera on venera 11 and 12 have fail in december of 1978 the soviet focus on the data return during the lander 's plunge through the atmosphere the french-soviet malachite mass spectrometer detect sulfur chlorine and possibly phosphorus it be the sulfur possibly from active volcano which give the venerean cloud their yellowish color the sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometer 28.8 and 37.8 mile contain one milligram 0.015 grain of sulfuric acid the vega 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud deck appear to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus the case be make even strong by the fact that vega 2 's result nearly match it twin the vega found only two main cloud layer instead of the three report by the u.s. probe the layer be three to five kilometer 1.8 to 3 mile thick at altitude of 50 and 58 kilometer 30 and 34.8 mile the cloud persist like a thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometer 21 mile much low than the pv reading one possibility for the discrepan- cies may have be radical structural change in the venerean air over the last seven year when the lander and balloon finally go silent the last function part of the vega 1 mission the flyby bus sail on for a 708 million-kilometer 424.8 million-mile journey around the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley on march 6 1986 the bus make a 8,890-kilometer 5,334-mile pas at the dark and icy visitor before travel on in interplanetary space the soviet have accomplish their first mission to two celestial body with one space vessel on june 13 vega 2 release it lander/balloon payload for a two-day fall towards venus like it duplicate the vega 2 balloon radioed information back to the twenty antenna track it on earth for 46.5 hour before battery failure on the morning side of the planet during it 11,100-kilometer 6,660-mile flight over venus the second balloon enter in a rather still environment which become less so twenty hour into the mission after 33 hour mission time the air become even more turbulent for a far eight hour when the balloon pass over a five- kilometer three-mile mountain on the `` continent '' of aphrodite terra a powerful downdraft pull the craft 2.5 kilometer 1.5 mile towards the surface temperature sensor on the vega 2 balloon report that the air layer it be move through be consistently 6.5 degree celsius 43.7 degree fahrenheit cooler than the area explore by the vega 1 balloon this be corroborate by the vega 2 lander a it pass through the balloon 's level no positive indication of lightning be make by either balloon and the second aerostat 's nephelometer fail to function the vega 2 lander touch down on the northern edge of aphrodite terra 's western arm on the fifteenth of june 1,500 kilometer 900 mile southeast of vega 1. the lander 's rest place be smoother than thought indicate either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one cover in fresh lava the soil drill be in work order and report a rock type know a anorthosite-troctolite rare on earth but present in luna 's highland this rock be rich in aluminum and silicon but lack in iron and magnesium a high degree of sulfur be also present in the soil the air around vega 2 measure 463 degree celsius 865.4 degree fahrenheit and 91 earth atmosphere essentially a typical day or night on venus far above the vega 2 lander it carrier bus speed past venus at a distance of 24,500 kilometer 14,700 mile and follow it twin to comet halley make a closer flyby on march 9 1986 at just 8,030 kilometer 4,818 mile both probe help to reveal that the comet be a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometer 8.4 mile across rotate once every 53 hour give or take three hour since both vega craft be still function after their halley encounter soviet scientist consider an option to send the probe to other celestial object one prime target be the near- earth planetoid 2101 adonis which vega 2 could pas at a distance of six million kilometer 3.6 million mile sadly the soviet have to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it be discover that there be not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis a plan vega 1 and 2 be quietly shut down in early 1987. future plan divert the impressive vega mission have give some scientist numerous idea and hope for even more ambitious expedition to the second world from the sun one example be the vesta mission plan for the early 1990s this soviet-french collaboration call for the launch of multiple probe on a single proton rocket in either 1991 or 1992. the craft would first swing by venus and drop off several lander and balloon probe the aerostats would be design to survive in the planet 's corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over the vega balloon two day the mission would then head out to investigate several planetoid and comet include a possible land on vesta thus the mission name the most reflective main belt planetoid a see from earth unfortunately for venus exploration plan begin to change in the soviet union in 1986 the soviet decide to reroute the vesta mission to the red planet mar instead of venus keep the comet and planetoid aspect intact by this time in the soviet space program interest be focus on mar already under construction be an entirely new probe design call phobos two member of this class be plan to leave earth in 1988 and orbit mar the next year phobos 1 and 2 would then place the first instrument on mar large moon phobos all this be a prelude to even more advanced mar expedition include balloon probe rover soil sample return craft and eventually human explorer in the early twenty-first century the environment of venus be just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future but thing begin to look bleak for soviet venus and mar exploration both phobos probe fail to complete their mission one lose contact on the way to the red planet in 1988 and the other go silent in mar orbit just one week before the plan moon land in march of 1989. in 1989 a plan be devise for a venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrator around the planet in 1998. several year later the mission launch date be move to the year 2005 and have now be put on indefinite hold no other official soviet mission to venus have since be put forth a sad commentary after twenty-five year of continuous robotic exploration of the planet during the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change be take over the soviet union president mikhail gorbachev begin to `` open up '' his nation to the benefit of increase cooperation with the rest of the nation particularly those in the west while the culture become less oppressive than in the past the economy be take a very rough ride a it also underwent the effect of a `` free market '' these effect hit everywhere include the space program mission at all level be cut back the soviet begin make almost desperate attempt to cooperate with other space-faring nation either to keep their remain program alive or just to make money in early 1992 it be report that the soviet be offering for sale several fully-equipped veneras they have in storage for the price of 1.6 million dollar each an incredibly low price for any planetary probe no nation take them up on the bargain meanwhile the united state be gear up for new venus mission of their own magellan and galileo the u.s. reactivate their long-dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989. aboard the shuttle be the magellan spacecraft a combination of spare part from other u.s. probe design to make the most detailed and complete radar-mapping of venus in history when magellan reach the second world in august of 1990 it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108 meter 360 foot surpass the ability of venera 15 and 16. in the interim another american probe be launch from a space shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on it way to orbit the giant planet jupiter in 1995. on october 18 1989 the shuttle atlantis release it second unmanned planetary probe into space name galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discover the probe 's primary target 's major moon in 1610. in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe be sent around venus and earth several time to build up enough speed to reach jupiter a a result venus become galileo 's first planetary goal in february of 1990. the probe radioed back image of the planet 's swirl cloud and far indication of lightning in that violent atmosphere on the draw board with the incredible success of magellan in the last few year new plan have be laid out for far journey to venus scien- tists in the u.s. have talk to space scientist in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent state since january 1 1992 of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander mission within in the next decade japan india and the esa have also consider their own venus mission in the next few decade in february of 1993 nasa come up with several new venus project a part of their discovery program for launch inexpensive probe throughout the solar system for venus two mission be select for far study a venus multiprobe mission involve the land of fourteen small probe over one hemisphere to measure wind air temperature and pressure and the venus composition probe design to study venus atmosphere while descend through the thick air with the aid of a parachute much a the soviet have do since 1967. final project decision will be make in 1994. human on venus will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus at present the lead-melting temperature and crush air pressure would be threaten to any earth life not protect in something even tougher than a venera lander plan have be look into change the environment of venus itself into something more like earth 's however it should be note that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability to speed up the planet 's rotation rate to something a bit faster than once every 243 earth day such a project may take century if not millennium in the meantime effort should be make to well understand venus a it exists today we still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important way become instead such a deadly place will earth ever suffer this fate perhaps venus hold the answer such answer may best be found through international cooperation include the nation which make the first

year ancient astronomer observe point of light that appear to move among the star they call these object planet meaning wanderer and name them after roman deity -- jupiter king of the god mar the god of war mercury messenger of the god venus the god of love and beauty and saturn father of jupiter and god of agriculture the stargazer also observe comet with sparkle tail and meteor or shoot star apparently fall from the sky science flourish during the european renaissance fundamental physical law govern planetary motion be discover and the orbit of the planet around the sun be calculate in the 17th century astronomer point a new device call the telescope at the heaven and make startle discovery but the year since 1959 have amount to a golden age of solar system exploration advancement in rocketry after world war ii enable our machine to break the grip of earth 's gravity and travel to the moon and to other planet the united state have sent automate spacecraft then human-crewed expedition to explore the moon our automate machine have orbit and land on venus and mar explore the sun 's environment observe comet and make close-range survey while fly past mercury jupiter saturn uranus and neptune these traveler brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understand of the solar system through the electronic sight and other `` sens '' of our automate spacecraft color and complexion have be give to world that for century appear to earth-bound eye a fuzzy disk or indistinct point of light and dozen of previously unknown object have be discover future historian will likely view these pioneer flight through the solar system a some of the most remarkable achievement of the 20th century automate spacecraft the national aeronautics and space administration 's nasa 's automate spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shape and size while they be design to fulfill separate and specific mission objective the craft share much in common each spacecraft consists of various scientific instrument select for a particular mission support by basic subsystem for electrical power trajectory and orientation control a well a for processing data and communicate with earth electrical power be require to operate the spacecraft instrument and system nasa us both solar energy from array of photovoltaic cell and small nuclear generator to power it solar system mission rechargeable battery be employ for backup and supplemental power imagine that a spacecraft have successfully journeyed million of mile through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have it camera and other sense instrument point the wrong way a it speed past the target to help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thruster be use to control spacecraft the thruster be link with device that maintain a constant gaze at select star just a earth 's early seafarer use the star to navigate the ocean spacecraft use star to maintain their bearing in space with the subsystem lock onto fix point of reference flight controller can keep a spacecraft 's scientific instrument point at the target body and the craft 's communication antenna point toward earth the thruster can also be use to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body be encounter at the plan distance and on the proper trajectory between 1959 and 1971 nasa spacecraft be dispatch to study the moon and the solar environment they also scan the inner planet other than earth -- mercury venus and mar these three world and our own be know a the terrestrial planet because they share a solid-rock composition for the early planetary reconnaissance mission nasa employ a highly successful series of spacecraft call the mariner their flight help shape the planning of later mission between 1962 and 1975 seven mariner mission conduct the first survey of our planetary neighbor in space all of the mariner use solar panel a their primary power source the first and the final version of the spacecraft have two wing cover with photovoltaic cell other mariner be equip with four solar panel extend from their octagonal body although the mariner range from the mariner 2 venus spacecraft weigh in at 203 kilogram 447 pound to the mariner 9 mar orbiter weigh in at 974 kilogram 2,147 pound their basic design remain quite similar throughout the program the mariner 5 venus spacecraft for example have originally be a backup for the mariner 4 mar flyby the mariner 10 spacecraft sent to venus and mercury use component left over from the mariner 9 mar orbiter program in 1972 nasa launch pioneer 10 a jupiter spacecraft interest be shift to four of the outer planet -- jupiter saturn uranus and neptune -- giant ball of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial world we have already survey four nasa spacecraft in all -- two pioneer and two voyager -- be sent in the 1970s to tour the outer region of our solar system because of the distance involve these traveler take anywhere from 20 month to 12 year to reach their destination bar faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifact to journey to distant star because the sun's light becomes so faint in the outer solar system these traveler do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generate by heat from the decay of radioisotope nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbor mar and venus in the middle and late 1970s twin viking lander be equip to serve a seismic and weather station and a biology laboratory two advanced orbiter -- descendant of the mariner craft -- carry the viking lander from earth and then study martian feature from above two drum-shaped pioneer spacecraft visit venus in 1978. the pioneer venus orbiter be equip with a radar instrument that allow it to `` see '' through the planet 's dense cloud cover to study surface feature the pioneer venus multiprobe carry four probe that be drop through the cloud the probe and the main body -- all of which contain scientific instrument -- radioed information about the planet 's atmosphere during their descent toward the surface a new generation of automate spacecraft -- include magellan galileo ulysses mar observer the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby craf and cassini -- be be developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examination that will increase our understand of our neighborhood and our own planet the sun a discussion of the object in the solar system must start with the sun the sun dwarf the other body represent approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system all of the planet moon asteroid comet dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent this 0.14 percent represent the material left over from the sun 's formation one hundred and nine earth would be require to fit across the sun 's disk and it interior could hold over 1.3 million earth a a star the sun generates energy through the process of fusion the temperature at the sun 's core be 15 million degree celsius 27 million degree fahrenheit and the pressure there be 340 billion time earth 's air pressure at sea level the sun's surface temperature of 5,500 degree celsius 10,000 degree fahrenheit seem almost chilly compare to it core-temperature at the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium produce energy the sun also produce a strong magnetic field and stream of charge particle both extend far beyond the planet the sun appear to have be active for 4.6 billion year and have enough fuel to go on for another five billion year or so at the end of it life the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier element and begin to swell up ultimately grow so large that it will swallow earth after a billion year a a '' red giant '' it will suddenly collapse into a `` white dwarf '' -- the final end product of a star like ours it may take a trillion year to cool off completely many spacecraft have explore the sun 's environment but none have gotten any closer to it surface than approximately two-thirds of the distance from earth to the sun pioneer 5-11 the pioneer venus orbiter voyager 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sample the solar environment the ulysses spacecraft launch on october 6 1990 be a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency after use jupiter 's gravity to change it trajectory ulysses will fly over the sun 's polar region during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of study use nine onboard scientific instrument we be fortunate that the sun be exactly the way it be if it be different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have developed on earth mercury obtain the first close-up view of mercury be the primary objective of the mariner 10 spacecraft launch on november 3 1973 from kennedy space center in florida after a journey of nearly five month which include a flyby of venus the spacecraft pass within 703 kilometer 437 mile of the solar system 's innermost planet on march 29 1974. until mariner 10 little be know about mercury even the best telescopic view from earth show mercury a an indistinct object lack any surface detail the planet be so close to the sun that it be usually lose in solar glare when the planet be visible on earth 's horizon just after sunset or before dawn it be obscure by the haze and dust in our atmosphere only radar telescope give any hint of mercury 's surface condition prior to the voyage of mariner 10. the photograph mariner 10 radioed back to earth reveal an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resemble our own moon the picture also show huge cliff crisscross the planet these apparently be create when mercury 's interior cool and shrank buckling the planet 's crust the cliff be a high a 3 kilometer 2 mile and a long a 500 kilometer 310 mile instrument on mariner 10 discover that mercury have a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the density of earth 's atmosphere and compose chiefly of argon neon and helium when the planet 's orbit take it closest to the sun surface temperature range from 467 degree celsius 872 degree fahrenheit on mercury 's sunlit side to -183 degree celsius -298 degree fahrenheit on the dark side this range in surface temperature -- 650 degree celsius 1,170 degree fahrenheit -- be the large for a single body in the solar system mercury literally bakes and freeze at the same time day and night be long on mercury the combination of a slow rotation relative to the star 59 earth day and a rapid revolution around the sun 88 earth day mean that one mercury solar day take 176 earth day or two mercury year -- the time it take the innermost planet to complete two orbit around the sun mercury appear to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth scientist believe mercury have a heavy iron-rich core make up slightly less than half of it volume that would make mercury 's core large proportionally than the moon 's core or those of any of the planet after the initial mercury encounter mariner 10 make two additional flybys -- on september 21 1974 and march 16 1975 -- before control gas use to orient the spacecraft be exhaust and the mission be conclude each flyby take place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet be illuminate a a result we still have not see one-half of the planet 's surface venus veil by dense cloud cover venus -- our near planetary neighbor -- be the first planet to be explore the mariner 2 spacecraft launch on august 27 1962 be the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet mission to study the mysterious planet a spacecraft flew by or orbit venus plunge into the atmosphere or gently land on venus surface romantic myth and speculation about our neighbor be laid to rest on december 14 1962 mariner 2 pass within 34,839 kilometer 21,648 mile of venus and become the first spacecraft to scan another planet onboard instrument measure venus for 42 minute mariner 5 launch in june 1967 flew much closer to the planet passing within 4,094 kilometer 2,544 mile of venus on the second american flyby mariner 5's instrument measure the planet 's magnetic field ionosphere radiation belt and temperature on it way to mercury mariner 10 flew by venus and transmit ultraviolet picture to earth show cloud circulation pattern in the venusian atmosphere in the spring and summer of 1978 two spacecraft be launch to far unravel the mystery of venus on december 4 of the same year the pioneer venus orbiter become the first spacecraft place in orbit around the planet five day later the five separate component make up the second spacecraft -- the pioneer venus multiprobe -- enter the venusian atmosphere at different location above the planet the four small independent probe and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the surface although design to examine the atmosphere one of the probe survive it impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour venus resembles earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other know planet however spacecraft have discover significant difference a well for example venus rotation west to east be retrograde backward compare to the east-to-west spin of earth and most of the other planet approximately 96.5 percent of venus atmosphere 95 time a dense a earth 's be carbon dioxide the principal constituent of earth 's atmosphere be nitrogen venus atmosphere act like a greenhouse permit solar radiation to reach the surface but trap the heat that would ordinarily be radiate back into space a a result the planet 's average surface temperature be 482 degree celsius 900 degree fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provide the first mean of see through the planet 's dense cloud cover and determine surface feature over almost the entire planet nasa 's magellan spacecraft launch on may 5 1989 have be in orbit around venus since august 10 1990. the spacecraft us radar-mapping technique to provide ultrahigh-resolution image of the surface magellan have reveal a landscape dominate by volcanic feature fault and impact crater huge area of the surface show evidence of multiple period of lava flood with flow lie on top of previous one an elevate region name ishtar terra be a lava-filled basin a large a the united state at one end of this plateau sits maxwell monte a mountain the size of mount everest scar the mountain 's flank be a 100-kilometer 62-mile wide 2.5-kilometer 1.5-mile deep impact crater name cleopatra almost all feature on venus be name for woman maxwell monte alpha regio and beta regio be the exception crater survive on venus for perhaps 400 million year because there be no water and very little wind erosion extensive fault-line network cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flex that produce plate tectonics on earth but on venus the surface temperature be sufficient to weaken the rock which crack just about everywhere prevent the formation of major plate and large earthquake fault like the san andreas fault in california venus predominant weather pattern be a high-altitude high-speed circulation of cloud that contain sulfuric acid at speed reach a high a 360 kilometer 225 mile per hour the cloud circle the planet in only four earth day the circulation be in the same direction -- west to east -- a venus' slow rotation of 243 earth day whereas earth 's wind blow in both direction -- west to east and east to west -- in six alternate band venus atmosphere serf a a simplify laboratory for the study of our weather earth a view from space our world 's distinguish characteristic be it blue water brown and green land mass and white cloud we be envelop by an ocean of air consist of 78 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituent the only planet in the solar system know to harbor life earth orbit the sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometer 93 million mile earth be the third planet from the sun and the fifth large in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometer large than that of venus our planet 's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shield u from nearly all of the harmful radiation come from the sun and other star earth 's atmosphere protects u from meteor a well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface active geological process have left no evidence of the pelt earth almost certainly receive soon after it form -- about 4.6 billion year ago along with the other newly form planet it be shower by space debris in the early day of the solar system from our journey into space we have learn much about our home planet the first american satellite -- explorer 1 -- be launch from cape canaveral in florida on january 31 1958 and discover an intense radiation zone now call the van allen radiation belt surround earth since then other research satellite have reveal that our planet 's magnetic field be distort into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind -- the stream of charge particle continuously eject from the sun we 've learn that the magnetic field do not fade off into space but have definite boundary and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believe calm and uneventful seethes with activity -- swell by day and contract by night affected by change in solar activity the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth besides affect earth 's weather solar activity give rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere when charge particle from the solar wind become trap in earth 's magnetic field they collide with air molecule above our planet's magnetic pole these air molecule then begin to glow and be know a the aurora or the northern and southern light satellite about 35,789 kilometer 22,238 mile out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting these watchful electronic eye warn u of dangerous storm continuous global monitoring provide a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a well understand of earth 's complex weather system from their unique vantage point satellite can survey earth 's ocean land use and resource and monitor the planet's health these eye in space have save countless life provide tremendous convenience and show u that we may be alter our planet in dangerous way the moon the moon be earth 's single natural satellite the first human footstep on an alien world be make by american astronaut on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless companion in preparation for the human-crewed apollo expedition nasa dispatch the automate ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between 1964 and 1968. nasa 's apollo program left a large legacy of lunar material and data six two-astronaut crew land on and explore the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972 carry back a collection of rock and soil weigh a total of 382 kilogram 842 pound and consist of more than 2,000 separate sample from this material and other study scientist have construct a history of the moon that include it infancy rock collect from the lunar highland date to about 4.0-4.3 billion year old the first few million year of the moon's existence be so violent that few trace of this period remain a a molten outer layer gradually cool and solidify into different kind of rock the moon be bombard by huge asteroid and small object some of the asteroid be a large a rhode island or delaware and their collision with the moon create basin hundred of kilometer across this catastrophic bombardment taper off approximately four billion year ago leave the lunar highland cover with huge overlap crater and a deep layer of shatter and broken rock heat produce by the decay of radioactive element begin to melt the interior of the moon at depth of about 200 kilometer 125 mile below the surface then for the next 700 million year -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion year ago -- lava rise from inside the moon the lava gradually spread out over the surface flood the large impact basin to form the dark area that galileo galilei an astronomer of the italian renaissance call maria meaning sea a far a we can tell there have be no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion year since then the lunar surface have be alter only by micrometeorite by the atomic particle from the sun and star by the rare impact of large meteorite and by spacecraft and astronaut if our astronaut have land on the moon a billion year ago they would have see a landscape very similar to the one today thousand of year from now the footstep left by the apollo crew will remain sharp and clear the origin of the moon be still a mystery four theory attempt an explanation the moon form near earth a a separate body it be torn from earth it form somewhere else and be capture by our planet 's gravity or it be the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mar the last theory have some good support but be far from certain mar of all the planet mar have long be consider the solar system 's prime candidate for harbor extraterrestrial life astronomer study the red planet through telescope saw what appear to be straight line crisscross it surface these observation -- later determine to be optical illusion -- lead to the popular notion that intelligent being have construct a system of irrigation canal on the planet in 1938 when orson welles broadcast a radio drama base on the science fiction classic war of the world by h.g well enough people believe in the tale of invade martian to cause a near panic another reason for scientist to expect life on mar have to do with the apparent seasonal color change on the planet's surface this phenomenon lead to speculation that condition might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer month and cause plant life to become dormant during colder period so far six american mission to mar have be carry out four mariner spacecraft -- three fly by the planet and one place into martian orbit -- survey the planet extensively before the viking orbiter and lander arrive mariner 4 launch in late 1964 flew past mar on july 14 1965 come within 9,846 kilometer 6,118 mile of the surface transmit to earth 22 close-up picture of the planet the spacecraft found many crater and naturally occur channel but no evidence of artificial canal or flow water mariner 6 and 7 follow with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and return 201 picture mariner 4 6 and 7 show a diversity of surface condition a well a a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide on may 30 1971 the mariner 9 orbiter be launch on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface the spacecraft arrive five and a half month after lift-off only to find mar in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that make surface photography impossible for several week but after the storm clear mariner 9 begin return the first of 7,329 picture these reveal previously unknown martian feature include evidence that large amount of water once flow across the surface etch river valley and flood plain in august and september 1975 the viking 1 and 2 spacecraft -- each consist of an orbiter and a lander -- lift off from kennedy space center the mission be design to answer several question about the red planet include be there life there nobody expect the spacecraft to spot martian city but it be hop that the biology experiment on the viking lander would at least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present viking lander 1 become the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it land on july 20 1976 while the united state be celebrate it bicentennial photo sent back from the chryse planitia `` plain of gold '' show a bleak rusty-red landscape panoramic image return by the lander reveal a roll plain litter with rock and marked by ripple sand dune fine red dust from the martian soil give the sky a salmon hue when viking lander 2 touch down on utopia planitia on september 3 1976 it view a more roll landscape than the one see by it predecessor -- one without visible dune the result sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander be inconclusive small sample of the red martian soil be test in three different experiment design to detect biological process while some of the test result seem to indicate biological activity later analysis confirm that this activity be inorganic in nature and related to the planet 's soil chemistry be there life on mar no one know for sure but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecule exist there the viking lander become weather station record wind velocity and direction a well a atmospheric temperature and pressure few weather change be observe the high temperature record by either craft be -14 degree celsius 7 degree fahrenheit at the viking lander 1 site in midsummer the low temperature -120 degree celsius -184 degree fahrenheit be record at the more northerly viking lander 2 site during winter near-hurricane wind speed be measure at the two martian weather station during global dust storm but because the atmosphere be so thin wind force be minimal viking lander 2 photograph light patch of frost -- probably water-ice -- during it second winter on the planet the martian atmosphere like that of venus be primarily carbon dioxide nitrogen and oxygen be present only in small percentage martian air contains only about 1/1,000 a much water a our air but even this small amount can condense out form cloud that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slope of tower volcano local patch of early morning fog can form in valley there be evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allow water to flow on the planet physical feature closely resemble shoreline gorge riverbed and island suggest that great river once marked the planet mar have two moon phobos and deimos they be small and irregularly shape and posse ancient cratered surface it be possible the moon be originally asteroid that venture too close to mar and be capture by it gravity the viking orbiter and lander exceed by large margin their design lifetime of 120 and 90 day respectively the first to fail be viking orbiter 2 which stop operating on july 24 1978 when a leak deplete it attitude-control gas viking lander 2 operate until april 12 1980 when it be shut down because of battery degeneration viking orbiter 1 quit on august 7 1980 when the last of it attitude-control gas be use up viking lander 1 cease function on november 13 1983. despite the inconclusive result of the viking biology experiment we know more about mar than any other planet except earth nasa 's mar observer spacecraft to be launch in september 1992 will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet asteroid the solar system have a large number of rocky and metallic object that be in orbit around the sun but be too small to be consider full-fledged planet these object be know a asteroid or minor planet most but not all be found in a band or belt between the orbit of mar and jupiter some have orbit that cross earth 's path and there be evidence that earth have be hit by asteroid in the past one of the least erode best preserve example be the barringer meteor crater near winslow arizona asteroid be material left over from the formation of the solar system one theory suggests that they be the remains of a planet that be destroyed in a massive collision long ago more likely asteroid be material that never coalesce into a planet in fact if the estimate total mass of all asteroid be gather into a single object the object would be only about 1,500 kilometer 932 mile across -- less than half the diameter of our moon thousand of asteroid have be identify from earth it be estimate that 100,000 be bright enough to eventually be photograph through earth-based telescope much of our understand about asteroid come from examine piece of space debris that fall to the surface of earth asteroid that be on a collision course with earth be call meteoroid when a meteoroid strike our atmosphere at high velocity friction cause this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light know a a meteor if the meteoroid do not burn up completely what 's left strike earth 's surface and be call a meteorite one of the best place to look for meteorite be the ice cap of antarctica of all the meteorite examine 92.8 percent be compose of silicate stone and 5.7 percent be compose of iron and nickel the rest be a mixture of the three material stony meteorite be the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rock since asteroid be material from the very early solar system scientist be interested in their composition spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt be really quite empty and that asteroid be separate by very large distance current and future mission will fly by select asteroid for closer examination the galileo orbiter launch by nasa in october 1989 will investigate main-belt asteroid on it way to jupiter the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby craf and cassini mission will also study these far-flung object schedule for launch in the latter part of the 1990s the craf and cassini mission be a collaborative project of nasa the european space agency and the federal space agency of germany and italy a well a the united state air force and the department of energy one day space factory will mine the asteroid for raw material jupiter beyond mar and the asteroid belt in the outer region of our solar system lie the giant planet of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune in 1972 nasa dispatch the first of four spacecraft slat to conduct the initial survey of these colossal world of gas and their moon of ice and rock jupiter be the first port of call pioneer 10 which lift off from kennedy space center in march 1972 be the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer region of the solar system in december 1973 it return the first close-up image of jupiter fly within 132,252 kilometer 82,178 mile of the planet's band cloud top pioneer 11 follow a year later voyager 1 and 2 be launch in the summer of 1977 and return spectacular photograph of jupiter and it family of satellite during flybys in 1979. these traveler found jupiter to be a whirl ball of liquid hydrogen and helium topped with a colorful atmosphere compose mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium ammonia ice crystal form white jovian cloud sulfur compound and perhaps phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hue that characterize jupiter 's atmosphere it be likely that methane ammonia water and other gas react to form organic molecule in the region between the planet 's frigid cloud top and the warmer hydrogen ocean lie below because of jupiter 's atmospheric dynamic however these organic compound -- if they exist -- be probably short-lived the great red spot have be observe for century through telescope on earth this hurricane-like storm in jupiter's atmosphere be more than twice the size of our planet a a high-pressure region the great red spot spin in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storm on jupiter it be surround by swirl current that rotate around the spot and be sometimes consume by it the great red spot might be a million year old our spacecraft detect lightning in jupiter 's upper atmosphere and observe auroral emission similar to earth's northern light at the jovian polar region voyager 1 return the first image of a faint narrow ring encircle jupiter large of the solar system 's planet jupiter rotates at a dizzy pace -- once every 9 hour 55 minute 30 second the massive planet take almost 12 earth year to complete a journey around the sun with 16 know moon jupiter be something of a miniature solar system a new mission to jupiter -- the galileo project -- be under way after a six- year cruise that take the galileo orbiter once past venus twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroid the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiter 's cloud layer and relay data back to earth the galileo orbiter will spend two year circle the planet and fly close to jupiter 's large moon explore in detail what the two pioneer and two voyager reveal galilean satellite in 1610 galileo galilei aim his telescope at jupiter and spot four point of light orbit the planet for the first time human have see the moon of another world in honor of their discoverer these four body would become know a the galilean satellite or moon but galileo might have happily trade this honor for one look at the dazzle photograph return by the voyager spacecraft a they flew past these planet-sized satellite one of the most remarkable finding of the voyager mission be the presence of active volcano on the galilean moon io volcanic eruption have never before be observe on a world other than earth the voyager camera identify at least nine active volcano on io with plume of eject material extend a far a 280 kilometer 175 mile above the moon 's surface io 's pizza-colored terrain marked by orange and yellow hue be probably the result of sulfur-rich material brought to the surface by volcanic activity volcanic activity on this satellite be the result of tidal flex cause by the gravitational tug-of-war between io jupiter and the other three galilean moon europa approximately the same size a our moon be the brightest galilean satellite the moon 's surface display a complex array of streak indicate the crust have be fracture caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like io europa have be heat enough to cause it interior ice to melt -- apparently produce a liquid-water ocean this ocean be cover by an ice crust that have form where water be expose to the cold of space europa 's core be make of rock that sank to it center like europa the other two galilean moon -- ganymede and callisto -- be world of ice and rock ganymede be the large satellite in the solar system -- large than the planet mercury and pluto the satellite be compose of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock ganymede 's surface have area of different brightness indicate that in the past material ooze out of the moon 's interior and be deposit at various location on the surface callisto only slightly small than ganymede have the low density of any galilean satellite suggest that large amount of water be part of it composition callisto be the most heavily cratered object in the solar system no activity during it history have erase old crater except more impact detailed study of all the galilean satellite will be perform by the galileo orbiter saturn no planet in the solar system be adorn like saturn it exquisite ring system be unrivaled like jupiter saturn be compose mostly of hydrogen but in contrast to the vivid color and wild turbulence found in jovian cloud saturn 's atmosphere have a more subtle butterscotch hue and it marking be mute by high-altitude haze give saturn 's somewhat placid-looking appearance scientist be surprised at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blow some 1,770 kilometer 1,100 mile per hour three american spacecraft have visit saturn pioneer 11 speed by the planet and it moon titan in september 1979 return the first close-up image voyager 1 follow in november 1980 send back breathtaking photograph that reveal for the first time the complexity of saturn 's ring system and moon voyager 2 flew by the planet and it moon in august 1981. the ring be compose of countless low-density particle orbit individually around saturn 's equator at progressive distance from the cloud top analysis of spacecraft radio wave passing through the ring show that the particle vary widely in size range from dust to house-sized boulder the ring be bright because they be mostly ice and frost rock the ring might have result when a moon or a passing body venture too close to saturn the unlucky object would have be torn apart by great tidal force on it surface and in it interior or the object may not have be fully form to begin with and disintegrate under the influence of saturn 's gravity a third possibility be that the object be shatter by collision with large object orbit the planet unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particle appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and it satellite these complex gravitational interaction form the thousand of ringlet that make up the major ring radio emission quite similar to the static heard on an be car radio during an electrical storm be detect by the voyager spacecraft these emission be typical of lightning but be believe to be come from saturn 's ring system rather than it atmosphere where no lightning be observe a they have at jupiter the voyager saw a version of earth 's aurora near saturn 's pole the voyager discover new moon and found several satellite that share the same orbit we learn that some moon shepherd ring particle maintain saturn 's ring and the gap in the ring saturn 's 18th moon be discover in 1990 from image take by voyager 2 in 1981. voyager 1 determine that titan have a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like earth 's in composition than the carbon dioxide atmosphere of mar and venus titan 's surface temperature of -179 degree celsius -290 degree fahrenheit implies that there might be water-ice island rise above ocean of ethane-methane liquid or sludge unfortunately voyager 's camera could not penetrate the moon's dense cloud continue photochemistry from solar radiation may be convert titan 's methane to ethane acetylene and -- in combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide the latter compound be a building block of amino acid these condition may be similar to the atmospheric condition of primeval earth between three and four billion year ago however titan's atmospheric temperature be believe to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe call huygens which will be drop into titan 's atmosphere and fall to the surface cassini will use the probe a well a radar to peer through titan 's cloud and will spend year examine the saturnian system uranus in january 1986 four and a half year after visit saturn voyager 2 complete the first close-up survey of the uranian system the brief flyby reveal more information about uranus and it retinue of icy moon than have be glean from ground observation since the planet 's discovery over two century ago by the english astronomer william herschel uranus third large of the planet be an oddball of the solar system unlike the other planet with the exception of pluto this giant lie tipped on it side with it north and south pole alternately face the sun during an 84-year swing around the solar system during voyager 2 's flyby the south pole face the sun uranus might have be knock over when an earth-sized object collide with it early in the life of the solar system voyager 2 found that uranus magnetic field do not follow the usual north-south axis found on the other planet instead the field be tilt 60 degree and offset from the planet's center a phenomenon that on earth would be like have one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakarta on the island of java in indonesia uranus atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen with some 12 percent helium and small amount of ammonia methane and water vapor the planet 's blue color occurs because methane in it atmosphere absorbs all other color wind speed range up to 580 kilometer 360 mile per hour and temperature near the cloud top average -221 degree celsius -366 degree fahrenheit uranus sunlit south pole be shroud in a kind of photochemical `` smog '' believe to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlight-generated chemical surround the planet 's atmosphere and extend thousand of kilometer into space be a mysterious ultraviolet sheen know a `` electroglow '' approximately 8,000 kilometer 5,000 mile below uranus' cloud top there be thought to be a scald ocean of water and dissolve ammonia some 10,000 kilometer 6,200 mile deep beneath this ocean be an earth-sized core of heavier material voyager 2 discover 10 new moon 16-169 kilometer 10-105 mile in diameter orbit uranus the five previously know -- miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon -- range in size from 520 to 1,610 kilometer 323 to 1,000 mile across represent a geological showcase these five moon be half-ice half-rock sphere that be cold and dark and show evidence of past activity include fault and ice flow the most remarkable of uranus moon be miranda it surface feature high cliff a well a canyon crater-pocked plain and wind valley the sharp variation in terrain suggest that after the moon form it be smash apart by a collision with another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system which contains many object that have impact crater or be fragment from large impact what be extraordinary be that miranda apparently reform with some of the material that have be in it interior expose on it surface uranus be thought to have nine dark ring voyager 2 image 11. in contrast to saturn 's ring which be compose of bright particle uranus ring be primarily make up of dark boulder-sized chunk neptune voyager 2 complete it 12-year tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planet 's moon on august 25 1989 the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometer 3,010 mile of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton during the neptune encounter it become clear that the planet's atmosphere be more active than uranus voyager 2 observe the great dark spot a circular storm the size of earth in neptune 's atmosphere resemble jupiter's great red spot the storm spin counterclockwise and move westward at almost 1,200 kilometer 745 mile per hour voyager 2 also note a small dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed the `` scooter '' a well a high-altitude cloud over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the high wind speed of any planet be observe up to 2,400 kilometer 1,500 mile per hour like the other giant planet neptune have a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planet 's core contains a high percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giant neptune 's distinctive blue appearance like uranus blue color be due to atmospheric methane neptune 's magnetic field be tilt relative to the planet's spin axis and be not center at the core this phenomenon be similar to uranus magnetic field and suggests that the field of the two giant be be generate in an area above the core where the pressure be so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical property of a metal earth 's magnetic field on the other hand be produce by it spin metallic core and be only slightly tilt and offset relative to it center voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of neptune 's ring observation from earth indicate that there be arc of material in orbit around the giant planet it be not clear how neptune could have arc and how these could be kept from spread out into even unclumped ring voyager 2 detect these arc but they be in fact part of thin complete ring a number of small moon could explain the arc but such body be not spot astronomer have identify the neptunian moon triton in 1846 and nereid in 1949. voyager 2 found six more one of the new moon -- proteus -- be actually large than nereid but since proteus orbit close to neptune it be lose in the planet's glare for observer on earth triton circle neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six day tidal force on triton be cause it to spiral slowly towards the planet in 10 to 100 million year a short time in astronomical term the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart form a spectacular ring to accompany the planet 's modest current ring triton 's landscape be a strange and unexpected a those of io and miranda the moon have more rock than it counterpart at saturn and uranus triton 's mantle be probably compose of water-ice but the moon 's crust be a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane the moon show two dramatically different type of terrain the so-called `` cantaloupe '' terrain and a recede ice cap dark streak appear on the ice cap these streak be the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vent that shoot nitrogen gas and dark fine-grained particle to height of 2 to 8 kilometer 1 to 5 mile triton 's thin atmosphere only 1/70,000th a thick a earth 's have wind that carry the dark particle and deposit them a streak on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet found in the solar system -235 degree celsius -391 degree fahrenheit triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visit pluto pluto be the most distant of the planet yet the eccentricity of it orbit periodically carry it inside neptune 's orbit where it have be since 1979 and where it will remain until march 1999. pluto 's orbit be also highly inclined -- tilt 17 degree to the orbital plane of the other planet discover in 1930 pluto appear to be little more than a celestial snowball the planet 's diameter be calculate to be approximately 2,300 kilometer 1,430 mile only two-thirds the size of our moon ground-based observation indicate that pluto's surface be cover with methane ice and that there be a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface a the planet move away from the sun observation also show that pluto 's spin axis be tipped by 122 degree the planet have one know satellite charon discover in 1978. charon 's surface composition be different from pluto 's the moon appear to be cover with water-ice rather than methane ice it orbit be gravitationally lock with pluto so both body always keep the same hemisphere face each other pluto's and charon 's rotational period and charon 's period of revolution be all 6.4 earth day although no spacecraft have ever visit pluto nasa be currently explore the possibility of such a mission comet the outermost member of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planet a asteroid be the rocky and metallic remnant of the formation of the solar system comet be the icy debris from that dim begin and can survive only far from the sun most comet nucleus reside in the oort cloud a loose swarm of object in a halo beyond the planet and reach perhaps halfway to the near star comet nucleus orbit in this frozen abyss until they be gravitationally perturbed into new orbit that carry them close to the sun a a nucleus fall inside the orbit of the outer planet the volatile element of which it be make gradually warm by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planet these volatile element be boil the nucleus itself be irregular and only a few mile across and be make principally of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- material very similar to those compose the moon of the giant planet a these material boil off of the nucleus they form a coma or cloud-like `` head '' that can measure ten of thousand of kilometer across the coma grows a the comet get closer to the sun the stream of charge particle come from the sun push on this cloud blowing it back like a flag in the wind and give rise to the comet 's `` tail '' gas and ion be blown directly back from the nucleus but dust particle be push more slowly a the nucleus continue in it orbit the dust particle be left behind in a curve arc both the gas and dust tail point away from the sun in effect the comet chase it tail a it recedes from the sun the tail can reach 150 million kilometer 93 million mile in length but the total amount of material contain in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase comet -- from the latin cometa meaning `` long-haired '' -- be essentially dramatic light show some comet pas through the solar system only once but others have their orbit gravitationally modify by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planet these latter visitor can enter close elliptical orbit and repeatedly return to the inner solar system halley 's comet be the most famous example of a relatively short period comet return on an average of once every 76 year and orbit from beyond neptune to within venus orbit confirm sighting of the comet go back to 240 b.c this regular visitor to our solar system be name for sir edmond halley because he plot the comet 's orbit and predict it return base on earlier sighting and newtonian law of motion his name become part of astronomical lore when in 1759 the comet return on schedule unfortunately sir edmond do not live to see it a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it pass comparatively close to earth unfortunately on it most recent appearance halley 's comet pass no closer than 62.4 million kilometer 38.8 million mile from our world the comet be visible to the naked eye especially for viewer in the southern hemisphere but it be not spectacular comet have be so bright on rare occasion that they be visible during daytime historically comet sighting have be interpret a bad omen and have be artistically render a dagger in the sky the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby craf spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it a they both approach the sun craf will observe the nucleus a it becomes active in the grow sunlight and begin to have it lighter element boil off and form a coma and tail several spacecraft have flown by comet at high speed the first be nasa 's international cometary explorer in 1985. an armada of five spacecraft two japanese two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency flew by halley 's comet in 1986. conclusion despite their effort to peer across the vast distance of space through an obscure atmosphere scientist of the past have only one body they could study closely -- earth but since 1959 spaceflight through the solar system have lift the veil on our neighbor in space we have learn more about our solar system and it member than anyone have in the previous thousand of year our automate spacecraft have travel to the moon and to all the planet beyond our world except pluto they have observe moon a large a small planet flown by comet and sample the solar environment astronomy book now include detailed picture of body that be only smudge in the large telescope for generation we be lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful place and object the knowledge gain from our journey through the solar system have redefine traditional earth science like geology and meteorology and spawn an entirely new discipline call comparative planetology by study the geology of planet moon asteroid and comet and compare difference and similarity we be learn more about the origin and history of these body and the solar system a a whole we be also gain insight into earth 's complex weather system by see how weather be shape on other world and by investigate the

b"the follow be what they feed to u ... .. most have be post already but there be a number of item not see here yet ... .. redesign activity update -- follow be the weekly status on redesign base on information provide by nasa headquarters the station redesign team srt provide a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 22. the day-long meeting be held in anser facility in crystal city va topic cover by the srt include a preliminary mission and goal statement for the space station science technology and engineering research the assessment process and the design approach discussion on management option and operation concept also be held the design team then present the three option under study \xc2\xa5 option a modular buildup -- pete priest present the a option priest say the team be work to define a station that meet cost goal and have identify three distinct phase of evolution power station human tend and permanent presence the team will define the minimum capability need to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget level the a option us current or simplify freedom hardware where cost effective and be consider other exist system such a the so-called `` bus-1 spacecraft '' the orbiter and spacelab the power station capability could be achieve in 3 flight with freedom photo voltaic module provide 20 kw of power 30-day shuttle/spacelab mission docked to the power station be assume for this phase human tend capability would be provide by the addition of the u.s. common module module which add subsystem and 9 payload rack and dock port for esa and japanese laboratory 60-day mission with the orbiter docked to the station be assume for this phase different operation/utilization mode be be study for this phase \xc2\xa5 option b freedom derive -- mike griffin present the status of option b activity griffin detailed the evolution of the freedom-derived option from initial research capability to human-tended capability to permanent human presence capability to two fault tolerance and finally permanent human capability griffin also outline propose system change to the baseline program with minor change to the communication and track system crew health care system and eclss and a major change to the data management system initial research capability would be achieve with 2 flight to 28.5 degree inclination 3 flight to 51.6 degree and consist of an extend duration orbiter-spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic array provide 18.75 kw of power human-tended capability would be achieve in 6 flight and add truss segment and the u.s. lab permanent human presence capability would be achieve in 8 flight with two orbiter provide habitation and assure crew return two fault tolerance achieve in 11 flight would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv module thermal control and propulsion system the freedom derive configuration could achieve an international complete state with 16 flight three more flight to bring up the habitat module a third pv array and two assure crew return vehicle acrv would complete the permanent human capability with international stage griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminate hardware would not by itself meet budget guideline for the freedom derive option major reduction or deferral must occur in other area include program management contractor non-hardware early utilization and operation cost he say \xc2\xa5 option c singe launch core station -- chet vaughn present option c the single launch core station concept a shuttle external tank and solid rocket booster would be use to launch the station into orbit shuttle main engine would be mount to the tail of the station module for launch and jettison after et separation the module 23 foot in diameter and 92 foot long would provide 26,000 cubic foot of pressure volume separate into 7 `` deck '' connect by a centralize passageway seven berthing port would be locate at various place on the circumference of the module to place the international module and other element this `` can '' would have two fix photo voltaic array produce approximately 40 kw of power fly in a solar interial attitude in his closing comment to the redesign advisory committee bryan o'connor say a design freeze would be establish for the 3 option on april 26 so that detailed cost of the option can begin the next meeting with the redesign advisory committee will be may 3.

building on the work of the operation phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasa-jsc which have already begin a comprehensive review of operation and have conclude in it preliminary result that significant cost reduction be possible a part of it work the operation group have identify team of agency expert to develop detailed evaluation of each design in the area of assembly and operation utilization maintenance and logistics and test and ground operation what 's in the week ahead -- the design support team will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the station redesign

b'they can be detach in an emergency but expensive hardware be not thrown away casually bearing in mind that nobody knew the design be defective if the deployment crew have found some nasty flaw -- the lid fail to open for example -- it would have be a bit embarrass to have to throw the solar array away to get the thing back in the payload bay'
b"this do not propose a _mechanism_ for grbs in the oort and no anti-matter annihilation do not fit the spectrum at least a far a i understand annihilation spectrum ... big difference that 's ignore the question of how you fit a distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution be not well know in particular comet aphelion which be not well know be not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution ... merge neutron star be at least a mechanism with about the right energy except it do n't explain why there be no apparent correlation with galaxy or galaxy structure there be no mechanism for get all the energy out in gamma ray with any significant amount of baryon around there will be a lot of pair production which make a plasma which thermalizes the energy it have trouble generate enough energy to explain the most powerful burst 10^52-53 erg it happens too fast compare to the burst duration and it be hard to make tight-binaries of neutron star another cosmological mechinism be the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange star but that us pretty far-out physic my point be that we do n't have a good mechanism at any distance so grb 's be likely to be happen by an unknown mechanism so we can't rule out the oort cloud what would be the spectrum of an event which convert a comet to strange matter the spectrum for primordial black hole eat comet and antimatter comet collide with matter comet be n't quite right but perhaps there be an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum the energy match very well for both of these mechanism accord to trevor week if the `` tunguska meteorite '' be a mini-black hole collision with the earth then there be likely to be enough mini-black hole around that the rate for bh-comet collision match the grb rate well the fact that we do n't know the distribution of comet in the oort cloud be n't a reason to rule them out it make it harder to rule them out the point of the cite paper be that if we assume they get the right distribution for the oort cloud it be hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of grb 's if they get the wrong distribution for the oort cloud they ca n't constrain any oort- cloud grb 's at all"

b"i disagree it think the average joe be interested/curious about spaceflight but see it a an elitist activity not one which he be ever go to participate in why be the general public go to be interested in the technical detail of long term space habitation i like the idea of the study but it should be release to other scientist and engineer who will be able to use it if you want a general public document you 'll need a more general publication a one work on control ecological life support system engineering the microworld be n't the problem the problem be understand the basic chemical biological and medical factor to be able to engineer them efficiently for example the only way we know how to produce food be from plant and animal food synthesis be not very far advanced so we have to orbit a farm well that 's obviously not very efficient so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plant hydroponically instead of use dirt this be where the engineering come in but new technology bring new basic question that we do n't have the answer to like in dirt we can grow tomato and lettuce right beside each other but in hydroponics it turn out that you ca n't do that the lettuce growth be stunt when it 's grown in the same hydroponic solution a tomato so now you have to consider what other plant be go to have similar interaction this mean some basic apply scientific research and that's what need to be do with all technology that have be developed so far we also need to find out how they interact together that 's where we be now first you need to do the literature search there be a lot of information out there maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation this could be useful especially if we make it available on the net then we can look at method of analyze the technology unless there be an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net i think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search first then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis the data base itself could be useful for future engineer that 's my response ken what do you think"

b"interstellar grain be not at all close to blackbody the `` large '' grain have size of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency however at temperature below 100 k 90 of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 micron where radiate efficiency be poor a small antenna can not easily radiate at long wavelength thus the grain must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed moreover the ira observation have a maximum wavelength of 100 micron grain colder than 30 k will radiate primarily at longer wavelength and ira would be relatively insensitive to them in the extreme limit grain a cold a 5 k will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation bad still ira color temperature be heavily contaminate by a population of `` small '' grain these grain have only perhaps 50 atom and when they be hit by a single photon they heat up to temperature of several hundred or 1000 k. of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but _when they be radiating_ the characteristic temperature be several hundred k. even a small population of these grain can dramatically raise the observe '' average '' temperature a model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe data have three component these represent scatter radiation from zodiacal dust color temperature 5500 k thermal emission from zodiacal dust tc 280 k and thermal emission from galactic dust tc=25 k at the ecliptic pole the emissivities or dilution factor be respectively 1.9e-13 4e-8 and 2e-5 the first two be roughly double in the ecliptic plane to find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor time the fourth power of temperature for all component then take the fourth root in the table below starlight come from allen 's number that stellar emission from the whole sky be equivalent to 460 zero mag star with b-v color of 0.75. no doubt careful work could do much well the person who suggest starlight have a dilution factor of e-4 must have be remember wrong we would be cooked if that be the case in any event the energy density of starlight come out about the same a that of the microwave background and i believe that to be correct dilution temp dt^4 microwave background 1 2.7 53 galactic dust 2e-5 25 8 zodiacal dust emission 6e-8 280 369 zodiacal dust scatter 3e-13 5500 275 starlight 1e-13 5500 92 -- -- 797 the fourth root of 797 be 5.3 k. outside the solar system the result would be 3.5 k. i find these result surprising especially the importance of zodiacal dust but i do n't see any serious mistake"

b"this be a good question there be major blind spot in our understand of what make the earth habitable for example why do the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it do the naive answer be `` photosynthesis '' but this be clearly incomplete photosynthesis by itself ca n't make the atmosphere oxygenate a the oxygen produce be consume when the plant decay or be eat what be need be photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the result reduce material on earth this mechanism be burial in seafloor sediment of organic matter mostly from oceanic source however this burial require continental sediment in the deep ocean the burial rate be so slow that most material be consume before it can be sequester this suggests that a planet without large ocean or a planet without continent undergo weather will have a hard time accumulate an oxygen atmosphere in particular an all-ocean planet may have a hard time support an oxygen atmosphere there be also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth 's atmosphere have be relatively stable over geological time for a period at least 2 order of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o2 to weather in the absence of replenishment no convincing feedback mechanism have be identify perhaps the reason be the weak anthropic principle if during the last 500 myr or so the oxygen level have drop too low we would n't be here to be wonder about it"

b"i feel compel to complain the statement that recent observation rule out merge neutron star a source of gamma-ray burst be utterly false even though it be popular enough to make it to batse press release the idea behind the statement be a follow `` if you smack two neutron star together or have a neutron star be gobble up by a black hole a lot of energy be release enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance but so the reason continue this energy be release below a lot of matter so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum the observe spectrum be strongly non-thermal so this model must be wrong '' a so often the fault lie with the imagination of the person who be try to prove the model wrong rather than with the model it may be that the initial energy release be not see a a gamma-ray burst but the 'fireball of energy and matter that be create may spew out a relativistic flow when this slam into the surround medium a strong flux of non-thermal gamma ray result which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy all this be not my idea it be in a series of paper by martin rees peter meszaros sorry for the miss accent and co-worker it be certainly not a complete model but it may well be the best one around sum over all propose distance scale an alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball by the way be the so-called 'failed supernova scenario by stan woosley in which a very massive star at the end of it life collapse to a black hole if the stellar core be rotate part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halt because it be support by centrifugal force and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis which again constitutes relativistic flow the rate of such event may be much high than that of neutron star merger but the flux may be more strongly beam so that the net rate of burst observe on earth stay the same between the two scenario but the energy release per event can be a lot less in the fail supernova scenario on another note i do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolve via some classical astronomical method such a find counterpart to the burst at other wavelength or find a definitive signature of some know class of object in the distribution of position and flux theorist have historically not be too successfull in find the distance of any object by prove that there be only one possible way in which the object can work and therefore it *must* be so-and-so"
