 be the board at all intelligent i e  run by microcontrollers the easy thing would be to have another line that say that one of the board be talk to the pc when this line be true the other board could all hold off and not send their data this a perfect solution though since you have to worry a little about make sure two board decide to talk at the _exact same time_ other than that i think you will need to hook up each board to    something    that speaks rs 232 this actually a hard or a expensive a it use to be though assume the board talk relatively slowly 9600 bps or slow the pic can coordinate thing between themselves to multiplex the data this be really just forbicly add the suggestion in the first paragraph to your system and it assumes that each board talk more than 1 8th of the time of for very long since a pic go to be able to buffer more than maybe 20 some byte you might want to check into the price of multi serial card for your pc though i recently bought a boca research 2x4 card 2 parallel port 4 rs 232 port for a very reasonable 85

 you can design for ramp shutoff brick wall current limit or even fold back cutoff      sounds like you want    brick wall    current limit your lead be correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base drive in order to get the brick  wall you need enough voltage gain on the current sensor normally a darlington on the current sense resistor will be adequate but for infinite gain   use an op amp to sense the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to turn off the base bias on the series pass transistor phase compensation may be necessary with this close loop control system if yopu have more than 180 degree phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain ok
 in article 735604750 28979 0 unix5 andrew cmu edu mark yeck             hey can someone clue me in on these and other weird type of amplifier just a brief intro to the concept behind these would be cool i have the clue on type a b and ab already and stuff but these other one be mention occasionally and i dont know what they do i think type d be like a pwm scheme or something thanx in advanced                the whole point to these weird amplifier type be improve efficiency class d amp  are  pwm pulse width modulation amp which work very much like switch power supply i think see these thing call    class s    before a well capable of very high efficiency and would be suitable for very high power yet to see anything like this use in an audiophile amp though be try to design a three kilowatter for the last year to be use a an inverter for an ups but have be have serious problem with layout parasitics 10 irf 450  s in parallel     any help with a do able isolated drive ckt would be appreciate not absolutely positive about this but i beleive a  class g amp be one that operates off a variable  or switch power supply rail voltage the carver amp do something like this they use some sort of phase control circuit i do not fully understand it operation to reduce the transformer size and i beleive that be patent i have an m400 apart try to fix and found that it have three rail voltage that it switch between i ran a simulation on pspice and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation heat under large signal condition or when drive reactive load which draw high current at the zero voltage crossing

 gladman aviv say    re blue lead  s    to all on 04 24 93 01 51 ga in order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap ga energy within the region of 2 6 to 2 8 electron volt accord to my ga physical electronics prof you get an lead with that band gap ga why you find blue led or for that matter some other ga colour of led that be not to say that blue led be found ga see  blue led sell but they be just your typical visible light ga lead in a blue plastic cover they emit very much light     this be not true they have and do make blue lead  s they be about 2 80 in digikey 470nm wavelength by the way stephen cyberman toz buffalo ny us mangle on sun 04 25 1993 at 13 33 46
 hi folk out there i know whether i be in the right newsgroup but i have a question if i be completely wrong here in this group could you mail me the right name of the correct newsgroup a friend of mine be study electronics at the technical university in karlsruhe germany since one year he want to know whether there be possibility to study audio control engineering in the u s a  do anybody know how to get information about these study in the u s a  could you send me information like e mail adresses of the university    quality    of these study and so on be it possible to e mail the university directly to get information do the university send information via e mail please could you answer via e mail because i read this newsgroup regularly thanks in advance stephan jaeger

 while possible that a ham radio transmitter that hearing it likely every bit of signal that go out the antenna be waste a far a a ham be concerned and most ham be it be the radiate signal that would cause the problem technically competent to ensure that they waste any signal if they can possibly avoid it to get their ham license they have to pas a government exam that test them on that point among others however you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure there be lot of other service where the operator be n t require to be technically competent citizen band    cb    for example there be nothing in the amateur radio test that require an technical competence at all it be a simple matter to memorize all the question and answer however that say most ham that i know do spend quite a bit of time gain some technical skill listen to the interference if you hear voice clearly it almost certainly be n t ham radio and might well be cb if you can record a count on that bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator  s house and ask him for his opinion of what hearing most community you can not do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such schedule if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes if he do then you probably need to have your equipment work on to make it immune to rf interference have a ham radio interference committee whose member be most willing to help you resolve interference complaint look in the phone book or ask at the local ham radio store or call the fcc for contact info the fcc may or may not have such information they have enough to do without get call for such information if nothing else call your city office or police department general business number they should have the name of a local ham contact if a ham more than likely willing to help get rid of the problem after all it would be his signal waste if it the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solution see above your concept of waste signal be erroneous if his rig be transmit properly then the chance of interference with the exception of harmonic television interference be the great since he be put out the strong signal it be unfortunately the case that a transmit station that be operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of the consumer equipment cut corner on one little section of the device that affect one person in a thousand but which bite you often that can be remedied for just a few penny by a knowledgeable person perhaps even the person operating the transmitter hearing unfortunately most consumer equipment be succeptable it be all poorly design btw ham be allow amplifier cb    illegal ham amplifier    compute it do but not for a mobile radio there be very few mobile rig that could power a 1500 watt amplifier

 actually no i have a tape drive in the event of a total hard disk failure i reinstall the apps from original and restore the data from the backup i keep of that with upwards of 100mb of stuff on my hard disk there be no way go to try and back it all up without a tape drive would be nice to have one though maybe maybe not today it happen a often i would hope but then if a bios be buggy and the user get an upgrade the bios information be go to change at least the date anyway tag the bios manufacturer be still go to falsely tag those user who upgrade the motherboard this type of upgrade require a hard disk backup restore a long a it do too terribly often otherwise i think it would get annoy and the user would go look for other software of course not if something get corrupt and my app need to be reinstall the  worst  thing i want that software tell me be    this software have already be register to blank and it be against the law to install it on other machine    or something similar access for window do this and it only require a click on    ok    to go away pretty non intrusive but it get the point across this be a great idea i like the key system that some shareware product use the only problem be that it will be difficult for big software company to implement this without it get very cost ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the user    steve madsen sjmadsen nextsrv cas muohio edu
 well the fast crudest mixer aside from just physically connect all your input together directly be to run each signal through a resistor to a common output the resistor give some isolation so the signal source drive directly into each other take a wild seat of the pants guess say that if you be mix high impedance source like some dynamic mike electric guitar pickup etc  your resistor ought to be maybe 5k 10k or so if you be mix line level stuff or the output of a walkman or such go with 1k input 1                                       output input 2                                      input 3

 sure the way be on different okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part on which the code number or whatever that the program have fixate itself upon go bad you replace that part and now your program run because on a    different    computer this be of course assume that the program us something in rom like the bios serial number maybe and not a disk based code number obviously if the drive go bad be reinstall the stuff anyway i work in a computer lab which be part of the university microlab system we have the wonderfully fun task of maintain well over a hundred machine both pc and macintosh a well a administer a network of over 50 next machine i personally be concerned only with a small lab with ten pc  s and ten mac  s not the manager but help him with admin often imho copy protection scheme of any sort be nothing more than a major headache for the legitimate user anyone who want a copy of your program and care about legality will get a copy period    pirate board    or no pirate board i too have    friend    who blatantly and quite successfuly    hack    copy protection scheme practically in their sleep let  s consider what go on in our lab almost daily we have at least one machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screw up some set or other on a piece of software admittedly we be student mostly be not the world  s most efficient and effective network administrator but we try keep even the twenty machine that be partly my responsibility even vaguely look and    act    similar to the average user and maintain    behind the scenes    consistency be a real headache but not so bad a headache a try to remember twenty different folder location of norton utility when some guy trash his disk often we have hardware problem at peak    business    time and have to do some parts swapping to get stuff work temporarily well i  ll cut to the chase and quit boring y all    the point be often we have to re install software and copy configuration file etc from machine to machine by far the easy way we have found to do this be to get one machine work exactly the way we want to then copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that machine  s type this ensures u that for at least ten minute we have ten identical machine to work with have them networked simplifies this considerably a our major package wordperfect window etc be all network version and thus only one copy to mess with often however we need to install a package request by some instructor to one some or all of the machine for a special project this be usually a hand written or shareware etc program similar to what i believe the original poster be ask about the few we have have with    copy protection    scheme have cause nothing but nightmare for u to maintain in short waste your time with a copy protection scheme sort of like outlaw gun the criminal will get your program anyway and you will only be hurt the legitimate honest user write a good user  s guide and tech manual whatever else for your program please do this regardless of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute the manual to license user jack the price to cut your loss but please take a cue from the major company who can admittedly afford the cost of illegal copy far well than you and burden the legitimate user with a    copy protection    scheme sorry for the tirade but be a long day here    mark s  underwood ee student university of kentucky lab assistant boyd hall microlab a tiny little division of uk library microlabs e mail msunde01 mik uky edu

 if you want slow lead flash rate adjustable by switch or by a 4066 4016 digitally control switch i suggest look at a 555 oscillator chip they cost 1 at radio shack much cheaper in quantity at quality place and you will be able to find good info about simple circuit in a 555 oscialltor notebook i think forest mims have one at radio shack have to toy with resistor capacitor value or you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequency any engineer worth his salt can make a 555 osciallator     in the book and left up to you to see i hate do ascii circuit graphic the 555 can accurately go from a few hz to about 500 khz i think about the tape recorder gizmo you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel a a data line for flash lead and one a audio line for voice or music this would eliminate a lot of noise the data line be probably most easily do by some kind of pll or bandpass filter use just an op amp the 565 chip be a good pll and not hard to work with however if you nothing about how a pll work i suggest you try this op amp information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack info booklets and the popular 741 op amp be a snap to work with set frequency and bandpass filter value be not so easy so i would suggest the 555 method firstmost     i have no idea what this be go into so i be really generalize     a for manufacturing technique if only goof with it i suggest you breadboard the thing     no need to solder wire wrap would be the next more permanent step and lastly soldering pcb make hope that clear thing
 do anyone have recommendation on whether a smart data i o print spooler digital sample etc would be well implement with a dma chip or a dedicate microcontroller essentially what i be try to decide be the best way to handle move data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use by the smart data i o which dma or microcontroller chip would be best to use fast cheap and easy to obtain would be nice but i limit my choice to only those that fit those characteristic even an 8086 8088 under 5 would do what i want but i be sure there be a well alternative    like a microcontroller with onchip e eprom so i essentially want to hear about all dma and microcontrollers that be simple to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a few i o line

 ham can legally run up to 1500 watt it be very unlikely however that a ham would be run that kind of power from a car ham rig not possible either need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier i can just see it you need to slow down on a downgrade so you hit the push to talk button well 100  amp anyway transmission be generally for a short interval the battery would supply the rest of course if you transmit too much you would run the battery down it really would not be that much of a brake even at 50 efficiency 1500 watt would only consume 4 horsepower

 one of the most popular method of course be the password check where they ask you for a word from page x line y and word z but this be pitifully simple to remove unless you throw some checksum into the main part of your program and some self rewriting code to confuse some people also make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger another method of course be to not even make bad sector on the original disk just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector to help you here you also must do the code protection scheme mention in the first paragraph make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated part of the disk with garbage a well or they wan na be cracker can just look for the junk in some random sector like you mention there be the laser hole disk and hardware key but they be both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end user which you be the opposite of what you want another configuration that can be use be to save the configuration of the machine that it be be instal to in the most undecipherable format you can think of if the program do not find that this be the same system it request be instal by the original disk again the original disk should be encrypt compact have many sector that should be checked and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original can not be copy once again you must put code encryption self rewriting code and multiple crc check in the program to make sure that it do not get change among other thing this also protects your program from virii if the program detects a change in it code tell the user that a virus have be detect in the program tell them the program be    virus secure    and remember you have help the world kill some pirate and kill some virus feel good i hope that i have help have fun knock some crack out well you do it everything that can be write can be crack but piss em off in the process goodbye what be the program that will be sell                                                                                                                         george gruschow death do you gronk ag625 yfn ysu edu ggruscho nyx cs du edu
 hello there the other day i be feel a tad nostalgic and thought about construct an old time crytal radio set i figure on substitute a modern germanium diode for the crystal and wind the antenna coil etc  myself the only problem i seem to have be in locate a source for a tune capacitor    you know the old meshed plate variable condenser which use to be the mainstay for tune circuit well these thing seem to be all but extinct in their original catalog habitat trimmer capacitor be relatively abundant but be not really suitable for this application so can anyone point me to a supplier of tune capacitor in the 0    360 pf range manythanks
 greeting recently decide to chuck the linear regulator and learn the    black magic    art of switch power supply     before anyone flame me i know both have their place anyways built the basic up down converter with pretty good result 80 efficiency but run into problem when i try to design build anything that put out serious amp     i know it can be do i have some 5v 200a gut on my bench but something puzzle me use a simple choke a the storage element basicly a toroid with a single wind but all commercial model use transformer with many winding i trace a few and they seem to use some of the wind for the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose me     what be they for well than that anyone have a full schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume my other problem in get high amp good efficiency be 1 lack of source of ideal component calculate and 2 limited knowledge of the whole topic     do this on my own not school mind you in fact i have yet to take any course that cover transistor so be the answer to 1 the accumulation of dead commercial model and truning into a scavanger not that not what do now     and 2 get understand schematic and a bit more of the mind boggling theory take care p s my goal be 12v  25a in car battery 250vac out and on the other end 250v  5vdc 5a  5v 1a  12vdc 8a and  12vdc 1a     the distance between the two will be more than 100 foot of 14 16 gauge but less than 300 foot would like to have a work model in a year or so     do i have a chance to make it

 mike ring be the red wire tip be the green wire of most standard phone line they two constitute the two wire most often use for voice telephone the two live line they be the two innermost connector of an rj 11 phone jack another way of tell be that if you measure voltage from red to green ring to tip tip green be at ground potential of the voltmeter it should read  48 volt in the on hook no ring position i be 98 sure  48 v and not  48 volt hurt a phone too much if reverse just bad if one happens to somehow get ground to earth ground elsewhere additionally when off hook the voltage drop to about  4 to  9 volt dc i think it be suppose to correspond to a 36 to 40 ma current loop and lastly when ring the two wire develop an ac potential of about 80 v p p at 20 to 30 hz across them where you get the electromechanical old fashion bell ringer from

 phototransistor  x100 x100 ne567 with 330kohm limiter feedback to base to control operating point i expect this really hurt noise figure any comment from phototransistor expert we intend to use this atop a stepper motor to provide heading to the beacon the plan be to have 3 or 4 beacon of different frequency in each room and tell the 567 what frequency to phase lock to we do not do so one challenge be that the available stepper have 8 degree step know the heading to each beacon we would have use the surveyor technique of resection to determine robot location no i ai n t go to explain resection over the net

 from    management of electronics assembly    ian oakes after talk about 63 37 tin lead alloy and the eutectic point        occasionally impurity may be add to solder to vary charactersitics within the solder process in an attempt to improve performance for example addition of small quantity of antimony and copper can reduce the amount solder move under stress when solid for particular application addition of impurity may be warrant but in general it be best to keep the solder use in a solder process a pure a possible    i guess this be the good oil for commercial operation but it mention anything esoteric

 i see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the battery however you would have be well off leave them outside keep them cold would have be well for them than bring them inside a warm battery will self discharge faster than a cold one when you be store a battery a good idea to charge it once a month let a battery go completely dead be bad for it i suspect this be what cause your problem
 what i usually use     and this stuff be only good on glass      is either acetone or a little benzene the latter of the two be a bit dangerous possibly a carcinogen sp but it usualy get the job do i imagine you can you the two solvent on most metal a well a glass but keep the stuff away from plastic well yet you may just want to go to your local hardware store and ask them what they use
 rubbish the reason for the colour of the board depends on the solder mask that be use old board bakelite and phenolic rarely use a solder mask these board be not suit well to automatic stuff and solder technique and hence be the colour of the compound use to make them these day board be make of fibreglass for most general purpose us and have a solder mask apply to them to prevent close trace short to one another during solder and also to prevent the decomposition of trace under harsh environment the light and dark green board ofter see have a    dry film    mask apply to them usually apply a a complete film photographically produce the blue and red or orange board be a two part epoxy or a liquid imageable resist formulation and be apply in a different manner there  s a lot of info about the pro  s and con  s of each but another story     sla n go fo ill risky b

 true enough but     zilog scc             rr0 7 break detect this be a very popular part but it have a number of quirk especially in hdlc mode signetics 68562 duscc                               rsr 2 break start detect rsr 3 break end detect two of the bit in the receiver status register you can enable an interrupt on either of these bit go high too also only one null will be put in the fifo per break detect this be simply the best serial chip ever work with _many_ less quirk than the scc which be imho second best death to 8250 device
 the lead acid secondary cell release energy electricity with the follow chemical reaction pb pbo2 2h2so4    2pbso4 2h20 lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water the standard heat of formation at 25 c 77 f of the various compound be heat of formation compound at 25 c kcal mole                                        pb 0 00 pbo2  65 0 h2so4  193 69 pbso4  218 5 h20  68 3174 the heat of reaction at 25 c be therefore  60 6 kcal per mole pbso4 produce note that lead sulfate be not very soluble 0 0048 gram per 100 gram water at 25 c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction be occur or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i be almost sure it be the positive terminal where the precipitate form but i may be wrong oh well i have a corrode battery to corrobate and i feel like think through it right now what be important to notice here be that the reaction a you knew it would be be exothermic or energy discharge if moisture with dissolve electrolyte acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminal may form this will discharge the battery a the chemical reaction proceeds the reaction be reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger be put back into the battery lead acid battery must change in chemical composition to discharge each cell have all the reactant necessary for the reaction the non reacting post terminal of the lead acid battery be there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge because the reaction be exothermic it have a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstance so while keep the battery dry be a good idea it be not a total solution to understand why lead acid battery do indeed discharge faster when store on concrete a oppose to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier s principle which can be paraphrase a anything subject to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position here be the thermal conductivity of a some select material thermal conductivity material temperature c f btu  hr ft ft f ft                                                                      diatomaceous earth 204 0 051 natural across stratum 871 0 077 diatomaceous natural 204 0 081 parallel to stratum 871 0 106 diatomaceous earth powder 100 0 039 density 18 lb cu ft 200 0 042 300 0 044 400 0 048 500 0 051 concrete cinder    0 20 stone    0 54 1 4 dry    0 44 pine across grain 15 0 087 parallel to grain 21 0 20 oak across grain 15 0 12 maple across grain 50 0 11 note that the thermal conductivity for    dirt    diatomaceous earth go down with temperature also 204 c be about 400 k and the value for earth powder be on the same order of magnitude a natural earth the thermal conductivity of concrete be around a factor of 10 great than that of dirt and be 2 4 time great than wood it be these difference in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood at any instant the discharge reaction be occur energy be be release either a electricity or heat thermal conductivity of air be about 0 015 btu  hr ft ft f ft during storage except for the trickle that pass through any condensate on the battery this energy be mostly release a heat the high conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the low conductivity surface thus if you perfectly insulate a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any give battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharge about 10 time faster than that on dirt this be where lechatelier  s principle come into play remove energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction far to completion if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keep the battery at that temperature require the removal of any heat produce a concrete surface be a well heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a pour concrete basement and you have 3 surface remove energy which    pull    the reaction along also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water this will tend to drive the discharge reaction jeff white jhwhit01 ulkyvx louisville edu
 the battery go dead primarily becaust the floor be cold the temperature combine with self discharge promotes sulfation which ruin the plate of the battery i strongly suspect that the only reason the battery go dead a quickly on a dirt surface be because cement tends to be quite cooler
 heat of formation delete the major problem with this be that the reaction take place in an acid solution pbso4 be soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out also h2so4 be in a water solution a 2h30  and so4    thus the heat of formation of pbso4 and h2so4 be for the most part irrelevant a it turn out the reaction be indeed exothermic heat produce more about this later what actually happens to make the battery completely useless be this talk lead acid battery of course the battery slowly self discharge a this discharge take place two thing happen  the level of pb   ion in the acid solution increase i e the lead and lead oxide plate be dissolve  the level of h30  ion in the acid solution decrease i e the solution becomes less acidic or more like water if you like now a the post to which i be respond correctly state pbso4 will precipitate in a water non acid solution when the battery dy i e be fully discharge we end up with a high concentration of pb   and so4    in water so pbso4 form in the solution and fall to the bottom of the battery of course this happens in vary degree the more discharge the more precipitate form the precipitate form a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery if there be enough of the lead and lead oxide plate left to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short result i have see product in automotive shop to correct this condition but they be for the most part useless they can dissolve the pbso4 but can not restore the lead and lead oxide plate properly you may have some success with these product for a newer battery stuff delete stuff delete this stuff be just make up by the author and be completely invalid in fact the discharge reaction take place at a high rate at high temperature a logical consequence of the above argument be this    if you really want your car to start low the battery temperature to  50 to  pull the reaction along    we all know from experience at least those of u in canada do it get cold up here that this be not true if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery besides which there be not enough energy release through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature the air would amply dissipate any such heat whether the bottom of the battery be insulate or not this be of course irrelevant since you would want the battery to be cool during storage

 probably but the point be the company make the registration patch not you sure you can probably find another registerred user and compare note but why not hinder you in any way unless you be just hack problem about people who cut too much from quote     nothing but if you read my whole suggestion say that you register via mail by mail in your registration card then the company send you the patch which include the info you put on the registration card

 with regard to what you write how do one    adjust for room dynamic and stuff like that    i ask a professor that question just last week and he really know himself since pink noise be believe to be due to surface state say the surface of the silicon where there s a lack of a covalent bond that act a    trap    to nearby elecrons and since this happens at low frequency because at high frequency they able to    trap    electron how do you compensate for that it seem to me that you be able to compensate for pink noise i have see the    pink noise    feature however on many eq and i be wonder how they be suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise be not due to    man make noise    like power line crosstalk couple etc if you have any information about this it would be appreciate hope this sound too drawn out thanx

 bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator  s house and ask him for his opinion of what hearing most community you can not do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such schedule if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes if he do then you probably need to have your equipment work on to make it immune to rf interference a a coupld of people have point out this be wrong it be not illegal to record or disclose what you heard on the ham band

 not the concrete floor that do it the problem be that lead acid cell self discharge over time even high quality cell gate for instance will discharge 50 60 over a 3 5 month period of time non sealed cell self discharge even faster if the battery be not completly charge when left sit it probably discharge past the the point where cell sulfiding occurs which in many case mean a ruin battery

 hi i be look an integrate circuit for my z80 based computer the circuit be call z80 sti serial timer interrupt mk3801 and make by mostek mostek be call sg thompson today i have be in contact with sg thompson unfortunately they me told that z80 sti be obsolete so my question be if anyone know if i can get hold of that circuit be there any company that specialize in sell circuit that be no longer in production i have contact several electronic broker in sweden but without any success i would appreciate if you could give me hint where i should continue look even company in the united state would be fine since this circuit be pretty crucial to me thanks in advance
 the first step be to make sure that there be no dc component intentional or not on the audio line to be switch if neither the output or input present an unintentional dc level let  s say capacitively couple then put a 22 k resistor from each input to ground and from the output to ground be a good precaution against leakage in any couple cap present a dc level that be guaranteed to cause a click if the device present an unintentional dc level that be from more than just couple capacitor leakage then you need to remove the dc before switch with couple capacitor of your own if you have more than one relay each relay switch one input through to a common output you can use make before break switch where for a brief instant both source be connect during a switch change this may mask the switch click an audio switch that be clickless be make by take a light bulb and make your own ersatz opto isolator with a light dependent resistor ldr seal inside a piece of black heatshrink many broadcast console use this old but time honored technique claro actually make a complete optisolator like this but i have a part number handy radio shack have a ldr grab bag 276 1657 you might want to try for a simple solid state clickless switch that be cheap you might try look at the cd4066 analog switch that be commonly available or it old predecessor the 4016 again the dc component must be remove prior to switch other alternative include jfet switch both discrete and ic and diode switch which work relatively well surprisingly all the above with their pitfall and application tip could easily make a subject for a multi page article solid state switch may induce a click of their own when turn on due to charge be inject into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal change state technique to minimize this include lower the impedance of the signal path through the switch differential switch and slow the risetime of the control pulse with the 4016 cut the click can be a simple a put 10k 47k resistor in series with the control pin hope this help at least get you start                                                                                                          dave medin phone 205 730 3169 w ssd    networking 205 837 1174 h intergraph corp  m s gd3004 internet dtmedin catbyte b30 ingr com huntsville al 35894 uucp     uunet ingr b30 catbyte dtmedin         everywhere you look at least around my office

 there be several type of copy protection and the point be to make sure the user be use a legitimate copy the simplest and virtually fool proof way be for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it be instal on some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a different machine not instal from original disk will not work the program be definitely backupable if restore to the same machine depends on the programmer     use a disk drive characteristic if the user do an upgrade to the machine he she should reinstall all program any way no document look up no disk wear and tear i do not say that the original would allow only one install the user  s conscience should do that i know i  ll get flame for this     but with the increase number of    casual    user who either unknowingly or care about the software copyright the truth i have    friend    who ask me for copy of my late game all the time and when i refuse they go after somebody else casual pirate be become more of a problem some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying see what some of my    friend    dug up somewhere     late and the great game all crack within day of actual release you know how many byte you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz two yes two and ask me which one they be determine pirate be unstoppable give enough time but their result do not spread that far since pirate board be not that well known and easily tracked once found by authority it be the    casual    pirate that the copy protection be determine to discourage what i believe the company should do be implement the above plus a special patch once the user register that loudly exclaims upon bootup    register to xxxxx    address city state zip    and disables the above two benefit 1 encourages registration 2 cut down on pirate and make it more traceable because if the patch  s registration message be encrypt it will be quite hard to change and therefore provide a stable trail of who allow their copy out of their hand and thus violate their license agreement this way the legitimate user who do not register will experience minimal discomfort who do major upgrade to their computer frequently a only problem they have be they be able to restore to another computer the register user would have proven they be legitmate user and therefore gain full right and can restore to different machine on the other hand the software company now have a record of where this particular copy be suppose to be if this user  s copy be found to be somewhere it be not suppose to be we know who have broken their license agreement of course a hacker can break that eventually but not the point be it

 i know for sure that the everex magic i o ev 170a can be jumpered for a printer mode or for a general purpose bidirectional i o mode also i know for sure that the ibm technical reference say the follow about the monochrome display printer adapter and the ibm parallel printer adapter it be essential that the external device not try to pull these line refer to the data line to ground and later if an external device should be drive data on these pin in violation of usage ground rule at the time of an input this data will be or ed with the latch content i will accept no responsibility if you incur damage of any kind a a result of my say    i do not know for sure but i think you should be able to use a traditional parallel port a an input port by write 0x to the data line and then reading from the data line while an external device drive them    the input data will not be latch so noise could make this infeasible

 the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it be a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate why the old wife tale of sit it on a piece of wood on the floor work to help keep from kill the battery a fast       it insulates the battery thermally it set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will self discharge even slow the best thing would be to attach a small load such a a small transistor radio with the volume turn down low and leave it on constantly but also trickle charge it every couple day too to    shallow  cycle    the charge in the battery such mild    exercise    of a lead acid battery be the next best thing to completely remove the electrolyte for storage if you do remove the electrolyte may sure you keep separate storage container for each cell  s electrolyte and put it back into the same cell when you refill the battery this so critical for a brand new battery in a fully charge state but will maximize the restore output of an old battery which may not be fully charge when you remove the electrolyte for storage

 yes but still not a 6502 for those difference same instruction set of course yes the same number but an entirely different device i should have qualify this far by state that this be the pal version of the tia i be not 100 sure that the ntsc tia would have a different number do anyone on the net actually have detail of the tia a this be the only device i have not yet discover detail about atari australia when ask claimed that their attempt to get the programmer documentation for the 2600 have fail a the u head office have refuse to provide it i saw a couple of cheaper device with pn2222  s and a couple of resistor hooked up a a cheap inverter nasty but workable and cheaper than a 7404 inverter if labor cost almost nothing
 why do a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when store on a concrete floor it could be that you store it somewhere that it could become cover by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminal the same thing happens to my car citroen 2cv    damp get under the bonnet u    hood    and short the spark plugs to earth so it start the solution for the car be to clean the plug lead and spray with wd 40 moisture repellant if damp  is  the problem then store the battery off the ground may help not sure if spray with wd 40 would be safe since it be very flammable high percentage petroleum just a thought     chris

 i thought the first thread be hilarious so here go another post some more background information on what have happen to my poor battery one year i left the battery in the garage the garage be unheated they be left in their place that they need to be one in the rid lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the rid lawnmower be about 3 4 year old and one of the cycle battery be new and one be around 5 year old upon spring time i discover that all of the battery be dead and need to be recharge they all work properly except for the old one and they have to be replace about halfway through the summer they have originally be store in the garage and i think i remember my dad charge them in spring last year i decide to bring them in to the basement which have two part one be dirt and brick and the other be concrete i brought in all three and discover in the spring about 15 day ago that not only be the battery dead but when i put the charger on them the charger say    hmmmmmmmm    and the amp meter read around 1 000 000 000 in other word it be pin the internal circut tripped and i go on to the other battery they be the same realize that we still have 2 gigantic sailboat battery also lead acid i decide to put the charger on them these have be sit for around 1 and a half year on the brick and dirt part and notice that they only need a small charge around 2 hour or so on trickle i test them by use them at the local gas station for give jump start and they work fine for around 25 of  em this lead me to believe one of several thing 1 i bought really tty battery last year sorta true 2 the concrete have something to do with the discharge of the battery 3 there be enough moisture to short out the terminal in the room where the concrete be 4 the dirt room be able to absorb the moisture in the air well than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room
 there be a number of inaccuracy here 1 in fact a colder battery will self discharge more slowly this be why battery should be store in a cool dry place 2 an battery place on concrete do not become colder than one place on wood the battery the wood and the concrete will all be at the same general temperature ignore temperature fluctuation and thus none will effect the other there be no need to  exercise the battery just keep it charge a trickle charger will do the job

 oh yes the good ol deutsche bundespost shortly after move to germany someone told me that    post    be an acronym for the    public organization for the suppression of technology    stimmt oder i miss a lot of thing about germany yes include the bier vend machine at work that be subsidize by the firm but the phone system be not one of them
 it sorta depends on what you drive i remember run a two channel motorola with a vibrator power supply and about 40 tube in a 1958 volkwagen the poor little 6 v generator have a heck of a time and if you keyed the mic at night you need to be stationary because your light get awful dim progress wonderful
 we use it a start fluid for jet ski  s the fact that it a lubricant work very well since jet ski  s be 2 cycle it also help when a ski flood with water because we clean the spark plus with the stuff ob sci electronics i have an office studio in my garage with a phone in it our wireless phone have a page feature where you can make the phone or hand set ring to get the attention of the other person be there a simple circuit that i can use over the second pair of wire or the first pair to emulate this effect with the phone in the garage ie push a button to make the phone ring in the house or push a button to make it ring in the garage thanks xavier
 hey can someone clue me in on these and other weird type of amplifier just a brief intro to the concept behind these would be cool i have the clue on type a b and ab already and stuff but these other one be mention occasionally and i dont know what they do i think type d be like a pwm scheme or something thanx in advanced
 most commercial switcher do not use magnetics for their energy storage handle by the big cap on the primary side those which in a linearly regulated power supply would be consider the    filter    cap come right after the bridge the transformer be just that a transformer there primarily to step the voltage up or down although the inductance see by the switch transistor on the primary side be not negligible a anyone who  s zapped say transistor from either fail to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglect to include a    snubber    diode across it would tell you actually many transistor intend for switcher use today have the diode built in the basic switched mode power supply operates something like this in a somewhat simplify manner the ac line be rectify to produce a high voltage more or less unregulated dc rail the energy storage or    filter    cap appear across this rail a do the switch transistor the transistor chop the current into the primary side of the transformer result in stepped up or stepped down pulse out the secondary which be then rectify and filter at least one of the transformer  s output be sample and fed back to the control circuit for the switch transistor which act in a    pulse width modulation    pwm fashion to control by vary the pulse width the amount of energy be dumped into the primary and therefore the voltage come out at the secondary the remain output may be allow to simply run at whatever value they will more or less track the regulate output or they may have some additional linear regulation add you may also note that the feedback between the regulate output and the pwm control which be most typically an ic be not do via a direct electrical connection this be due to various safety standard which require primary and secondary circuit to be electrically isolated often the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement while the transformer the primary energy storage device in these design this do not mean that the energy store in the transformer can be ignore besides the inductive    kick    give the switch transistor a bad time a note above you also need to worry about get all the energy that go  in  to the transformer back  out  again one way or another in some design this happens more or less automatically but in others you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core saturate which again would have disastrous result best left to the imagination not by any stretch of the imagination a power supply designer hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross error in the above
 what be people  s opinion about laser detector escort make a laser detector the passport 1000 and claim it work fine however talk to some people who have say that it will only work if you be lucky i e if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your detector otherwise it work regular radar of course travel in all direction hence it be more detectable any comment escort have a deal till the end of april i think where if you buy their wideband passport 3200 x k ka and laser detector save 60 off of buying them separately in this case the addition of the laser detector over the passport 3200 be only 40 i e passport 1000 normally cost 100    eddie gornish university of illinois center for supercomputing research development
 if you can modify the design of the dtmf decoder the ideal comunications would be over a multi drop system like rs 485 rs 485 board be available for pc  s probably cheaper than a bunch of rs 232 channel and rs 485 be cheaper to build onto your satellite module use only a single supply 8 pin dip driver chip software at the pc end would be similarly complex for either rs 232 or rs 485 in my opinion the high data rate possible with rs 485 would permit quasi simultaneous data transmission hope this help
 just saw an article in new scientist at t videophones talk to bti videophones the at t one use a 19 2kb modem bti us 14 4kb at t model have to communicate use all at t exchange whereas the bti can route via most current exchange suggestion include building standard converter into telephone exchange the mind boggles the bti design be a bit more conservative and be well able to cope with current data compression hardware on long distance line not have the magazine to hand i may have mis remembered bti i think it be a british one make by gec marconi and currently sell to other country yet another standard screw up

 this be not a good idea   i upgraded my motherboard last fall i would have be quite piss at any software that would have force me to reinstall simply because i change motherboards any info in the bios be too volatile to use a a checksum be you go to require that a user re install all their software if they add 4mb of ram to their computer i do that a couple of week ago in the bios and if software have told me    this the machine you instal me on    i would never have use that software again really bad idea this be silly much easy to loan disk to a friend and let them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk and then give them that your scheme go to stop anyone do you know any assembly language at all all anyone need to do if find the part of the code that do the quiz and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it not that difficult really and there be very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing use pklite or some similar utility would help but only if the result compress  exe be tag a uncompressable this be by far the best idea you present in your post make it plainly obvious who register be go to stop casual pirate but the determine one be just go to answer    joe blow    to the question of    what  s your name    so this stop them in the long run pirate be always go to win this fight they simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme    steve madsen sjmadsen nextsrv cas muohio edu

 why do all posting from bnr seem to have bogus address both gstovall crchh67 nosubdomain nodomain and gstovall bnr com bounce     this make it rather difficult to reply     they go through uunet this be often the problem a uunet often have problem with return path     delete     oh and most importantly no amount of transmit rf short of a transmitter the size of small house be likely to cause the equipment failure you describe so you be look at two different problem yep
 what kind of power must he be put out to cause the effect the affected equipment be about 100 foot from the road     might be a couple of hundred watt from the sound of it kick sound out of the tv and stereo speaker by direct rf rectification require a mighty strong carrier heard of linears so powerful that trigger them while the car be idle would stall the engine by pull down the battery voltage it would take a lot more than that it sound like the radio equipment be actually not shut completely off but just go to a standby situation i suspect that the story be just that story the voltage can only be suck down so far instantaneously when you try to jumpstart someone car when your vehicle be at idle do your car stall no the other car just do not crank well now the engine might stall because the idle be too low to start with when the extra current be drawn the idle speed will drop a the alternator load down the engine to compensate for the increase amperage requirement be resolution of this problem a matter for the power company the fcc or both ultimately likely to be your problem to resolve afraid the fcc be so understaffed that they pay much attention to citizen complains about rfi or so heard     just send you a pamphlet describe how you can apply corrective measure talk to the power company might help they might be able to install filter device at your service panel or recommend a type which you could have instal by a license electrician a transmitter be not go to be affect house power if surge be occur there it be due to another cause not a transmitter unfortunately there  s a fair chance that enough signal be be picked up by your house wiring that a simple service panel filter suffice you may need to install heavy duty rfi filter at the power connection of your affected equipment it be probably not that much of a problem often toroid coil on the power lead will solve that part of the interference problem it will not solve internal equipment deficiency if the problem occurs regularly you may need to    stake out    the street in question and watch for truck or car with big antenna drive by at the time interference occurs if you can identify the vehicle which be transmit you may be able to contact it owner and complain it be probably not the transmitter that be at fault if the person be an amateur then he she will probably be willing to help if you explain that the person be cause interference

 nope your problem be either be cause by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator or just plain not have enough power i would suspect that those amp be go to draw a lot of current on short peak you can try use large and shorter cable to the generator or try strap the amp for 240v service and run 240v main cable out which will minimize the line drop if these work though go to need a big generator i assume that use well maintained generator and have watch the voltage output on the generator properly if you have 120v come out of the unloaded generator never get 120v at the other end
 the curiosity that you speak of be el electro luminescent pad they be mostly use a backlights for lcd  s and a you point out come in several different color many of them emit white ish color    true    white and blue whiteis blue be the one that personally encounter the most often they vary in their input requirement however they tend to operate at about 100 vrms and at much high than 60 hz 400 hz to 1 khz if i recall correctly you can get them to work at 120 vrms 60 hz i e  line but they glow a brightly and they will degrade much faster oh yes almost forgot el  s have this tendency to wear out over time

 back in high school i use to work for a detail company and one of the service we offer be an engine cleaning remove all that oil before you sell the car     unfortunately we do not have a high pressure washer so we would use one several mile from the shop on more than one occasion after wash the engine it would not start a water would have gotten under the distributor i would put a plastic bag around it to try and minimize this around the spark plug wire etc and it would be nearly impossible to try and wipe all these area down with a dry rag the usual solution be to carry a can of wd 40 and when the car start to spray all the likely area and it would then start on the very first time it may be a myth but it certainly kept me from be strand at a car wash

 look for a circuit that will flash an lead on in response to the output from a walkman cassette player how could i do this i want it just to turn on i want it to  strobe once so to speak per every beep i put on a cassette tape would it be well to use a circuit base on the volume of the beep on the cassette or well for the led to respond to a tone of a certain frequency be there any easy way to do either of these look for the simplest circuit possible i guess what ask for be some sort of color organ but not quite let me trt to explain again     go to have a pattern of beat or beep on a cassette tape so on the tape hear beep pause beep pause beep pause   etc with speed increase a time go on i want to synchronize an lead probably two of them with the beep on the cassette tape so the lead with each beep would go on and off real quick generate a strobe light sort of effect the rapidity of the beep on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the led and if there be no sound on the tape except for background his the led would remain off please help thanks

 what you remove it unless you register you get ta be joking right what happens if i get a demo version of that program install it and then decide that i like it do i have to register to be able to get rid of it hell no that be the last thing i would think of if that be what you mean then you would well make pretty sure that a statement to that effect be print loud and clear on the package a well way to implement the above mention scheme be imho to allow anyone to install the program but if they register they get some additional feature enable it could mean only one new  exe file need to be copy to have get the full version of the program of course anyone be _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever time they like still we face the trouble of  moving the new  exe file around that could be solve by have the user register him self and get back a specially marked for him or her a new  exe file a for some sort of limitation here be some suggestion limit the size of data that the program can work with disable save the data print it out with some defect in the output but be sure to mark them a such let some pop up screen appear for ca 10 sec when the program be start and or exit etc     but do n t have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it
 acetone will likely damage the carpet first solvent to try be denature alcohol do not waste your time with rub alcohol you can use methyl alcohol instead of denature alcohol if you want to have a cocktail while you be remove the goo use pure grain alcohol if the alcohol do not work try carbon tetrachloride if neither of these work you may need to try a strong solvent but the alcohol work for most adhesive good luck
 pretty high frequency for one chip     yes and no i would use the fm transmitter chip from motorola linear and interface databook a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer e g sbl 1 from mini circuit lab everything be do in the fm chip and then mixed up with the oscillator frequency just have a look at the arrl handbook there be lot of idea in there about oscillator and mix i think there be single chip design for such high frequency yet cheer robert hb9nby
 yes it have to be very clear like it there and of course cost be always a factor i be try to get an idea of the feasability of such an idea but i want to give too much away
 when try to choose a resistor with a tolerance well than 1 you need a trimmer or to screen device it be make from add 2 resitors of 1 value in parallel since the small device will have the error of 1 to cope with you have 3 choice a live with the error of 1 tolerance device for low q circuit or low sensitivity design b buy resistor with well than 1 tolerance vishay dale c use trimmer or sot  s select on test
 mistaken they exist the semiconductor be silicon carbide and they be inefficient and expensive the bandgap be around 2 7 ev the one i have be clear plastic pray tell what would make a    typical    lead emit blue light
 yes it do all the equipment have to have that telekom approval number to be legal what have change be that you can buy the equipment somewhere else pretty sure the same hold true in sweden at least when i read some information on it about tweo year ago and btw i do know that most of the line in sweden can handle tone dialing just be sure that all can
 two thing to watch for in germany and i think the same hold for sweden only some of the connection can handle tone dial so make sure the phone can be set to pulse dial in sweden the 0 be the first digit and all other digit be push    down    by one position this make dial and in the process convert number an interest task otherwise it be technically no problem to connect a foreign phone to either the german or swedish phone system otoh neither you nor i would ever try that a it be of course illegal
 yup not all that difficult to do the panasonic cartridge bad but they spectacular mount it on the side call up crown the company that have the patent on the pzm and ask them for information on construction and use of the thing you may have to determine the correct space emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the design of the panasonic cartridge us a tune cavity in front of the electret element to increase the high frequency response and you be go to be alter the resistance through the cavity entrance crown have a nice book on the subject though unfortunately rather short on mathematics there  s a jaes article from many year back too

 for those who be interested the fcc do indeed care about cable leakage particularly into the aviation nav band or leakage that be    cause interference to other service    part 76 611 detail specific limit to acceptable leakage and measurement technique if you will clearly document your problem and measurement technique a signal level meter with dipole be the normal approach remember to correct between measurement data and microvolt per meter and fax or mail the detail to mr  john wong cable branch fcc 1919 m st  nw wash dc and a copy of your letter to the local cable company you will get result in fact the cable company will probably start treat you much well when they realize you have figure out how to get the fcc attention what be important be to document your case a it relates to the applicable rule however the cable company  is required  to at least check out every complaint of leakage they must file with the commission and maintain on premise a yearly measurement report that detail the result of leakage test but remember call the cable company first and give them a chance to work to correct the problem before contact the commission i be in the business of measure cable system leakage via the airborne method
 there be a cartridge cap upgrade for old deskjet printer available from hewlett packard old original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 unit may have a black plastic slide with rubber cap component in the cartrige parking area on the right side view from front of the printer newer printer have a gray or white plastic slide the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out there be and may still be information package with ink cartridge explain the situation hp place a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new cap mechanism i do this on my printer and do indeed find that the cartidges now last longer i have the information handy i suggest contact your near hp service center for information on obtain the kit hp have upgrade kit that consist of electronics and mechanical component that vary depend on the start level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500  the kit be fairly expensive you be likely well off sell your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that price have decline so much upgrade an original deskjet to 500 require a fair amount of skill but no solder upgrade a deskjet plus to a 500 be involves swap the processor card and change a few minor part contact your hp service center for far information the pcl language use by deskjets be considerably different from the pcl use by laser printer especially the newer laser printer the big problem be dumb laser driver that send a raster end command after each scan line this make no material difference for laser but cause the deskjet to print the accumulate raster a you might guess the result be hideously slow printing the new do wordperfect print deskjet driver be still guilty of this particular behavior from the way wordperfect work this would not be easy to change window wordperfect work efficiently unless you use the do driver instead of window the pcl4 dialect use in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permit a full page 300 dpi image to be render with only one megabyte of memory an uncompressed image could be a large a about 909 kbytes but the printer need about 300k of memory for it internal house keeping laserjet iv model support band printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situation deskjet downloadable font be not compatible with laserjet font a single page from a laserjet only require about 20 second this be faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer the presumption of course be that the laser printer have complete it warm up cyle until ink chemistry be change wicking result in image deterioration be unavoidable i use the word impossible but match laser quality output from a deskjet printer be unlikely chosing an appropriate paper type help but do not eliminate the problem laser printer be more wastful of energy and consumable component hp do accept return of spent toner cartridge mitigate the material waste problem to a degree energy waste could use more work warm up time have decrease allow stand by current consumption to be significantly reduce in the laserjet iv kyocera produce a laser print engine that employ an amorphous silicon image drum with a replacable toner system the image drum be good for approximately 100k copy it be a very nice print engine i wish hp use the kyocera engine kyocera also have a neat modular paper source and stacker system the recommend duty cycle for a deskjet be significantly low than any of hp  s laser printer the pick up pressure roller be subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out the usual symptom be that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper the paper feed be integrate in a transport mechanism that be a single part from hp service replacement cost for the transport be almost 200 the feed roller be not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician i have disassemble and reassemble the transport on my own printer it depends upon the application which printer be best for you if you only print 5 or 10 page a day and be satisfied with the appearance of output the deskjet be a very good choice a note the deskjet 500 be my choice for personal use

 i have see the existance of electronics solder with a 2 silver content that seem to have good wet and fatique reatings can anyone tell me why it be not use silver be not such an expensive metal andy for the most part silver solder be not use for general solder task due to the mechanism of dendritic growth silver solder when expose to high humidity and place in an electric field will actually grow dendrite which be conductive and will adventually electrically short across closely space node which be create the field for this reason silver be allow only in hermetically seal assembly fortunatly tin lead solder be quite stable and will not grow dendrite a fast a silver solder therefore it be use extensively jerry long

 be in the    visualization    stage of a circuit design right now i be wonder what the best way to    scale    an ac voltage use an 8 bit digital word be i be think of use the common method of send the word through an adc and then compare it with the ac voltage convert to a sawtooth wave to get a duty cycle however i be leary of this method because it a require a lot of part and more importantly b creates a lot of interference from the switch on the entire ac line i realize that correct filter could cancel out most of this interference but that would require more part and boost the price far someone mention to me that they have see an ic which input 8 bit of data and directly scale the ac voltage come in all on chip unfortunately he remember the chip number or the manufacturer if anyone else have heard of this chip please e mail me i be building this project a a    dimmer box    for a light controller circuit and it be important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer be require for each light that the user wish to control well each channel at least therefor if each box cost 150 i doubt that an end user will want to dish out 150 x 16 2400 for sixteen channel     this be something i have notice about today  s dimmer box they be so expensive anyway any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily do this or info about the chip which will do it for me always the prefer method     will be greatly appreciate

 to put it bluntly they be full of it pay a tape be play a tape there be no difference whether the output go to a second vcr or to a tv how the vcr or tv reacts to this signal be a different story see message pertain to macrovision copy protection in order for the tape to self destruct it would have to have circuitry of it own within the tape case the circuit would have to somehow magically determine what the output of the vcr be connect to the circuit would then have to have an erase head to actually do anything it be a pretty lame scare tactic see something similar on a bb when the sysop want to he could have a message sent to the user  s end say that it be send the code to format your hd

 uh bob why be the battery warmer than ground temperature on the time scale in question and with the considerably reduce temperature swing several foot underground there go to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what sit on because the temperature of your hand  unlike that of the battery  be determine by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss feel the great rate of heat loss from an object your hand which be kept much warmer than it surroundings in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production this will affect how quickly it come into equilibrium with it surroundings if it start out not in equilibrium with them but affect the final temperature for the same reason windchill affect whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze

 well yes and no the _image_ be on the screen less than 1 30 of a second but a _mixture_ of image about 90 of the field that be suppose to be there and 10 of the  subliminal addition could be overlaid for one field produce the same overall effect to our sluggish retina of a discrete image project for 1 300 second   although like the previous poster i have to reserve my doubt about the effectiveness of say discrete image in steer my subconscious around

 hmmm     a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software be sell the clerk stick it in the store pc and asks for the buyer id later if pirate version show up they could be tracked to the original purchaser in addition copy which be sent to distributors stores would have a vendor reg or serial in order to track in store piracy possible additional program security scheme would be 1  have monthly password change which necessitate user call in and registration inconvenient 2  take dire legal action on anyone caught expensive 3  encryption crc check self modify code limited effectiveness 4  have an independent watchdog program in the installation setup config or memory manager etc which would check the main program  s crc only a effective a above method at best 5  have the above watchdog circulate a a virus which would trash crack copy of the program and or the offender hard drive risky and probably illegal certainly immoral my new idea terribly feasible to implement a present but i thought if i threw them out people could think of variation that might be effective what be the problem with parallel port security key i use anything that have hardware key copy protection scheme so i know what the drawback be i know the company that make them claim uncrackable but see crack of autodesk 3d studio float around i have one so ask and i have heard that it have parralel port key
 ti only a gleam in my eye at this point i have yet to chose a track method the initial requirement be to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zone across the stage i do some experiment with pyroelectric detector and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition and dancer stand still alot so their ir signature go away the good thing about pryoelectrics be that their signal be proportional to the size of the warm body or body part and the velocity of say body this could be useful for detect the intensity of a dance gesture dancer also really hate to wear little box and battery strap on their body but they really need to be emit some kind of signal to be tracked
 not only be benzene a carcinogen it be adsorbed through the skin and cause cumulative damage to the bone marrow which be essential to the production of your blood cell it be highly toxic one exposure be unlikely to kill you but it will likely do hidden damage benzene be one compound that chemist try like hell to avoid use acetone be much less toxic but be highly flammable and volatile it also dissolve lot of thing so handle with great care
 i think it a great but idealistic idea a reseacher will first of all try to publish a worthy paper in a credible professional magazine and not in a community like usenet which be infamous for lot not all of junk information the paper that will be    publish    here will in general be of low quality also it be improbable that any credit will be give to a researcher who publish here and sadly that be nowadays a main reason for publishing usenet be great for informal discussion and free exchange of idea keep it like that a new specialist group be just not worth it

    for my computer law module i have be ask to write a computer contract for the supply of computer software to a business the software be be especially write for the company would anyone per chance happen to have a copy of a computer contract on their system which they could mail me if anyone have a computer contract but it contains sensitive material then i can assure them that it will remain confidential and i will not pas it on or allow anyone else to view it thanks
 subject say it all though i should specify that look for solution that do n t require me purchasing specific chip etc     in other word be there some sort of neural network circuit i could build after a visit to a local r shack
 can you help me to understand how a cardphone operates and how the value be store on the phonecard
 charlie brett  s suggestion    buy one of the disposable flash camera use the film then take the thing apart    be a good one note though that you get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing and it may be a single point design that adapt well to off nominal operation the thing be easy to dismantle the key piece of information be that when you advance the film on one of them you be wind it  into  the film cassette    it be unwound from the cassette in the factory when the camera be make so no darkroom be need for dismantle standard film so just take the cassette in for processing all the camera store people do when you bring in one of the disposable be rip it apart toss the film cassette into the to be processed bin and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another if you take it apart yourself you get an aa alkaline battery still with a fair bit of life in it and all kind of little bit and piece from the camera i expect you could even re load and re use the camera if you be really determine
 yet another suggestion but this one be non toxic although i would handle it like any other cleaner and it smell nice the chemical be call d limonene and it smell like lemon peel i think it be a lemon extract of some kind you might find it in a hardware store sell a a general purpose solvent but your best bet would be any bike store    it be use a a chain cleaning fluid it work on sticker glue crayon grease oil etc clear yellow in the bottle and you can use it straight if you add water it change to a creamy consistency which be good for some job
 when construct active filter odd value of resistor be often require i e something like a 3 14 k ohm resistor it seem best to choose common capacitor value and cope with the strange resistance then demand be there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance give fix resistor of the standard 12 value per decade 1 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 2 3 3 etc it be a common enough problem yet i cant recall see a program that tell that rx ry  rz give rq start with q and find prefer value x y and z

 sorry about follow up my own article but i want to continue that what might be be miss here be that the important thing might not be temperature difference per se but the action of heat sinking the battery perhap someone could conduct an experiment take two identical lead acid battery place both on wooden shelf but put one of them in a water bath design to act a a heat sink this would eliminate the  concrete floor effect and keep both battery at the same ambient temperature i think the argument over temperature be not pertinent but the one over heat conductance and remove the exothermic heat may have some validity

 i hope david go to be too upset with me for stick my nose in here again but here go         it the average temperature that be the key factor here but rather which be well at transfer the heat out of the presumably warmer than ground temperature battery call it a question of thermal conductivity or of insulate ability or    thermal mass    whatever you like question why do a concrete floor feel cooler than the surround dirt when you place your hand on it
 one not so quick question to throw out there for you guy     for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the follow spec voltatge adjustable from 1 12v current  limited  at 1a voltage must stay within 2 of designate value for i from 0 1a ac ripple less than 5 mv rms to decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of the limiter current and the allow temp drift in the first case you can use a ube of a transistor a a voltage reference of about 0 7 vdc with a temp drift of 2mv k in the second case it well you use a bandgap ref and a opamp circuit to detect the maximum current the output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current
 i catch your post one year ago but i presume you like to leave out an extra a latch i presume you allready know there be a  573 but that couldnt be the question could it during my student trainee project i discouvered a nice device a psd301 from waferscale integration in one single 44 plcc i think it be package it contain rom ram i o line and a programmable addressdecoder     a far a i can recall it can be hooked directly with a mcs 51 series up     neat huh but it need program before assembly so it suitable for my project perhaps usefull for you future plan
 back in high school i work a a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental psychologist at bell lab when they be do visual perception and memory experiment they use vector type display with 1 millisecond refresh rate common so your case of 1 200th sec be quite practical and the experimenter be probably sure that it be 5 millisecond not 4 or 6 either steve

 i be not a battery expert but from recent reading a lead acid battery will self discharge at a relatively high rate and if store in a discharge state will develop a condition i think be call sulfation in storage either the electrolyte should be remove and replace for use fat chance ever do that at home or the battery should be store on a trickle charge i have also i think read that the condition may be reversable if hooked up to a current limited charge circuit fro a long period of time the refernce i remember be to use c 50 where c be the amp hour a the charge circuit and leave it hooked up for week some of this may only apply to gel type cell but i suspect the same applies to the liquid type

 the 200cd be one of three oscillator that hp make many year ago the others be the low frequency oscillator and the wide range oscillator these be the one with the 7    diameter chrome dial a wein bridge circuit that use pilot light a the feedback loop and firebottles that produce many volt of output just acquire a pair of these venerable old beast the non working one sn 605 own by crosley radio at one point need help i know i can likely buy a microfiche copy of the book from hp but that cost     and consider i paid a dollar for the pair in the rain at the dayton hamvention
 gee how about an ahem    accelerometer    such device be available from a variety of source one that come to mind be bruel kjaer if you have a lot of money to spend most of these sort of device output a voltage proportional to acceleration you need to know what range talk about though
 the green layer be a solder mask and be use to make a finish board look neat and to avoid solder bridge especially when use wave solder or any other mechanize approach see red mask but most that see be green a bakelite board will look brown in colour and if the solder mask be put on look like a brown board with green  paint on either side or just one side of the board a fibreglass board will look green from the side because the green solder mask make the board appear that colour if you get a fibreglass board with no mask it would be a whitish grey colour teflon board do exist a well     but not sure about that one
 marvin minsky hi there writes of building    perceptrons    in the 1950s use motor driven potentiometer to vary the weight he report that the circuit work even tho there be wiring error can you say robust cadium sulfide cell vary with light cmos or ttl gate provide the sigmoid somewhat linear yet somewhat limiter transfer function often use low power schottky gate and earlier gate have about a gain of x8 led probably output enough light to easily control cd cell even at a few ma and paper with dark and light region control by pencil and eraser could also control cd resistance the very high input resistance of cmos gate may let you charge up 1uf paper mylar cap to serve a memory
 just mho but i prefer hardcopy book because you can have three or four of them open spread across the bed next to the desk in my dorm and reference them while use the program full screen the window help thing come closest to good on line documentation see but they generally detailed enough and would probably take a large amount of space even compress which be at a premium on my system    in fact the manual be the primary reason i bought borland  s c   compiler instead of use the one the lab license in the lab of course get a shelf full of book to help me out when stuck to each his own destroyed about six set of original microsoft word for mac 5 0 and word for window may have be a bad batch of disk have the faintest idea what happen to them they just go bad store near any magnetic field or otherwise mistreat indeed they be only use once give this and the massive headache find a work set of disk to fix some of the machine that periodically go down say have work backup be a godsend i sure wish have them sometimes i think murphy  s law hold true more often than newton  s when we need them i think sortof like snake antivenin 99 995 of the time you have absolutely no use for it but when you need it boy do you ever need it i have backup of my original at    home    but then my machine see anywhere near the use abuse of these here at the lab and so i consider it less of a risk still i usually make    work copy    of them when i install them and then eventually re use these    work copy    for something else    just mine too btw before anyone notice my mention    copying    program from machine to machine when we do installs here and wonder about the licensing the upper management non student staff of course be meticulous in check with provider of the software and make sure we be stick to the license agreement
 wonder if possible to use radio wave to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver seem to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance this would be for short distance 2000 ft and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inch or so                               you might try look at whats available in laser locate system they work best for close work 1 mile and under rf be use for much longer distance in two major mode transponder and phase measurment transponder require you send a pulse to another station and it return it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the receiver time phase measurement require two or more transmit station send the same frequency signal multiplexed in time a receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signal map can be drawn that plot the line of position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two station

 they do interpolate not linear interpolation though you be correct that the frequency content be not alter more specifically the baseband spectrum be preserve and so be every nth image spectrum the other n 1 in n image spectrum be remove where n be the oversampling rate ideally the filter have a gain of 1 from 0hz to 22050hz and a gain of 0 from 22050 to the new nyquist frequency in practice a finite transition band be require and there be also a certain amount of pass band ripple and stop band leakage with a high order eg 200 tap digital filter a very good approximation can be easily achieve bit delete about observation of interpolation filter at work no they actually use a digital fir just like yours but built in hardware on custom vlsi chip for mainly economic reason i guess that the answer be somewhere between the two a an interest aside some of you out there may be aware of a scheme use by pioneer and wadia which be call by pioneer at least legato link i heard one of these player but by reading advertising blurb and a couple of pseudo technical article i deduce that all they do be build a lousy digital oversampling filter and let a load of the first image ie aliassed spectrum through talk to bob stuart of boothroyd stuart aka meridian confirm my suspicion he say that it sound awful but then he would he     christopher

 wonder if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me to sweden and germany dc power and i can buy a special adapter for that in europe the question be if the general electronics work the same i can buy a different wall plug and refit it sure have to but would that do the trick two thing to watch for in germany and i think the same hold for sweden only some of the connection can handle tone dial so make sure the phone can be set to pulse dial in sweden the 0 be the first digit and all other digit be push    down    by one position this make dial and in the process convert number an interest task otherwise it be technically no problem to connect a foreign phone to either the german or swedish phone system otoh neither you nor i would ever try that a it be of course illegal a the phone us dtmf dial which by some magic all telecom operator seem to have agree on this be a complete non issue i think there be any switch in sweden that handle dtmf dial most switch be now digital and tho that have be retrofit with    magic finger    that convert from dtmf to pulse dial thomas
 where can i buy blinking led besides radio shack do anyone sell blinking led with variable flash rate by voltage i guess if so what hertz pulse rate be they adjustable or set to like blinking led that can be set for approx 5 hz 10 hz 15 hz or 20 hz something like that     interested in what s out there for flash rate i like the idea of led with flasher circuit already in them i hate solder ic in general guess i have a hell of a lot of patience thanks
 much delete about assembly in usa vs  other i wish to focus on the subject of warm running amplifier there be a correclation between warm running amp and good sound or in your word    it do have a bearing on        now i suggest that everyone run out and create combination stove amplifiers that will degrade lifespan but a cold running circuit be much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than be a warm running one and since junction resistance be a function of temperature this have a detrimental effect on linearity a few fact  bias point vary with temperature  junction resist varrie with temp  adcom product do not run class a if you still beleive this assertion consider the warm up requirement for most good test equipment or well yet just listen to an amplifier warm up on many design it quite audible on mine about 20 minute for the output stage many hour for the driver fortunately the driver be not switch in any experiment or when draw conclusion from listen betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias idle current level both have a positive correlation with low distortion and    good    sound quality and high bias result in warmer operation all other factor be equal

 check the station  s master sync generator probably find that it already have horizontal and vertical drive output that just be use a couple of cable and in business another possibility be to find a genlockable sync generator with hd and vd output genlock it to station sync and then feed hd and vd to the camera if neither of these be possible then have to build a sync separator look at the circuit diagram of your exist sync generator they probably all include circuitry that do what you want

 i know of at least one ftp site from which you can download the crack of about any commercial game in existence the name of the company yes company be also blatantly advertised with the crack code accord to them it be not illegal at least in the usa accord to a statute or something to remove the copy protection from any program the only condition be that you may only use this code on legally own software for your own convenience if there be any interest i will download the advertisement of one such company i will not give the name of this ftp site to anyone even if only to protect the company which write the original game disclaimer i do not condone the use or crack of any program i believe it hurt the industry and individual in the long run on the subject of copy protection most pirate give a damn about use software on which the name of the register owner come up on start the program they just have a conscience
 i write a commercial program call game maker can you guess what it do what we do be have a document protect answer question on page x line y which be a real pain we also allow the user to register by send in a card and compute a base on their name the system work in that gotten lot of registration card i hear that the program have be crack though someone two people actually call up my support    one with a question the other want to buy our graphic library right anyway if anyone want to help me catch a cracker and have the crack version mail me i accuse you unless the cracker of course    andy stone stonea suned cs yale edu
 pink noise be a random signal with more low frequency component than white noise if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density be flat which mean that every frequency be present in the noise signal often pink noise be obtain from white noise by integrate of low pass filter a white noise signal therefore pink noise contains much more low frequency component the effect of pink noise be sometimes use to simulate thunder or roar animal an additional low pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why enjoy it

 um     1 your professor if just plain wrong although blue led be one heck of a lot less efficient than red one 2    typical visible light led    really exist led have a fairly narrow region of transmittence since the fermi energy around either side of the band gap fall off exponentially blah blah     you might want to check the copyright date on that blue led most certainly do exist get a bunch at work cree research make them probably along with other company     cree be big in material science though they advertise in the stuff like physic today etc  you can buy them from jameco i think digikey definitely and plenty of other distributor actually these day you _can_ get a    typical visible light    lead    call a    rainbow lead    and forgotten who make it they advertise in edn and many of the other trade rag though it combine a reg green and blue lead all on one chip and have four lead nifty device although probably fairly expensive

 you be quite correct in your understand the filter be not interpolation a that would distort the frequency content of the signal you be listen to generally these player run the sample thru an all pass filter network i have do this for ecg waveform from a person s heart and the effect be rather spooky it actually reconstructs peak that there correctly too and fill in the gap with the properly compute value just a if there have be a real sample take at that point i use a cpu to do all the math it take a decent but not unreasonable amount of cpu time to do this you can keep up with thing in realtime if you write efficient code in case you care the filter method us an fir finite impulse response filter guess that cd maker use the same kind of method anybody out there know the real answer say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor op amp weight to accomplish the filter this strike me a the most cost effective method for volume production run actually i think the only reason they do this be so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic i would guess that it be acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not you can use sloppier component and give the filter a roll off that so sharp too bad that they charge more for something that i think be actually less costly to build i seriously doubt that the filter cost the same but be well they be built to a price spec and that spec say    cheap a possible     dave

 think video brooktree sell a whole line of dacs that can be use normally for graphic application in either 50 or 75 ohm system for example the bt468 can be have in speed up to about 200 mhz bt492 to 360 mhz and 400 mhz with the bt109
 so what  s the story here     all stuck with the regular green red and off yellow orange lead  s what give anybody have a  scoop on fairly low price blue lead  s if your look for led in the  10   20 range forget it blue led just recently become available and the material they be make of be expensive maybe in the future they will become less expensive and brighter but for now go to cost you and the output will be limited if they ever do get a efficient and cost effective a red and green led probably go to see a whole new family of color display
 probably help be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer use those little self contained module i think sharp make them radio shack use to sell them for a few buck maybe they still do the module have 3 lead power ground and demodulate output it contain the photo detector amplifier integrator and demodulator all in a tiny metal can if you want to buy one try radio shack or else a tv repair shop can probably order one btw the carrier frequency be 40 khz and each different tv vcr cable box stereo manufacturer us a unique pulse scheme to perform each different function on their equipment
 judging by your  sig you be try to make some kind of game cartridge information of how to build an eeprom cartidge for the vectrex be available via anonymous ftp at  csus edu since chosen the 27c512 you be probably try to make a  multicart to do this simply 1  load the game image into the eeprom at 2000 4000 etc your eeprom burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the image into one file yourself with suitable gap 2  wire up the cartridge with the low address bit go to the game console and the high bit go to switch to choose between game to directly answer your question above the pin that  kicks up the address  be simply another address line
 i have a mystery part label nec ac100 from the low voltage supply of an nec multisync i monitor a three lead part in a square package like a volate regulator or power transistor the board be label cr691 where the part go possibly an scr the pin label g on the board go to a zener diode reference voltage the pin label t1 go to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power supply and the pin label t2 go to the negative side of the bridge rectifier in the supply if anyone can tell me what this be or well yet where i can buy one just like it please email me at ck3i andrew cmu edu call nec  s    monitor repair number    and not only do they not know what the part be but they think that they can find one to sell to me     it make no sense to me

 in order to get the 15 n response time you need you be well off go to an ecl slicer which can run off a single  5 or  5 2 v supply you just need to bias or do some level shift perhaps to get it in the range check out the ecl 10k book for a simple cheap solution
 not entirely true a friend of mine be have trouble finish the game god and ask me for help since he could not find a    trainer    small patch that let you play without lose life the game be compress but i do find  one  byte which when change in the original  compressed  file would not affect the decompression and would also prevent the    shield    in the game from be tured off turn therefore make you invincible there be many other progs whose copy protection be defeat one way or another and i have see example of this with my own eye the copy protection scheme defeat be various such a use protect mode compress executables progs that load and execute other progs possibly compress dongle key disk etc     i believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection scheme
 one way to make cheap trimmable resistor be to use a high wattage carbon composition resistor and saw a notch in it with a triangular file of course you can only increase the resistance not decrease it
 i think a few thing be be miss overall here     first of all anyone with a do manual can copy a disk or copy anything hidden file dont go far if you be deal with anyone who be not comletely do ignorant off of a hard disk  professional cracker aren t interested in copying disk they be programmer who get some thrill out of go through unassembly listing of program to disable copy protection such a serial number dialog box volume label check and who know what when it come to computer game those people be in the minority however in my experience with the world of people and software it seem that a good majority of people say 80 will at some point copy a friend  s program    gee you really oughta try this    or accept a copy these be people who normally would buy a software package or do without but decide that just once it matter the last thing be people who own or be responsible for more than one computer most people go to spend 150 x of computer for the same software package   they will just install it x of time especially thing like do upgrade
 i strongly disagree i think most pirate be do by amateur who copy the program if    diskcopy    do it if talk a 20 max goal of pirate copy i bet that anything that will beat diskcopy and be easily copy from a hard drive will suffice i hate hard copy manual and would rather have all doc online  not  because i want to copy the program but because it usually faster and and convenient than sift through an old book i find off deeper end  why do everyone think they need to be able to make a backup copy almost all new software must be instal to the hard disk so you be left with the original a your backup i think it a waste of time space and money a well a it make it to tempt to    lend    out the backup no flame intend just my thought
 right it be happ control inc  but you can buy direct from them i have a phone number with me but anyone interested in it can email me for it i remember their button price but the joystick price be 8 95 per dozen at last check should be slightly high for one or two but cheaper than part express a for the trackball i know the new price either but i can sell you rebuilt arcade trackball for 50 that include new roller and new bearing when nec  i also have a pile of use joystick and button that i would be willing to sell please email to address below if interested    donnie
 if you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack them by reading what happens so be told never see this do but i think possible need some hardware knowledge and some software to read the port                                                                                                                      guido klemans internet rcstage1 urc tue nl valid until 16 may 1993                                                                                                                       listen very carefully i will say this only once michelle of the resitance

 for those who would like to know the 6507 be a 6502 without irq or nmi and with only 13 address line give 8k memory space know about it be call the 6526 thats the cia found in the commodore 64 i believe this chip exist when the 2600 be around the tia be mapped into the bottom 128 byte of page 0 and shadow in the bottom 128 byte of page 1  to get an image on the screen you have to wait until the raster line your picture start at load bitmap for this line into the  sprite register tell them what x position to take how many duplicate you want etc then do it all again for the next line this take all of the processor  s time during the visible portion of the display the ram be mapped into the top 128 byte of page 0 and shadow in page 1  the 6502 have a zero page address mode on most instruction that be both shorter and faster than the normal one so it be important on a machine like this to have the scratchpad ram in page 0  unfortunately it also want it stack to be in page 1 the stack pointer be 8 bit and the high byte of the address be hardwired to 1 the iot section be mapped into page 2 somewhere 2 8 bit i o register remember if each bit could be independantly set to i or o like the 6522 and 6526 and 1 8 bit timer with a programmable prescaler i think this be some power of 2 there be no interrupt in the system so many game would set up the timer at some know time go away and do something else for a while then sit and wait for the timer to run down there be no logic in the box to do address decode the riot have at least 2 chip select pin probably one active high one active low and i imagine the tia be much the same various address line be fed directly to chip selects the 6507 like to have rom right at the top of memory so the 2600 have to use rom with active high chip selects not exactly normal so some cartriges have a 7404 in them to convert this to the more usual active low chip select
 not the temperature the karma you see dirt have good karma since all organic and full of living thing but cement be all square off and artificial look and have lose it karma in the process be a karma sink it suck all of the good karma out of the battery which be no longer able to keep a charge because wood be also good and organic put a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problem
 i get mine for about 7 buck at radio shack the instruction do say to expose it to light for a while but mine seem to require very much to make it work i just wish i could get a big sheet of the stuff abouit 12    x 12    for a reasonable price       it cheap from what see
 i have 2 omti 3527 scsi adapter for sale these make an st 506 rll drive look like a scsi disk drive each adapter will support two rll drive i have use this model omti adapter with my amiga a500 and a c ltd scsi host adapter without problem sell these because i get them about the same time i decide to sell instead of expand my amiga so i have never even use them i guarantee they will work with every scsi host adapter they be essentially new in box i paid 150 ea make me an offer

 well actually not quite both radar and radio altimeters measure distance by measure the time require to transmit a signal then receive it reflection from a target radar generally us pulse while radio altimeter use either pulse or a modulate continuous wave transmission in the case of the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be make a an example the original bendix ala 52 radio altimeter be accurate to 1 8 foot at 2500 foot altitude note however that this be a different method of measure than the poster originally ask about the problem with gain accurate measurement between a transmitter and a seperate receiver be that you need a highly accurate time base which start at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter trigger this can not be wire connect since radio wave will actually travel faster in free space air in this case than wire the difference be call the velocity factor of the cable so you need to resort to a common timebase that be automatically correct for distance etc something like a pll connect to a gps receiver should do the trick trigger both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously sound expensive not too bad but plan on spending a few buck in both equipment and effort why not go to a different method surveyor use a laser light system where again the reflection time be measure why not try this sound like something a p e should know about anyway this be actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit there be variance in the antenna and transmission line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit over time you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system with the radio altimeter this be also do but since everything be locate at one place it be much easy to do note especially that the time base for the r a  receiver and transmitter be one unit also     nope fm capture effect say that the strong signal win that be unless the two interfere signal be seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength this be the one problem that make altimeter inaccurate at very low altitude signal bounce off runway tend to be very strong     a high a possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signal radio altimeter typically use frequency around 4 ghz hope this help
 i have recently use the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal i simply ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply     8v in this case a long a your analog input signal stay between the supply rail the 4066 will work fine of course your control logic input must use  8v a the logic low and  8v a the logic high reference so that either 1 all your drive logic must be 4000 cmos with the same bipolar supply or 2 you must provide some kind of voltage level shift circuit between the 4066 and the control logic in my case i be able to use the bipolar supply all the way
 i know much about phone in germany but this be what i know i bought a phone in the u s  for my mother who life in bratislava slovakia and it work just fine the problem be they have wall jack like we do here there be a wire without any jack at the end stick out of the wall so you need to connect the wire not sure if they have wall jack in western europe they may hope this help dagmar kniha carson u washington edu

 hi just a quick question what standard lab solvent can be use to clean electronic equipment and component safely ie not corrode dissolve short out etc the equipment water methanol ccl4 etc i be not an electronics type surprise surprise and i want to avoid use freon
 while i have gotten 8 9 year out of this digital receiver it have be act verry strange of late i hope that the follow symptom may help someone diagnose the error i know that whatever lithium memory backup it have have long die thus if i unplug it it remember the presets it have give up listen to the remote i try change the remote s battery when i try a remote function the receiver register that it receive it a green remote light flash but the right function happen if any function at all also strange  when i hit the    mute    button for example the display panel go black yikes  never see that before     before all the strangeness start the system turn itself off and on again by itself sometimes it play a radio station so i have to kinda twist it yes kinda flex the motherboard chasis for it to get the radio tune back the aux in function always work however     it be inconvenient but not inconvenient enough to pay an expensive repair fee while not a hardware guy i wonder if something a simple a a surge supressor will be a quick fix the strange thing be that these symptom come and go     someone told me this unit series have a bad voltage amp chip
 i would also be interested in the application here i work with a dance and technology program and want to build something to track dancer on a 30 foot wide stage from 50 foot away could make for some interest choreography     light and sound could be control directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number of dancer on stage neat you could even build a spotlight that follow the dancer around on stage can you tell u more about what do sound like a very cool program
     do this imply the german tone dial be compatible with the american one i know at least the british system be not    it be supposedly close enough though that an american phone will work but my modem american have a special set for british standard     michael
 i be interested in find a supplier for an array of led on material which be transparent when nothing be lit not quite sure what lcd screen be like away from the laptop but i would guess they be not too clear an ideal item would be an lead array for which each lead be about 1 2    square yes very course this be for distance view but on a window any pointer of suggestion would be much appreciate  mark battisti mbattist magnus acs ohio state edu
 see if radio shack have a national semiconductor adjustable voltage regulator national part number lm350t or lm350k these device be rat for an input to output differential of up to 35 volt 3 amp digi key corp  have these part a well a several other useful regulator if you have their catalog their phone number be 1 800 344 4539  i can only guess that you may intend to recharge a 7 5 vdc nicad battery with this device and if right you may want to look through some of the hobbiest book to get various idea for battery charge circuit first if you get stuck e mail me your fax number if you have one and i  ll send you some suggestion or schematic

 wonder if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me to sweden and germany dc power and i can buy a special adapter for that in europe the question be if the general electronics work the same i can buy a different wall plug and refit it sure have to but would that do the trick two thing to watch for in germany and i think the same hold for sweden only some of the connection can handle tone dial so make sure the phone can be set to pulse dial most if not virtually all swedish exchange can handle tone dial many old electromechanical exchange have be modify accept tone dial
 i be a bit surprised that the manual for my fluke 87 multimeter suggests apply wd 40 to the test lead socket especially the current range socket the intention be to prevent the test lead is in the wrong scocket beeper from go off when there be no test lead in that socket the manual be a bit vague but i think apply the wd 40 to a swab then wipe the socket instead of spay the stuff directly from the can speak of say meter i compare the 87 against the 8060a that have on my bench for almost 11 year it have be five year since the 8060a have be calibrate on the dc scale they agree within  01 mv ac scale be within about  1 mv the 87 would be just about the perfect portable meter if it have the db scale i feel it be worth the extra 100 for a second 8060 since i use db all that much in my work
 why be circuit board green the material use to make them go by two name if it be use to make circuit board it be call fr 4 the same material be use in the cryogenics industrya and marine industry a a structural material and be call g 10 fr 4 and g 10 be both green they be not green because of a solder mask agent the basic ingredient be a clear epoxy resin and glass fiber i be not sure what the spec be on the resin but if you be really curious you can call nema national electronics manufacturing association or ciba geigy a major manufacturer of epoxy resin to find out a an aside i occasionally mix clear epoxy and glass microsphres to cast small structure for cryogenics experiment the proportion of glass to epoxy be about the same a in g 10 they be the same green color
 i be look for a text reference that will include pinouts description and functionality for just about any ic make do such a text exist be there doc on the internet that reference ic  s it would be a great idea if each major ic manufacturer make available to the public an anonymous ftp site with all data book in the form of text file ala rfc style this would save time and money for the ic manufacturer since a text file cost nothing to send around the world via internet and since most user of ic s be found in the internet anyway be there any book available for purchase that reference a many a possible or be i go to be stuck obtain a zillion databooks from the manufacturer those little phonebook type book that be obsoleted every couple year

 pink noise have constant power per geometric frequency increment octave 1 3 octave etc thus the 10khz 20khz octave have the same amount of noise power a the 10hz 20hz octave white noise have constant power per arithmetic frequency increment hz khz etc thus the 10khz 10 1khz band have the same amount of noise power a the 10hz 110hz band both band be 100hz wide pink noise can be make by passing white noise thru a  3db octave filter usually approximate by a network of several rc pair note you get  3db octave by use half a  6db octave network pink noise be commonly use in audio power response measurement it show up on audio spectrum analyzer with octave related band a a flat line across the band
 lighter fluid be butane absolutely non toxic but be an extreme fire                                   hazard you definately want to go splash this stuff around use a little on an old rag butane    a colourless flammable gaseous alkane        non toxic it have some effect when you inhale allegedly which all be down to asphyxia imho
 we use a cd rom base system here there be about 45 cd rom disk and a 4 disk changer hooked to a dedicate ms dos computer it contains scan image of data book page for several thousand part when you ask it for something it know about mostly active ic part it work quite well they handle all the variety of transistor or diode that exist it be definately a start in the right direction but they need to expand the data base to handle more type of stuff these system cheap we paid about 7 000 for the liscence and get monthly update of some of the cd rom disk we send the old one back to them so that they will keep send u the update i think we pay a yearly maintainence fee of about 1 500 to get the update if you find the part you want you can look at the data sheet on a page sized monitor a special monitor from sigmasystems you can also print each page of the datasheet you want on a laserjet printer page printing take a couple of minute per page it can take a while to dump the 5 or 6 page you usually need i have a feel the maker like it if we make the data available to all internet user  dave
 i hate to disagree but i will note i pirate software nor do i trade it i simply have met and talk extensively with those who have it the fbi can tap someone else  s phone most pirate be do by people who use the program they pirate a crack program tends to get pass on resplendant in the various graphic and animation that advertise whoever perform the modification s i admit that a large portion of the business world be involve in  giving  copy of program to one  s fellow worker maybe take it home for use on one  s own pc but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the business a a whole  how many time have you have someone walk from business to business let people copy disk mostly a matter of convenience a person see a program they want to use and they feel justified in make a copy since    someone  s already paid for it    etc  etc a note this be start to change a bit not much though what about commercially available copy program copyii how about program like teledisk that can do thing diskcopy and before anyone dispute this because they feel that those who would copy know about this after work with people around computer one come to realize that the  average user know much any computer enthusiast be at least 200x well at pre guessing command and how to use them can  you  sit down and use something without reading the manual and it be these people who be do the  20 pirate not joe window user who remember a few argument to the dir command really i find it even out  the online stuff can be read through faster but stuck reading it in linear flow start to finish unless you jump ahead with a search or such a book though you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too but i partially agree i often wish i could grep something that be write down what if they need to re install the idea of a backup still holds  if the original disk go bad out of luck for about 1 2 week which be the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks  if do it without a charge
