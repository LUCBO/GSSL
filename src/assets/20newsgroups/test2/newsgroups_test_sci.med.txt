 be a chronic hbsag carrier do not necessarily mean the patient have chronic persistent anything person who be chronic carrier may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma most case of chronic persistent hepatitis cph be probably the result of a viral infection although in a good number of case the cause can not be determine the diagnosis of cph be make on the basis of liver biopsy it consists of finding of portal inflammation an intact periportal limit plate and on occasion isolated focus of intralobular necrosis but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis cah there be no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis cph have indeed an excellent prognosis if i have to choose between cah and cph there be no question i would also choose cph however a david point out the distinction between the two be not a neat a some of u would have it the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsy show area compatible with both cph and cah maybe it be a sample problem maybe it be a continuum i do n t know darn just when i think i understand something someone who know the pathology have to burst my bubble we  d well not start talk about glomerular disease then i  ll really get depressed seriously though i wonder how someone with cph would end up get a biopsy in the first place my understand and feel free to correct me be that the enzyme be at bad mildly elevate with overall normal hepatic function i would think that the only clue might be a history of prior hepb infection and a positive hepb sag or be it indeed on a continuum with cah and the distinction merely one of pathology and prognosis but otherwise identical clinical feature
 before more bandwidth get waste on this i apologize for my flame first because i distribute the message to so many newsgroups i do not check the crosspostings of the article i follow up on second for not make my argument clear enough i react to the tone of many of the anti kirlian post not to their content right or wrong i found the argument set in arrogant and sneer word that include    joke    which i still think be unwarranted and obviously i should not have do the same

 chronic persistent hepatitis be usually diagnose when someone do a liver biopsy on a patient that have persistently elevate serum transaminase month after a bout of acute viral hepatitis or when someone be found to have persistently elevate transaminase on routine screen test the degree of elevation in the serum transaminase can be trivial or a much a ten time normal other blood chemistry be usually normal a a rule patient with cph have no clinical sign of liver disease chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at least initially and that  s why it  s important to tell them apart by mean of a biopsy the patient with cph only need to be reassure the patient with cah need to be treat

 i try prozac a few month ago and have some insomnia from it but no anxiety or jitter i probably could have live with the insomnia if the prozac have do any good but it only provide a tiny benefit maybe because the person who prescribed it do n t know much and give up after a 20mg dose do n t work now i  m see a psychiatrist who have put me on zoloft another serotonin reuptake inhibitor like prozac one pill day 50mg seem to help some now i  m try 100mg day zoloft have few and milder side effect than prozac i think my doctor say that only 4 of the people take zoloft have to discontinue it because of side effect the only problem i m have be some minor gi distress but nothing too annoy hopefully the zoloft will work maybe your friend should try this one next my psychiatrist  s strategy seem to be to first try one of the serotonin drug usually prozac if that work great if it work but have too many side effect try zoloft or maybe paxil if the serotonin drug do n t work at all try one of the tricyclic like desipramine have a doctor who know something about antidepressant can make a big difference my psychiatrist claim that most gps and fps do n t have much experience in this area and from what i  ve see i  m inclined to believe him i think i know more about antidepressant than the people at my family practitioner  s office disclaimer i  m not a doctor what i know about this come from talk to my psychiatrist and reading sci med

 i think i can explain the    miss part of a leaf    story i have actually see a reproduction of that particular kirlian photograph in a book compile by people who be enthusiast of kirlian photography    that particular photograph        that s right the effect have be observe only once even the writer of the book be inclined to disbelieve in it i conjecture that the maker of that photograph begin by place a whole leaf between two plate and take it kirlian photo for his next experiment he cut the leaf in half put one half down between the same two plate and take another k  p  the    miss half    effect be create by water oil etc left behind after the first photo this explanation must be tentative because after all i be n t there when it happen
 the disease you be talk about be toxoplasmosis it be a protozoan that life and multiplies within cell in cat the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cell and egg be shed in the cat  s feces the protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus the disease may be asymptomatic after the baby be born or it may be very severe toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation have a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem however pregnant woman should not scoop or change the cat  s litterbox in addition whoever do empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his her hand before handle anything else especially food information come from _the merck manual 15th ed _ i hope this information be helpful to you
 do i assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother have a historyy of cancer i be just wondeing since you mention thhat she have an oncologist a bone scan be a nuclear scan thperson receivving the scan be gven a dose of a radioactive tracer and an image device be use to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body the tracer be usually give intravenously iv this mean that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein after a few minute have pass for the tracer to circulate through the body the person be scan with an image device to detect high concentration of the tracer the radiologist or doctor be look for area that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it a far a pain the only pain come from the needle stick that be require to start the iv line what the doctor be probably look for be change in the bone that may have result from cancer this be also why i be wonder if your mother have have cancer since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system i hope i have answer some of your question feel free to e mail me if you have more question related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother  s care i  m a newly graduate nurse and i enjoy share information with other people to help them understand thing that they do not know about before my thought be with you both

 i  ve sent gordon r  my post on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior to post on internet a a professional courtesy somehow i  ve manage to delete my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r  have promise to send it back to me but he  s pretty mad at me right now so i  ll just retype it since dig through all my reference be very time consume take me all day for that pm post i  m not go to cite any reference gordon r  have them i  m go to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan  s new nutrition textbook which be not in my original material to point out that what i  m go to say have some support in the medical community diet have be know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time protein have always have the big role in infection and i  ve already cover the role of protein in protect you against infection now i  m go to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the u s  a far a infection be concerned vitamin a when vitamin a be originally discover it be commonly refer to a the anti infection vitamin many people linus pauling be one have decide to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i  ve already cover big mistake in my opinion vitamin a be also get a reputation a an anti cancer vitamin with good reason the nci currently have numerous clinical trial in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it a well it  s role in both cancer and infection be almost identical but not quite vitamin a come in two completely different form retinol and beta carotene retinol be the animal form and it  s toxic beta carotene be the plant form and it  s completely nontoxic both retinol and beta  carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile be present 60 80 the liver store all of your retinol and dole it out for other tissue to use by synthesize retinol binding protein rbp a normal human adult liver should have 500 000iu to 1 000 000iu of retinol store we be born with 10 000iu in our liver u s  autopsy have show that about 30 of american die with the same or less amount of vitamin a a they be born with if you do n t believe that nutritional reserve like that of retinol in the liver be important then this low vitamin a reserve be not go to affect you but if you believe like i do that the nutrient reserve be important then there be a problem with vitamin a in the u s  the u s  rda for vitamin a in an adult male be 1 000 re or 5 000iu of vitamin a  for adult feamles it 800 re or 4 000iu of vitamin a  diet survey show that most american be get this amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta carotene from their diet but the nrc national research council be go to release a new rda table in 1985 that have the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raise c to 90mg per day and a to 7 500iu per day for adult male that report and it  s recommendation be kill why concern over the increase supplementation be the main reason rdas be set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserve full many scientist in the u s  feel that the time have come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserve be extremely important during period of stress the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist be collect to come out with the 1989 rda list which lower the rda for several nutrient and move the dietary guideline back to where they be when we first start in the 1940  s get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserve we know from autopsy that only about 10 of american have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve 500 000iu to 1 000 000iu i preach nutrient reserve to my student and tell them to measure them in their patient but for vitamin a only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you how much somebody have store we can tell very easily if someone have overfill his or her liver with vitamin a by measure the serium retinol level level above 450ug dl be highly suggestive that you have fill your liver with vitamin a and it  s time to stop take retinol the normal range of serum retinol will be 20 100ug dl hypervitaminosis a be diagnose with a serum retinol level of 2 000ug dl or high interpretation of diagnostic test wallach m d  a little brown series book this level of vitamin a in blood mean that medical attention be necessary due to vitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than do wallach a you will see later in this post between 450ug dl and 2 000ug dl you should have plenty of warn that it  s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain i tell all my student that will use vitamin a in their practice that they have well monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there be clear sign that the liver be full you will never really know if the patient need the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when it  s time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pm study beta carotene can be take to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stop in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver be full of retinol but take beta carotene a the source of retinol take a very long time to fill the liver up i  ve see estimate of 20 30 year if you be in the 30 that only have a much a you be born with in your liver 10 000iu one other problem with beta carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert a much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that do this conversion require zinc in addition the release of retinol from the liver be a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver have plenty of vitamin a  now what do vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the body us vitamin a retinol for many different thing vision the first to be nail down and where you see overt clinical pathology us the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a  reproduction us the retinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection us retinoic acid how do you convert retinol which your white blood cell and the mucosal cell get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzyme one of which require vitamin c this be why pauling have try to pull the title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c do play a role in infection interferon production for example but it  s big role be the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intake of vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid but retinoic acid can not be convert back to retinol a retinal can and once it  s form it  s use and then lose to the body this be why the 1985 nrc group want to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda  s most people take large amount of vitamin c really think that they be help themselves if they do n t have much vitamin a in their liver and they be not also increase their intake of vitamin a they actually do themselves more harm than good retinoic acid function in white blood cell to promote antibody formation in the mucus membrane it be the main factor in promote good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agent from enter the blood system the mucus membrane be refer to a the    first line    defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid have be show to act a a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoter which stimulate cell to divide cancer have two distinct step dna alteration and cell promotion for cell that normally divide all the time promoter be not that important but for lung and breast tissue which do not normally divide promoter be real important in the malignant process this be the major reason why the nci have so many different clinical trial in progress use retinol and or beta carotene chronic infection irritation of the mucus membrane be a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate i tell my student that any patient who walk into their office with a complaint of chronic infection have to be work up for vitamin a along with the other factor that medicine already have on it  s list of cause for chronic infection i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa ou  s branch campus and when i give cme lecture dark adaptation be the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision be impact when liver reverves drop to 50 000iu of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be use but it do not drop until liver reserve drop below 10 000 to 20 000iu ask a patient if they have trouble see at night be a good initial screen if cataract be rule out in one study do on u s  spanish americans where serum retinol level be measure 25 of the sample population have a serum retinol level below 20ug dl a more study be do on serum retinol level in population group of the u s  that have have a history of high infection rate we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rate and low serum retinol level what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here be excerpt from their book vitamin a function in vision in the forrm of retinol it be necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and be require for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin a  retinaldehyde be convert to retinoic acid which have biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status be to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal range for vitamin a content for a child be 20 to 90ug dl low value be indicator of deficiency or deplete body store serum level great than 100ug dl be indicative of toxic level of vitamin a  dark adaptation test and electroretinogram measurement be also useful but difficult to perform on young child rapidly proliferate tissue be sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state the bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat gland be adversely affected a daily intake of more than 7 5mg about 37 000iu of retinol be not advise and chronic use of amount over 20mg 100 000iu can result in a dry and itch skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lip hyperostois bony depositis headache anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend 30mg of retinol via im injection in child for vitamin a deficiency but do not discus treatment for adult their toxic serum retinol level be very conservative i recommend that my student try 25 000iu in adult that be have problem with chronic infection they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by get an rbc zinc run or if their clinical lab ca n t run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a  at 25 000iu per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pull the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol both elaine and jon found doctor who use a much high dose of vitamin a  recall that the pm paper be use 100 000iu to 200 000iu of vitamin a  i do n t suggest that my student use these high dos if you want to fill the liver up fast a part of a clinical trial and be monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that 25 000iu for patient with a demonstrate vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement a long a zinc and vitamin c status be good without have to worry about toxicity if they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol but vitamin a retinol should never be give in high dose to woman who could become pregnant since vitamin a show teratogenicity towards the human fetus the dose need to show this effect on the develop fetus be 18 000iu of retinol per day beta carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus could just take beta carotene instead of retinol supplement help yes but the effect will take a long time to develop my advise be to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it full vitamin a be probably one nutrient that be well off left to prescription by doctor but when we have the m d  s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctor that propose the use of vitamin a supplement for treat patient with chronic sinus and gi distress i think that the most prudent option be to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package insert to educate the general public about the danger of vitamin a supplementation
 i  ve see child do this and wonder about something if the mucus in one  s nose collect filter particle go into the airway if a child then pick and ingests this material might it have a vaccinatory effect since if the body ingests airborne disease or other  stuff on the mucus the body might generate antibody for this small    invasion    maybe this be why some child do n t get sick very often tom
 it be evident you do not read my post carefully i wasn t try to tell you not to eat msg product and produce nor be i argue for or against msg i be simply question the logic of your statement that simply because a one be not allergic to something and b like eat that it follow that one could keep eat whatever it be in my post i have clearly say that i do n t know enough about msg the statement    do n t eat x because it bad    be just _your_ interpretation of nutritional info out there

 hmm this be certainly among the thing i would refer to a quack therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed laetrile whether license or not a a quack there be unethical behavior such a order unneccessary test to increase fee which i would not lable a quackish but prescribe know ineffective therapy seem to me to be one of the hallmark of a quack
 i have ankle reconstruction graft the extensor digitorum longus to the lateral side of the ankle along with a video arthroscopy of the ankle interest to watch to say the least since then i have have periodic muscle spasm not cramp but twitch that be very fast in some of the muscle group along the lateral side and along the top of my foot tx with quinine sulfate produce ring in my ear but do help with the spasm i be on flexeril now but no discernable help with the spasm any idea one thing i be in a short leg cast so heat be not the answer
 the follow be base on copy i be give of some article publish in hearing instrument i would appreciate any comment about this and other  new technology for hearing aid the resound system be developed on the basis of some research at at t and appear to take a different approach from other aid it appear to me that a new  programmable aid like the widex just us a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplify some part of the spectrum more than others and add some compression to try and help out in  noisy situation the major difference in the resound approach be that it divide the spectrum into low and high frequency splitting point be programmable apparently base on the fact that lot of vowel information can be found in the low frequency while the important consonant information unfortunately for me be in the high frequency the two band then be treat with different compression scheme which be programable they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that build on what they call  abnormal growth of loudness this latter be interest and fit my own personal experience though i think the phrase be missleading what appear to be the case be that a you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compare to normal and by the time you reach the  too loud point the sensitivity curve appear to converge this mean that if you just boost all sound level you be overload at the high end for people with hearing loss hence what you want be progressively less amplification a the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point you want to boost low volume sound more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency part of the spectrum specially for someone like me who be relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then fall off a cliff aid with simple compressor do n t descriminate between energy in the low and high frequency and can therefor  compress useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency component particularly impressive be the resound performance with whisper speech and in simulated restaurant noise situation
 any opinion on burzynski  s antineoplastons or information about the current status of his research would be appreciate burzynski  s work be not too promising none of his a 1 through a 5 antineoplastons have be show to have antineoplastic effect against experimental cancer the nci conduct test of a 2 and a 5 against leukemia in mouse with the result that dos high enough to produce toxic effect in the mouse be not effective in inhibit the growth of the tumor or kill it these be in 1983 and 1985 burzynski claim that a 10 be the active factor common to all of a 1 and a 5 something which he have not show a 10 have only be extract from a 2 he also have n t show that a 1 through a 5 be actually distinct substance the nci conduct a series of test use a 10 against a standard panel of tumor that include different cell line from tumor in the follow class leukemia non small cell and small cell lung cancer colon cancer cancer of the central nervous system melanoma ovarian cancer and renal cancer a 10 exhibit neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose level test it be necessary to process a 10 since it be not soluble burzynski s theory require soluble agent but this basically hydrolizes it to pag which he call a 2 5 pag be not an information carry peptide something which byrzynski claim be necessary for antineoplastic activity a 2 1 also derive from a 10 be a 4 1 mixture of pa and pag pa also not a peptide can be purchase at a chemical supply house for about 0 09 a gram a 10 be chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide both of which be habit form and can cause peripheral neuropathy the nasty effect of thalidomide be widely know in spite of this similarity a 10 do not appear to have be test for it  s potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy many of burzynski  s statement about the origin of his theory early research past and present support by others for his work have be show to be untrue sdb
 umm be n t you the one object to someone who be a    license physician    be call a quack or be it just that be a license physician be a good defense against charge of quackery when the physician agrees with your system of belief actually i almost never use the term quack when i discus    systemic yeast syndrome    however i always point out that mainstream medicine view this a a quack diagnosis and i agree with that characterization really i bet virtually everyone reading these post understands what steve dyer gordon bank and i be imply when we have talk about systemic yeast syndrome a a quack diagnosis would you prefer the word    charlatan    i do n t happen to think that all quack be charlatan since i suspect that some believe in the    disease    they be diagnose why be there some reason why you feel that it should n t be point out in sci med that there be no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome

 perhaps the listlessness cause by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression or feel unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed but i know of no specific effect on the brain cause by the thyroid that would cause depression note that weight gain be usually a symptom of both simple blood test would indicate if a thyroid condition be present i do n t know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output but i would tend to doubt it a far a i know clinical depression be cause by a chemical imbalance in the brain and that chemical imbalance have no direct effect on any other part of the body a regular everyday depression imho should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all the pituitary base it secretion of thyroid stimulate hormone tsh on the level of circulate thyroxin there be two type t3 and t4 one be use a a reserve and be change into the other  active  form in the liver the ratio of t3 t4 can be affected by a number of other hormone estrogen for example naturally change activity of the body  s cell would cause change in availabilty of free thyroxin but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance thing out in short order good source for info on the thyroid be the merk manual a physician s reference book although reading it be enough to get one depressed and the encyclopedia brittanica should be available in your local library i hope this have be of some help

 for a very long time i  ve have a problem with feel really awful when i try to get up in the morning my sleep latency at night be also pretty long range from 30 min to an hour i get about 7 hour of bedtime maybe 6 of actual sleep a night and more on the weekend i will spend two or three hour lay in bed after this if i can because i feel so tire when i wake up even more tire than i be when i go to bed which be usually too tire to work anyway i recently have a really bad flu so i call a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant but he get vicks formula 44m which have everything but an expectorant so i use that anyway and the three night i use it i fell asleep rapidly and felt that i get really good quality sleep    that be i actually felt refresh the next morning so i be now try to look into both in the literature and experimentally the use of antihistamine a sleep aid since i be presume that it be the antihistamine that cause the effect the antihistamine in vicks formula 44 be chloriphenamine maleate so i bought some generic tablet of that and try one last night and didn t notice any improvement i might try one with a little alcohol about 1 beer to see if it be a synergism effect also library research seem to show that benadryl be the antihistamine with the strong sedative effect of what be availible otc so i might also buy a generic form of that and try that the pdr seem to suggest that 50 mg be a good dosage level to try for other medical information i have allergy but rarely have an allergic reaction living in new mexico i also have chronically dry eye which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderants i do guess that my problem might be cause by hypoglycemia so i make some change in my diet consistent with that and it do n t help so i go back to a normal diet pretty diverse also take vitamin supplement

 i agree with this consensus that it should not have be write the way it be my doctor who claim to have introduce dr  crook to the possibility of candida overbloom cause diffuse symptom way back in 1961 i have no reason to doubt him on this do not like the book because 1 it make too many unfounded claim and 2 be horribly write from a scientific viewpoint on the other hand my doctor have always kept an open mind on the subject and do believe in aspect of the    yeast connection    but i believe there be some truth to the book hopefully the right clinical study can be do to separate the fact from the fiction in the meantime i  d still encourage people who have    incurable    chronic sinus problem especially if they overuse antibiotic to find a doctor to administer a systemic type anti fungal such a itraconazole along with liver panel before during and after treatment just to play it safe it be an empirical approach for sure but when all else fails and your ent say    sorry you  ll just have to live with it    it be time to step out and try an empirical approach back up with significant anecdotal evidence dr  ivker support by plausible theory outline by marty at this stage you have little to lose particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring the health risk have be show through extensive clinical study both in europe and the u s  to be very minimal with relatively healthy i e  non aids patient i  m glad i do this since i saw remarkable result after only one week on sporanox itraconazole of course your mileage may vary a lot everyone be different so it may not work for you talk to your doctor jon noring    charter member    infj club

 no doubt the sci med  folk be get out their flamethrower i m rather certain that the information you get be not medical literature in the accepted academic scientific journal so the righteous among them will no doubt jump on that also insofar a it do n t conform to the accepted medical presumption that it just do n t matter what you eat and that we can think of the gi tract a a black box in which nothing ever go wrong except for maybe cancer and ulcer the righteous will no doubt jump on that too then there  ll be the one who call your doctor a rave quack even though he like linus pauling be lucid and robust well into his ninety    but nevermind about that he should n t charge for his equipment and supply since they  re no doubt not approve by the fda of course with fda approval an md or pharmaceutical company can charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatment a thalidomide but nevermind about that either unfortunately you dare to step into the sacred turf of net medical discussion without a credential and without understand that the righteous among them will make certain that you be suitably denounce before dismiss you a a fool but maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will send you some reasonable response by e mail 1 2 1 2 oh yes i do have a point a few year ago an md with a thrive practice in a very wealthy part of silicon valley once recommend that i take such treatment to clear up a skin condition not through his office i might add although i  m sure that  s not conclusive it be sure an unusual prescription
 i  ve see people in their forty and fifty become disorient and demented during hospital stay in the example i  ve see drug be definitely involve my own father turn into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital he be fifty three at the time and he be on 21 separate medication the family protest but the doctor be adamant tell u that none of the drug interact they even take the attitude that if he be disorient they should put him on something else a well with the help of an md friend of the family we have all his medication discontinue he have a seizure that night and be put back on one drug two day later he be his old self again i guess there be n t many medical text that address the subject of 21 way interaction i do n t mean this a a cheap shot at the medical profession it be an aspect of hospital that be very frighten to me doc seem to believe that because they have close control of you it  s quite all right to take your bodily equilibrium into their own hand that control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake but health care provider can make mistake too and mistake can be deadly under those circumstance i grant you that sometimes there  s no choice nevertheless i suggest you procure a list of the drug your grandmother be get and discus it with an independent doc her problem may not be the effect of haldol at all haldol may have be use validly or it may have be prescribed because other medication confuse her and because the hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confuse elderly just my opinion

 claude i  ve not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin a retinol could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage usually cause by high sound level but also occassionally due to severe infection the type of cell that vitamin a regulates be the general epithelial cell and these cell type be not the one that function in the ear hearing process the hair cell nerve like epithelial cell in the ear may respond to vitamin a during cellular differentiation embryogenesis but i do n t know if they be still capable of respond in adult if they be capable of respond with new hair growth this would be a very major breakthrough in hearing loss with all of the medical interest in vitamin a it would not be too surprising if a clinical study be do use vitamin a to reverse hearing loss but with only a news announcement to go on and this type of communication be notoriously bad i ca n t comment on your question anymore than i already have if one study have be do more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin a and hearing loss if there really be one

 no they do not work well my doctor start use one recently and i thought the concept be so amaze that i bought one too the thing work by reading the infrared emission from the ear drum the ear drum be hotter than the ear canal wall so you have to point the thing very carefully this mean tug on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal then insert the thing snugly then push a button unfortunately there be many thing that can go wrong it be almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself i get reading which differ from each other by up to 2 degree and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degree i talk to one of the nurse in my doctor  s office recently about this and she say she do n t like them either for same reason she do give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear and what correct insertion feel like but she say she thought it be impossible to do correctly on one  s self she also say that she and other nurse have complain to the company about inaccurate reading and that someone from the company have told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time she demonstrate this prior to reading my temperature and manage to get a reading within 0 5 degree of the oral temperature i take at home before drive to the dr  s office i have also notice tha some nurse click the button then remove the probe immediately this cause wrong reading in my experience you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 second after click the button to get a good measurement the nurse i talk with agree i suspect that many people do n t realize this and therefore get bad reading for yet another reason
 hi stephen ear wax be a healthy way to help prevent ear infection both by prevent a barrier and also with some antibiotic property too much can block the external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and cause some hearing problem it be very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your own or at your physician  s office you can take a syringe no needle and fill it with 50 warm water cold can cause fainting and 50 otc hydrogen peroxide then point the ear towards the ceiling about 45 degree up and insert the tip of the syringe help to have someone else do this and firmly expell the solution depend on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax this could take several rinse if you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier you can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever you may have if wax be old it will be harder and darker you can try add a few drop of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax do this for a couple day then try syringe again it be also safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse it out good luck  heather

 robert i  m  so  glad that you post your biological alchemy discussion i  ve be compare to the famous robert mcelwaine by some reader of sci med i do n t know how to respond since i have not see one of your post just like i have n t read    the yeast connection    let me just start by state that the author of the    cold fusion    paper of recent year be now in scientific exile i believe that one have actually left the country scientific fraud be rare i  m still not sure that if a review of the research note of the    cold fusion scientist    actually prove fraud or just very shoddy experimentation your source do not seem to be research article they be more like lay text design to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combine and life extension text robert i try to keep an open mind but some thing i just ca n t buy one be take sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body your experiment if conduct by reader of this news group would prove that you be right more ash after seed sprout than before unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above 600 degree i believe you will get organic residue in the ash even the residue in commercial incinerator contains organic residue i remember do this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i could n t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i  m really guess at 600 degree f it may actually be much high the point be that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce  only  a mineral ash they also could not measure the mineral so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct chemical reaction abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our soil be these fusion reaction yes many of them do involve fuse oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organic and inorganics do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon be fuse with silicon not in my book robert silicon be the most abundant mineral on our planet i  ve see speculation that man could have evolve to be a silicon base rather than a carbon base life form i like reading science fiction a many people do but i know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most case to separate the fiction from the fact silicon may be one of the trace element that turn out to be essential in human we have several gram of the stuff in our body what  s it do there only the lord know right now but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why a you state it help bone heal and it be not because silicon be transform into calcium almost all of the silicon in the human body be found in the connective tissue collagen and elastin there have be study publish which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis the high the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin be to a an age related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that be often see a part of the age process in human for bone fracture heal the first step be a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate be pumped by osteoblast a high level of silicon in the diet seem to speed up this matrix formation this first step in the bone heal process seem to be the hardest for some people to get go electriacl current have be use in an attempt to get the matrix form cell orient in the right direction so that the matrix can be form in the gap or gap between the end of the broken bone a vitamin c deficiency by slow collagen formation a well a cause the prodcution of defective collagen do slow down both bone and wound heal zinc be also another big player in bone and wound heal and so be silicon in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium for you to take this bone heal observation and use it a proof that silicon be transform into calcium be an interest little trick but robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lay press and yes even some scientific paper be the explanation reasonable without a very good science knowledge base you and most reader of this news group be fly blind you have to take it on faith because you do n t know any well if the explanation seem to make sense to me base on my knowledge base i  m inclined to consider it this usually mean try to find other source that come to the same conclusion if the idea like a candida bloom seem to make sense to me i tend to pursue it a long a any advice that i  m go to give be n t go to really mess somebody up if this make u kindred soul robert then i guess i  ll have to live with that label for the physician who have decide to read my response to robert  s interest post i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on u s  tv i ca n t remember the network or his name like many night i be on my computer and my wife be watch tv in our den where i have my computer setup this neurosurgeon take kid with brain tumor that everyone else have give up on and he us    unconventional    treatment his own word

infect with hiv the finding do not indicate that azt should not be administer in people with full blown aid writes columnist john maddox azt have be use in the united state in asymptomatic hiv positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appear to abate the decline of t cell count however a report in the lancet demonstrate that azt should not be use early in the course of disease while the cd4 count of the 877 people give azt be consistently great than those of patient receive only placebo the first three year of follow up have show that the proportion of people in the two group progress to overt aid or even to death be not significantly different at roughly 18 percent the conclusion be that azt be not an effective aid drug in hiv infected individual and that cd4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aid in infect people but nothing be imply by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptom have already appear    there be no case for abandon that treatment at least on the evidence now available it be much more alarm that the cd4 count have proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aid researcher should acknowledge hiv be alive from the begin of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a well understand of the pathogenesis of aid concludes maddox                                                                       infective and anti infective property of

 chronic persistent hepatitis be usually diagnose when someone do a liver biopsy on a patient that have persistently elevate serum transaminase month after a bout of acute viral hepatitis or when someone be found to have persistently elevate transaminase on routine screen test the degree of elevation in the serum transaminase can be trivial or a much a ten time normal other blood chemistry be usually normal a a rule patient with cph have no clinical sign of liver disease chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at least initially and that  s why it  s important to tell them apart by mean of a biopsy the patient with cph only need to be reassure the patient with cah need to be treat i just go back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis it seem that indeed most case of cph be persistant viral hepatitis whereas there be a multitude of potential and probable cause for cah viral drug alcohol autoimmune etc  physician seem to have a variety of    threshold    for elect to biopsy someone  s liver personally i think that if the patient be asymptomatic with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and pt one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risk of a biopsy others may well biopsy such a patient thus provide these sample for study it would be interest to see if anyone  s do any decision analysis on this

 i do n t know the first thing about yeast infection but i be a scientist no scientist would take your statement       no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome       to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question noring have point out the catch 22 that if the    crazy    theory be true you probably couldn t find any direct evidence of it    that you could n t observe those yeastie beasties with present method even if they be there noring and the fellow from oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggest one set of anecdotal evidence in favor base on their personal experience    namely that when people with certain condition be give anti fungals many of them appear to get well so if you have any evidence  against  the hypothesis    for example control double blind study show that the anti fungals do n t do any well than sugar water    then let  s hear it if you do n t then what we have be anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject disbelief on the other in which case please there be no point in yell back and forth at each other any longer since neither side have any convincing evidence either positive or negative and i understand that your abject disbelief be base on the existence of people who may get famous or make money apply the diagnosis to everything in sight make wild claim with no evidence and always refuse to do control study but that have absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experience of the people on the net observe anti fungals work on themselves and other people in certain specific case there be also quack who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that it s completely broken down in the gut but this do n t change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fight oxidative damage same thing just cause there be candida quack that do n t establish evidence against the candida hypothesis if there  s some other reason besides the quack if only anecdotal to think it could be true then that be what have to be consider that be what the net people have be talk about but again there be no point in argue about it there be anecdotal evidence and there be no convincing evidence and there be also some candida quack out there i hope everyone can agree on all of that thus it appear to me the main question now be whether the proponent can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and document enough manner to make a good case for carry out a good control double blind study of antifungal or else forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test just carry it out themselves    and also whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptom on which such a study should be carry out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis ken

 here be a press release from huntington medical research institute new method for diagnose alzheimer  s disease discover at huntington medical research institute result to be report to national desk health writer contact john lockhart or belinda gerber 310 444 7000 or 800 522 8877 for the huntington medical research institute los angeles april 28    a new method for diagnose and measure chemical imbalance in the brain which lead to alzheimer  s disease and other dementia have be discover by researcher at the huntington medical research institute hmri in pasadena calif  result of their research will be report in the may issue of the scientific journal radiology use an advanced form of magnetic resonance image mri call magnetic resonance spectroscopy mr a research team lead by brian d  ross m d  d phil  conduct a study on 21 elderly patient who be believe to be suffer from some form of dementia the exam use standard mri equipment fit with special software developed at hmri call clinical proton mrs  clinical proton mr be easily apply give doctor confirmatory diagnosis in less than 30 minute an automate version of clinical proton mr call proton brain examination probe reduces the examination time yet far provide confirmatory diagnosis in less than 10 minute by comparison the current    standard of care    in test for alzheimer  s disease call for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological test which can be very upset to the patient be not definitive and can only be confirm by autopsy in addition to alzheimer  s disease the new clinical proton mr exam may have application in diagnose other dementia include aids related dementia parkinson  s disease and huntington s disease    we  ve developed a simple test which can be administer quickly and relatively inexpensively use exist mri equipment fit with either the mr or probe software    say dr  ross add    this will help physician to diagnose alzheimer  s earlier and intervene with therapeutic before the progression of the disease cause far damage to the delicate inner working of the brain    dr  ross and his hmri team measure a family of chemical in the brain know a inositol and myo inositol mi act a a marker in the study in comparison to healthy patient those diagnose with alzheimer  s show a 22 percent increase in mi while their level of another chemical call n acetylaspartate naa be significantly low indicate a loss of brain stimulating neuron believe to be associate with the progression of the disease current drug therapy for alzheimer  s disease be widely consider to be inadequate this be attributable dr  ross believe to the theory that alzheimer  s be cause by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cell this belief have be adhere to over the last 15 year and consequently most drug to treat alzheimer  s be base on the change receptor for acetylcholine    physician have a real need for a test to differentiate alzheimer  s from other dementia to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocol for the treatment of this disease for this reason we consider this test a major advancement in medicine    say bruce miller m d  a note neurologist at harbor ucla mr researcher and a co author of the study other member of the hmri research team include rex a  moat ph d  truda shonk b s  thomas ernst ph d  and suzanne woolley r n the probe software can be fit on the approximately 1 200 general electric mri unit currently in use in the united state and will be configure for other manufacturer mri unit soon for interview with dr  ross advance copy of the radiology may issue and other information please contact john lockhart or belinda gerber for hmri at 310

by the german neuropathologist alois alzheimer a the disease progress it lead to loss of memory and mental function follow by change in personality loss of control of bodily function and eventually death how many people do it affect alzheimer  s disease affect an estimate 4 million adult in the united state and be the fourth lead cause of death take approximately 100 000 life each year while alzheimer s debilitates it victim it be equally devastate both emotionally and financially for patient family ad be the most common cause of dementia in adult symptom worsen every year and death usually occurs within 10 year of initial onset what be it sign and symptom although the cause of ad be not know two risk factor have be identify advanced age and genetic predisposition the risk of develop ad be less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old but increase steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90  in patient with familial ad immediate family relative have a 50 percent chance of develop ad one of it first symptom be severe    forgetfulness    cause by short term memory loss dr  herman weinreb of the school of medicine at new york university say    whether forgetfulness be a serious symptom or not be largely a matter of degree    and suggests the follow criterion    forget the name of someone you see infrequently be normal    forget the name of a love one be serious    forget where you left your key be normal    forget how to get home be serious doctor suggest that people with severe symptom should be evaluate in order to

 my opinion for what it  s worth be that 40 x ray be  way  too many guidleines have be set on the number of dental x ray and chest x ray that one should have over a give period of time because of all the environmental factor that can cause cancer in human ionize radiation be one of the most potent split dna and cause hydroxyl free radical formation in tissue cell ultasound like that use in see the fetus in the uterus have be show to be extremely good at pick up tumor in the prostate and gallstone in the gallbladder but kidney tissue may be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stone any radiologist care to comment most stone will pas but it  s a very painful process unlike gallstone i do n t think that there be many drug that can help    dissolve    the kidney stone which be probably calcium oxalate vitamin c and magnesium have work in rabbit to remove calcium from calcify plaque in the aterial wall i have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could speed up the process of kidney stone passage but i  m pretty confident that a diet change and or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance if surgery be be contemplate the stone must be in the kidney tubule a second opinion be a good idea because there be well less damage way to break up the stone if it  s log within the kidney sonic blast hmo  s be notorious for conservative care and long wait for expensvie treatment my condolence to your friend

 i  ve see people in their forty and fifty become disorient and demented during hospital stay in the example i  ve see drug be definitely involve my own father turn into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital he be fifty three at the time and he be on 21 separate medication the family protest but the doctor be adamant tell u that none of the drug interact they even take the attitude that if he be disorient they should put him on something else a well with the help of an md friend of the family we have all his medication discontinue he have a seizure that night and be put back on one drug two day later he be his old self again i guess there be n t many medical text that address the subject of 21 way interaction i saw the same thing happen to my father and i can more or less validate your take on hospital it seem to me that medical science understands precious little about take care of the human machine drug be give a a response to symptom and i guess that make sense since all the study that validate the effectiveness of those drug be base on a narrow assessment of the degree of particular symptom but there seem to be very little appreciation for the well being of a person outside of the number that appear on a test i watch my dad wither away and lose huge amount of body fat and muscle tissue while in the hospital there be something a little crazy about a system in which there be more attention paid to give you every late drug available than there be attention paid to whether you have have enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue it be really really bizarre

 a friend be recently admit to north carolina memorial hospital because of suspect meningitis serious business they want to do a lumbar puncture for which a ct scan be a prerequisite i arrive in her hospital room about an hour after she have return from the ct  she be in tear evidently the technician in the ct lab have be very unpleasant to her to begin with they put her on the apparatus that move you into the machine itself and just push a button to slide her straight into the machine without any explanation imagine this you worried you may have a deadly disease and next thing you know you  re be put into this big scary machine without a word of explanation about what be go to happen to you i believe this be inexcusable she wave her hand a if to say what be you do to me and they respond with annoyance and anger next they insert or try to insert an iv catheter apparently she have a lot of trouble with these and complain of the pain the technician just stop and fix her with a glare without any word of explanation be there anything i can do about these pig i realize that these technician do this sort of job day in and day out and that some patient can be very irritate and uncooperative but this be simply no excuse their purpose for exist be to help sick people and there be no excuse for this sort of behavior fortunately my friend be fine but i imagine a large proportion of the people who get ct scan be not fine at all they have cancer and that sort of thing they do n t need this kind of shit also since i name the hospital involve i should also point out that neither she nor i have any complaint about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at ncmh

health high fat high calorie diet rapidly increase risk factor for coronary heart disease in native population of develop country that have traditionally consume diet low in fat these finding accord to investigator at the oregon health science university in portland have serious implication for public health in both industrialize and develop country    this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have high blood cholesterol and triglyceride level it show also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby lead to a whole host of other health problem in develop country and affluent nation a well    explains principal investigator dr  william e  connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health science university over the past 25 year dr  connor and his team have characterize the food and nutrient intake of the tara humara indian in mexico while simultaneously document various aspect of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexican number approximately 50 000 and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountain in the state of chihuahua the tarahumara have couple an agrarian diet to endurance race probably a a result coronary heart disease which be so prevalent in western industrialize nation be virtually non existent in their culture loosely translate the name tarahumara mean    fleet of foot    reflect a tribal passion for bet on    kickball    race in which participant run distance of 100 mile or more while kick a machete carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto bean tortilla and pinole a drink make of ground roast corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruit and vegetable the tara humaras also eat small amount of game fish and egg their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calorie a fat of which the majority 69 percent be of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet a simple and very rich in nutrient while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumara have average plasma cholesterol level of 121 mg  dl low density lipoprotein ldl  cholesterol level of 72 mg dl and high density lipoprotein hdl  cholesterol level of 32 to 42 mg dl all of those value be in the good low risk range accord to the researcher elevate cholesterol and ldl cholesterol level be consider risk factor for heart hicnet medical newsletter page 20 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 disease hdl cholesterol be consider beneficial in previous study the tarahumara have be found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high cholesterol diet with elevation in total and ldl  cholesterol clinical research center

sample be frozen and ship to dr  connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analysis regular measurement include participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumara five woman and eight men include one adolescent be fed their native diet for 1 week follow by 5 week of an    affluent    diet    in this study we go up to a concentration of dietary fat that be 40 percent of total calorie this be the prototype of the holiday diet that many american consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber    elaborates dr  conners such dietary characteristic be reflect in the cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devise research dietitian sonja conner work with dr  connor    the csi be a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturate fat in the diet csi indicates the diet  s potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl    dr  connor explains the tarahumaran diet average a very low csi of 20 dr  connor  s    affluent    diet use in the study rank a csi of 149  the experimental design of this study reflect the importance of establish baseline plasma lipid level typical of the native diet before expose subject to the experimental diet the standard curve relate dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amount of fat change in dietary fat and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma level    you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variable you be go to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example do not discriminate on the basis of diet between individual who get heart disease because the diet be already high in fat all subject be already eat on a plateau    dr  connor say after 5 week of consume the    affluent    diet the subject mean plasma cholesterol level have in crease by 31 percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rise 39 percent hdl cholesterol increase by 31 per cent and ldl to hdl ratio change therefore very little plasma triglyceride level increase by 18 percent and subject average an 8 pound gain in weight accord to dr  connor lipid change occur surprisingly soon yield nearly the same result after 7 day of affluent diet a after 35 day hicnet medical newsletter page 21 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 the increase in hdl carry broad dietary implication for industrialize nation    we think hdl cholesterol increase because we increase the amount of dietary fat over the fat content use in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl level after raise the dietary cholesterol but keep the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increase fat intake to 40 percent of the total calorie we reach the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflect the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increase quite a bit in this study    dr  connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans be not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amount of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to american because of their usual high fat intake dr  connor recommends a diet for american that contains less than 20 percent of total calorie a fat less than 100 mg of cholesterol and a csi around 20 vary in accordance with caloric need such a diet be low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr  connor also comment on recent suggestion that american adopt a    mediterranean style    diet    the original mediterranean diet in it pristine state consist of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy product we be already eat a lot of meat and dairy product simply to continue that pattern while switch to olive oil be not go to help the situation    the world health organization who be focus much attention on the emergence of disease such a coronary heart disease in nation and society undergo technological development dr  connor say that coronary heart disease start with a give society  s elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen    if the pattern of afluence increase the entire population will have have a high

 for one week she probably want to see how you react to the diet if it change anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calorie where before you have a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked small meal but more of them not terrific amount of meat it s hard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal    last    longer eat pasta or rice which give their calorie up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe small meal a you may be get less room in the stomach area be the baby still come up be it start to push or rub under your rib how tight be your clothes you should n t be wear any clothing that compress your middle be sure not to    suck in    your stomach when sit again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try lay on your side back and stay in recline position for the many hour you be be inactive easy on your leg circulation a well you might try let the baby    turn    or at least not be force under the rib during the last month when you be shortwaisted it  s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscle if i have my second one to do over again i think i  d have try to loosen up since he do n t turn sideways until late and the relief be enormous maybe this doctor do have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nag all her patient this way especially if she  s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be come up be something to be avoid if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy be miserable during the second i have very little trouble some article have say that woman with nausea have a statistically well chance of carry their baby grain of salt here good luck
 agent of the original poster do not say why his mother have be in hospital but i can answer a few general point elderly patient may exhibit a marked difficulty in cop after be in hospital for a few day the drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have be cop at home even young people find the change unsettle though we have thought that this decrement in function after say anaesthesia and surgery for a fracture hip a common event in the elderly be due to anaesthesia there be good evidence that the change of situation be much more important some hospital have try a  rapid transit system for hip fracture aim to have the patient back at home within 24 hour of admission the selection of the anaesthetic have no effect on the ability to discharge these patient early anaesthetist who work with the elderly which be almost all of u generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drug use to the individual patient even so there be some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return this be the sort of thing which be detect by set quite difficult task not the gross change that the original poster note haloperidol haldol tm be a long act drug the plasma half life of the drug be up to 35 hour if the decanoate a sort of slow release formulation be use it may be week the elderly be sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reason without know more it be hard to comment

 i  ll tell you all that i know about chromium but before i do i want to get a few thing off my chest i just get blast in e mail for my kidney stone post kidney stone be primarily cause by diet a be heart disease and cancer when i give dietary advise it be not intend to encourage people reading this news group or sci med nutrition where i do most of my post to avoid see a doctor nothing can be far from the truth kidney stone can be cause by tumor and this possibility have to be rule out but once it be diet be a good way of prevent a reoccurance same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these disease do n t use what i  m go to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid go to a doctor you have to go hopefully you will find a doctor who know enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factor for both disease a part of a treatment program but the odds be that you will not and that  s why i  m here when my wife detect a lump in here breast i do n t say do n t worry my vitamin e will take care of it any breast lump have to be work up by a physician plan and simple if it  s begnin which most be fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent far breast lump from occur but let me tell you right now if you have try diet and supplementation and another lump return get your butt into the doctor  s office a fast a your little foot can carry you well yet have a mammography do on a regular basis my wife kept put her  s off both myself and her gynocologist told her she need to have one do her gynocologist even schedule one but she do n t show up too busy run the operating room for the big hospital in tulsa one more thing i be not an orthomolecular nutritionist this group us high dose vitamin and mineral to treat all kind of disease there be absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamin and mineral can and do have drug action in the body but you talk about fly blind man this be really blind treatment no drug could ever be use a these vitamin and mineral be be use i  m not say that some of this stuff could n t be right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition be a lot like that of weinsier and morgan the two m d  s who write the new clinical nutrition textbook my push be the nutrient reserve and the lab test need to measure these reserve and then supplementation or diet change to get these reserve built up to where they should be to let you handle stress that  s where i  m come from folk blast away if you want i  m not go to change put me in your killfile if you want i really do n t care i  m average 8 10 e mail message a day from people who think that i  ve get something important to say but i  m also get hit by a few with an axe to grind that  s life chromium be one of the trace element it have a very limited but very important role in the body it be use to form glucose tolerance factor gtf gtf be make up of chromium nicinamide niacin glycine cysteine and glutamic only the chromium and the niacin be need from the diet to form gtf some food already have gtf liver brewer or nutritional yeast and black pepper when chromium be in gtf a pretty good absorption be see about 20 but when it be simply present a a mineral or mineral chelate chromium picolinate it  s absorption be much low 1 to 2 low for all the mineral i  ve be post in misc fitness and chromium have come up there several time a a    fat burner    chromium be among the least toxic of the mineral so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm i would n t do it though the adequate and safe range for chromium be 50 to 200ug per day the average american be get about 30ug per day from his her diet chromium level decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes be primarily a chromium deficiency i can cite you several study that have be do with glucose tolerance in type ii diabetes but i  m not go to because for each positive one there also seem to be a negative one a well i  m convince that the problem be bioavailability when yeast gtf be use good result be obtain but when chromium itself be use the result be usually negative in addition to type ii diabetes chromiuum have be examine in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mixed result a far a cardiovascular disease be concerned since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium be n t too surprising glucoma be a little more interest muscle eye focus activity be primarily an insulin responsive glucose driven metabolic function if this eye focus activity be impaired by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular pressure be believe to be elevate in a fairly large study of 400 pt with glaucoma the one consistent find be a low rbc chromium j  be coll nutr 10 5  536 1991 but this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start pop chromium supplement for one thing just about every old person be go to have a low rbc chromium unless they have be take chromium suppleemnts yeast since glucoma be often found in old people it  s not too surprising that chromium be low in the rbc  s if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma you could find out what your body chromium pool size be by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysis most clinical lab be not go to run a rbc chromium there be plenty of lab that will do a hair and nail analysis for you but i would n t use them there be just too much funny business go on in these unregulated lab right now here  s weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not consider chromium to be one of those mineral for which a reliable clinical test be available they do n t like the hair and nail analysis lab either and they also recognize the rbc chromium be primarily a research test that be not routinely available in most clinical chemistry lab this have to change and a more lab run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggest make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency base on a document clinical response to chromium run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation once you make the diagnosis put the patient on 200ug of crcl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day what  s my advise do n t take chromium supplement to try to loose weight they just do not work that way if you want to take them and then exercise that would be great do include yeast a part of your diet most american be not get enough chromium from their diet if you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status when he or she say    what in the world be you talk about    just say please get a copy of weinsier and morgan  s new clinical nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patient who present with a poor glucose tolerance if you ca n t do that i  ll find a doctor who can thank you very much

 this be to followup my previous reply on this topic which it have be point out to me might have be dangerously mislead in two spot 1  i state that psychotherapy meaning talk therapy and so on be use to treat obsessive compulsive disorder which though sometimes true be mislead it be not often found effective particularly by itself primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy the most current theory of this condition attribute it to more to biological cause than psychological in place where this distinction becomes important 2  i mention that the dsm iiir mention  impulses a a possible diagnostic marker however this might look like something people associate with psychotic condition uncontrollable or unpredictable behavior which be not the case with ocd one of the diagnostic criterion of ocd be that the individual can and do suppress some of their  impulses although they be an unending source of anxiety the obsessive thought and ritualistic action usually associate with ocd be most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part some reference one non technical and several technical that someone be kind enough to supply for me but be unable to post themself technical ref and thanks very much to those who supply constructive criticism to my first post on ocd i hope this help clarify the part that be mislead kind regard
 yogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus and l  bulgaricus l  acidophilus be the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and be primarily responsible for keep the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free most of the commercial yogurt sell in the u s  have a very low l  acidophilus and l  bulgaricus count neither of these bacteria be obligate anaerobe with be much more important in deal with the diarrhea problem gordon r  have told me through e mail that he give his patient l  acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobe which set up shop in the colon but he have n t told me which one yet the lactobacillus genus be mostly facultative anaerobe and will set up shop where they have access to oxygen if give a chance mouth anus sinus cavity and vagina have these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida bloom in the anal region or the vagina i have not propose a systemic action for candida bloom i know that others swear that all kind of symptom arise from the evil yeast bloom in the body i  m not ready to buy that yet i do believe that complication at specific site vagina anal and maybe low colon sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which remove the compete bacteria from these site and thus let candida grow unchecked restore the right bacterial balance be the best way in my opinion to get rid of the problem anti fungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin a supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and low the ph to basically starve the candida out

 i do n t like the term    quack    be apply to a license physician david questionable conduct be more appropriately call unethical in my opinion i  ll give you some example 1  prescribe control substance to patient with no demonstrate need other than a drug addition for the medication 2  prescribe thyroid prep for patient with normal thyroid function for the purpose of quick weight loss 3  use laetril to treat cancer patient when such treatment have be show to be ineffective and dangerous cyanide release by the nci these be error of commission that competently train physician should not committ but sometimes do there be also error of omission some of which result in malpractice suit i do n t think that use anti fungal agent to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be have a problem with candida or another fungal growth be an error of commission or omission healer have have a long history of try to relieve human suffer some have stuck to standard approve procedure others have be willing to try any reasonable treatment if there be a chance that it will help the patient the key have to be tie to the healer  s oath    i will do no harm    but you know david that very few treatment involve no risk to the patient the job of the physician be a very difficult one when risk versus benefit have to be weigh each physician deal with this risk benefit paradox a little differently some be very conservative while others be more agressive an agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but a long a the motive be improve the patient  s health and not an attempt to rake in lot of money through some of the scheme that have be uncovered in the medicare fraud case i do n t see the need to label these healer a quack or even unethical what do i reserve the term quack for pseudo medical professional these people lurk on the fringe of the health care system wait for the frustrate patient to fall into their lair some of these individual be really do a pretty good job of provide    alternative    medicine but many lack any formal training and be in the    business    simply to make a few fast buck while a patient can be reasonably assure of get competent care when a liscenced physician be consult this alternative care area be really a buyer  s beware arena if you be lucky you may find someone who can help you if you be unlucky you can loose a lot of money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo  medical professional to diagnose disease which be the fortay of the liscened physician i hope that this clear thing up david
 these be my last word on the subject some people think it enhances the flavor i personally do n t think it help the taste it make me sick so i try to avoid it well i know that msg effect me adversely maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff excuse me why ca n t people learn to cook from scratch  on  the net i  ve gotten lot of recipe off the net that do n t use additive if you like additive then get off the net and go to your local supermarket buy lot of package food and you get off the net i do n t hey i  ll pay  my  hard earn dollar to buy food that cost more but do not have preservative i choose to speak with my pocketbook in many way nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fry food like fish and chicken etc ad naseum or the    and other natural flavoring syndrome    it  s be a few year since i  ve bought anything label with    and other natural flavoring    well i have have similar reaction many time that be when i really start watch carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what  s in there reaction to lawry  s season salt guess what  s in there i  ll give you a hint i  ve have enough problem with many many many different product with msg that i figure out one thing unless i plan on get sick i wo n t eat the stuff without my seldane and do i ever learn to read label which be why i start check every time i get sick and every time i get sick msg be somehow involve in one of the food product and consider there be no other similar ingredient to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most importantly it  s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incredibly frugal fiance do n t flinch when i literally threw out or give away all the food product in his pantry that have msg and he always flinch when there  s waste but it be a simple explanation i wo n t eat this stuff i wo n t cook with this stuff so i can either throw it out or give it away probably lawry  s season salt i love the way that taste i  m not say i never consume anything with msg i  ve notice that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chip once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chip will bother me if i also have chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurant the day before but some say that only 2 of the population have a problem with msg some say it  s more like 20 but let  s say that it  s 5 how many people would have to be test that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i would n t volunteer for a test like thanks guy but i do n t want to get sick also i  m sure that most people probably have vary degree of sensitivity at different time if i have a cold i  m much more susceptible to the reaction than when i  m healthy a proven today when i  m stuffy but for some silly reason i still give in and decide to have the bbq chip cathy do n t i have n t save all my posting but i never call it    chinese restaurant syndrome    and i never state i get it only from chinese food i just thought it would be easy to conduct my personal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold or not hold the msg i ca n t call up whoever make doritos and ask them to make me one back of chip without msg well i believe i mention that in an earlier post let  s see you write this message at date 20 apr 1993 00 09 31  0500 but on date 19 apr 1993 16 33 18 gmt oh and just in case anyone think i  m prejudice against either chinese food or asian people i  m not go home to cook some chinese food for the guy i  m marry next week incidentally his last name be wu so stop it with the flame mail    why do a woman work ten year to change a man  s habit and then complain that he  s not the man she married    barbra streisand

 some of the md  s in this newsgroup have be rid my butt pretty good maybe in some case with good reason in this post on depression i  m lay it all out i  ll continue to post here because i think that i have some knowledge that could be useful once you have read this post you should know where i  m come from when i post again in the future lida i can emphasize with your situation both my wife and i suffer from bout of depression her  s be brought on by breast cancer and mine be a rebound stress reaction to her modify radical mastectomy and chemotherapy lida i use my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six month of chemotherapy with the approval of her oncologist when severe depression set in a few month after the chemo stop i try to use supplement to bring her out of it i have    cure    her pm use supplement and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression a well it do n t work and she be put on prozac by her oncologist two winter ago three year after by wife  s breast cancer i get hit with severe depression pretty typical and one reason why many marriage break up after breast cancer or another stressor i try to take care of it for several month with supplementation do n t work my internist end up put me on prozac i be go to give you a list of several study that have be do use b6 niacin folate and b12 to    cure    depression i  m not go to do that because all you would be do be fly blind like i be lida i do believe that depression can have a dietary component but the problem be that you need to know exactly what the problem be and then use an approach which will    fix    the problem for chemotherapy i knew exactly what drug be go to be use and exactly what nutrient would be affected same thing for pm i be fly blind for both of these stressor but the literature that i use to devise a treatment program be pretty good depression be just too complicate what you really need be a nutritional scan this be not a diet analysis but an analysis of your body nutrient reserve for every vitamin and mineral except vitamin c you have a reserve the rda be not design to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserve full it be only design to keep them from be empty which would cause clinical pathology stress will increase your need for many vitamin and mineral this be when your reserve become very important lida without your permission i  m go to use your post a a conduit to try to explain to the reader in this group and sci med where i  m come from i have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic medical school for ten year now i  ve write my own textbook because none be available what i teach be not a rehash of biochemistry i preach nutrient reserve yes my lecture in this course be refer to by my student a sermon here be what i cover indroduction and carbohydrate lipid protein i protein ii energy balance evaluation of nutritional status i a clinical perspective evaluation of nutritional status ii evaluation of nutritional a biochemical perspective status iii homework assignment use the nutritionist iv diet and fitness analysis software program weight control food fad and fact age related change in nutrient requirement food additive contaminant and cancer drug nutrient interaction mineral and water balance sodium potassium and chloride calcium magnesium and phosphorus iron zinc and copper iodine and fluoride other trace mineral vitamin a vitamin e vitamin d and k vitamin c thiamin and niacin riboflavin and pyridoxine pantothenic and folic acid biotin and b12 other nutrient factor enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition every three year i spend my entire summer review the medical literature to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook i last do this in the summer of 1991  i read everything that i can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handout which be bound in three separate book that have 217 237 and 122 page opposite each page of write text which i write myself i  ve pull figure table and graph from various copyright source since this material be only be use for educational purpose i can get around the copyright law so far i can not send this material out to newsgroup reader a i  ve be ask to do i be now in the process of try to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab this be the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete this lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamin and mineral that be know to be require in human the mayo clinic already us a similiar lab to design supplement program for their cancer patient cancer treatment center of america which be a private for profit organization with hospital in illinois and oklahoma tulsa also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab i also believe that the pritikin clinic in california have a similiar lab setup for physician reading this post i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that have just be publish feb by mosby i have be use alpers manual of nutritional therapeutic a little brown series book a a supplemental text for my course but alpers be gear more to residency training two m d  s have write this new clinical nutrition textbook and it be gear more towards medical student education and it do a good job of cover the lab test that can be run to ass a patient  s nutritional status let me quote a few sentence from the preface of this new text    so called nutrition specialist be in reality gastroenterologist hematologist or pediatrician who just happen to profess some knowledge of nutrition a it related to their field of practice       unfortunately about two third of the medical school in the united state require no formal instruction in nutrition       but time and medical practice have change more than half of the lead cause of death in this country be nutrition related           this monograph should accomplish the follow two objective 1 it should complement your medical training by emphasize the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice and 2 it should heighten your awareness of nutrition a a medical speciality that be vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of disease of essentially every organ system    roland l  weinsier md drph lida my advise to you be that you tell your family member to try to find a physician who have an understand of the role that vitamin and mineral yes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run menopause be often a time when woman suffer depression there be a lot of hormonal change that be occur but they be not the same one that occur during pm a nutritionist may also be able to help not too long ago a poster mention that his nutritionist have diagnose a selenium deficiency base on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test the specific test for the selenium reserve most clinical lab will not run this test and i advise him to try to make sure that the lab that do the test be certify there be also a lot of hair and nail analysis lab setup to do trace mineral analysis but these lab be not regulate check of these lab use certify standard and also those do water lead analysis show some pretty shoddy test be go on if you or anyone else find someone who will run these speciality nutrition test make sure that they be use a lab that have be certify under clia the clinical laboratory improvement act a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserve have be show to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake a monitor by food log and software analysis nutritionist iv and other software program but there be still about half of the nutrient require by human that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status until we have more nutritional assessment clinical lab in operation in the u s  and physician who have be train how to use the nutritional profile that these lab provide to devise a treatment approach that us diet change and supplementation

 be a chronic hbsag carrier do not necessarily mean the patient have chronic persistent anything person who be chronic carrier may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma most case of chronic persistent hepatitis cph be probably the result of a viral infection although in a good number of case the cause can not be determine the diagnosis of cph be make on the basis of liver biopsy it consists of finding of portal inflammation an intact periportal limit plate and on occasion isolated focus of intralobular necrosis but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis cah there be no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis cph have indeed an excellent prognosis if i have to choose between cah and cph there be no question i would also choose cph however a david point out the distinction between the two be not a neat a some of u would have it the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsy show area compatible with both cph and cah maybe it be a sample problem maybe it be a continuum i do n t know

 i have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss a recent rough test show a gently slop loss to 10 20db down at 1000cps then it fall off a cliff to 70 80dbs down from 1500cps on this type of loss be difficult to fit i be currently use some old siemens behind the ear aid which keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desire recently i have an opportunity to test the widex q8 behind the ear aid for several week these have four independent program which be intend to be customize for different hearing situation and can be reprogramed i found them to be a definite improvement over my current aid and be about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system call resound unfortunately i be only able to try the resound aid in their office for about 30 minute and i could n t compare them  head to head with the widex nevertheless it do appear to me that they be superior and i be impressed by what i be able to read about the theory behind them which i will give in a separate post they also carry the widex aid and have one patient presumably wealthy who decide to go ahead and get the resound even though he have purchase the widex only 6 month ago the problem be that the resound aid be about twice a expensive a the widex and other programmable aid i could take a trip to europe on the difference be a lover of bargain and hat to spend money i be have a hard time persuade myself to go with the resounds i would appreciate any opinion on this and other hearing aid and projection about when and if i might see improvement in technology that be n t quite so expensive

 in article enea1 270493135255 enea apple com can anyone out there tell me the difference between a    persistent    disease and a    chronic    one for example persistent hepatitis v chronic hepatitis i do n t think there be a general distinction rather there be two class of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis i ca n t think of any other disease where the term persistent be use with or in preference to chronic much a these two term    chronic active    and    chronic persistent    sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two condition be often fairly fuzzy a well i beg to differ chronic  active  hepatitis implies that the disease remains active and generally lead to liver failure at the very minimum the patient have persistently elevate liver enzyme what some call    transaminitis    chronic  persistant  hepatitis simply mean that the patient have hbsag in his her blood and can transmit the infection but show no evidence of progressive disease if i have to choose i  d much rather have the persistant type
 point 1 i  m begin to see that  part  of the disagreement about the whole    yeast issue    be on differ perception and on differ meaning of word medical doctor have a very specific and specialized    jargon    necessary for precise communication within their field which i  m fully cognizant of since i too speak    jargonese    when with my peer for the situation in sci med many time the word or phrase use by doctor can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word use in the world at large cause significant miscommunication one example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion be the exact meaning of    systemic    it be now obvious to me that the meaning of this word be very specific much more so than it meaning to a non doctor there be also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctor and non doctors come together on essentially equal term which when combine with the jargon issue can far fan the flame this be probably the first time that practice doctor get really    beat up    by non doctors for their view on medicine which they otherwise do n t see much of in their practice except for the occasional    difficult    patient point 2 i understand the viewpoint among many practice doctor that they will not prescribe any treatments therapies for their patient unless such treatment have be show to be effective and the risk understood from well constructed clinical trial usually double blind or that such treatments therapies be part of an approve and fund clinical trial to these doctor to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice and it follow that any therapy not on the    accepted    list be therefore a non  therapy it do not even exist nor do the underlie hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sound very plausible by extrapolation of what be currently know anecdotal evidence have no value either from a treatment point of view and by and large a a scientist myself i be glad that medical practice  science take such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however a also be a human be last i checked and have be one of those people that have be significantly help by a currently unaccepted treatment where    standard    medicine be not able to help me have cause me to sit back and wonder if hold such an extreme and rigid    scientific    viewpoint be in itself unethical from humanitarian consideration after all the underlie intent of the    scientific    approach to medicine be to protect the health of the patient by provide the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when consider treatment what we need be a slightly modify approach to treatment that satisfies both the    scientific    and the    humanitarian    viewpoint in an earlier post i outline a crazy idea for do just that the gist of it be to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapy maybe support by anecdotal evidence for patient who  all  avenue of accepted therapy have be exhaust and not until then the patient would be fully inform that such therapies treatments be not support by the proper clinical trial and that there be real potential risk with real possibility of no benefit derive from them this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfies the humanitarian need of the patient and the reality be that many patient who have reach a dead end in the treatment of their symptom use accepted medicine  will  go outside the orthodox medical community either to the doctor who be brave enough to prescribe such treatment at the risk of lose their license or bad to non doctors who have not have the proper medical training this approach also recognizes this reality and keep the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefit that the information glean could help focus limited resource towards future clinical trial in the most productive way everybody win in this admittedly rose colored approach i m sure there be real problem with this approach a well it be present more a a strawman to stimulate discussion hopefully what i write here may give the sci med doctor a well idea a to why i be    open    to alternative therapy a well a why i have real difficulty read    apparent hostility    with the    coldness    of the 99 9 pure    scientific    approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medical treatment be one where both the    humanitarian    aspect be balance with and by the    scientific    aspect anything else be just not good medicine imho just my  nf leaning i guess comment jon noring    charter member    infj club
 edta chelation therapy have be use by some physician to try to remove calcium from calcify plaque in the arterial system not approve for such use there be also the possibility that lung tissue in patient with lung disease have become calcify chest x ray would show this there be side  effects to the use of edta because it be not specific for calcium it also bind other mineral i think that there have be some death when edta chelation therapy have be use because of mineral imbalance that be not detect and correct in animal study the best way to remove calcium from plaque in rabbit be to supplement the rabbit with vitamin c and magnesium rabbit already synthesize their own vitamin c the extra vitamin c be give in their diet to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaque the calcification process that occurs in both plaque and the lung probably can be prevent if magnesium be use in supplemental form most patietns with calcium deposit be found to be deficient in calcium 1    magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease a review    be j clin nutr 27 1  59 79 1974 supplementation with magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessel 2    the importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular disease    be heart j 94 649 57 1977 the need to measure the serum concentration in all patient with heat disease can not be overemphasize this be a review article 3    effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis in cholesterol fed rabbit    atherosclerosis 10 732 7 1990 magnesium supplementation greatly decrease the formation of plaque in rabbit feed a diet that have 1 by weight cholesterrol add to their normal food since edta will also bind magnesium i  ve never really like it  s use for the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patient
 when kid stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade infection incidence be much low because exposure be low some study suggest that early exposure to various infectious disease be probably beneficial because exposure a an adult carry much more risk of morbitity and mortality mumps measles etc  daycare will always carry a high exposure risk than home care exposure to infectious organism do build immunity but many virus mutate and reexposure to the new strain require another immune response new antibody production in addition antibody level tend to decline with time and re innoculation be need to keep the antibody level high chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this be rare and very unlikely to occur in child yes chronic use of antibiotic can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that be suppose to be present in and on the body health effect of this depletion of the good bacteria be a very hotly debate topic in the medical community with most physician seem to discount any health effect of chronic antibiotic use a view that i do not support chronic infection in an adult or a child need to be work up in my opinion but most physician feel that chronic infection in a child be normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious disease i do not share this view and there be some physician who also suspect that diet play a big role in infection frequency and severity exposure to an infectious agent do not have to result in a severe infection a strong immune response can minimize the length of time need to deal with the infection a well a the symptom associate with the infection there be five major nutrient that be responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agent they be protein vitamin c vitamin a iron and zinc the american diet be not low in protein so this be rarely a problem but vitamin a vitamin c iron and zinc be often low and this lack of an adequate pool nutrient reserve can impair the immune response iron be know to be low in most kid a be vitamin a there be distinct biochemical test that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrient in a patient who be have a problem with chronic severe infection serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin a status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin c status i have attempt to work up post on these five nutrient and their role in infection for this news group a well a the others that i participate in i can e mail you what i  ve work up so far but my best advice to you be to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet play in the human immune response you may also be able to get help from a nutritionist anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull you want to find someone like myself who have have some formal training and education in nutrition many ph d  program in the u s  now offer degree in nutrition and that  s what you need to look for some dietician will also call themselves nutritionist but most dietician have not have the biochemical training need to run specialized nutritional assessment test they be very good for get general dietary advice from however
 one of the responsibility of a license physician be to read the medical literature to keep up with change in medical practice all the clamor over laetril result in the nci spending quite a bit of money on clinical trial which prove to me anyway that laetril be ineffective against cancer a physician who continued to use it when well more effective treatment be available may deserve to be call a quack anti fungals be in a different class the big question seem to be be it reasonable to use them in patient with gi distress or sinus problem that  could  be due to candida bloom follow the use of broad spectrum antibiotic gorden rubenfeld through e mail have assure me that most physician recognize the chance of candida bloom occur after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patient with  good  bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this be yet a standard part of medical practice he deal with critical care patient where fungal infection systemic be a real problem and just because he try to keep  good  bacteria in his patient do not mean that all physician do this i think that aspergillis be more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membrane than be candida woman have be know for a very long time to suffer from candida bloom in the vagina and a woman be lucky to find a physician who be willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal cream since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptom should be more common than vaginal problem after broad spectrum antibiotic use the problem we have here david be proof that gi discomfort can be cause by a candida bloom the arguement be that without proof no action be warrented medicine have not and probalby never will be practice this way there have always be the use of conventional wisdom a very good example be kidney stone conventional wisdom because clinical trail have not be do to come up with an effective prevention be that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalate be the best way to prevent kidney stone from form clinical trial focus on drug or ultrasonic blast to breakdown the stone once it form through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom be wrong increase calcium intake be well at prevent stone formation than be restrict calcium intake the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry have be that animal need to be reinnoculated with  good  bacteria after come off antibiotic therapy if it make sense for livestock why do n t it make sense for human david we be not talk about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this be a standard part of medical practice a gordon r  say it be then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infection should decline

 candida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinical trial for candida bloom would involve give woman with chronic vaginal candida bloom l  acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida bloom in the vagina since most of the candida seem to be migrate in from the anal region and l  acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen just like it do in the vagina a much stuff a there be in the lay press about l  acidophilus and vaginal yeast infection i  m really amaze that someone have not do a clinical trial yet to check it out the calcium and kidney stone story be not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be if conventional wisdom have not be use to develop many of the standard medical practice that could not be confirm through clinical trial the clinical trial be a very new arrival on the medical scene and a very important one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use be important to the health of a patient be no reason to dismiss it out of hand especially if reinnoculation can be do cleaply and safely like it be in animal husbandry
 money probably have a lot to do with keep the practice of routine circumcision alive     it  s another opporitunity to charge a few hundred extra buck for a completely unnecessary procedure the rationale for which until recently have be accepted without question by most parent of newborn one could also imagine that complication arise from circumcision infection sloppy job etc be far more common than the remote chance of penile cancer it be purport to prevent

 well i think you might want to visit a doctor who be familiar with sleep disturbance because antihistamine only help induce sleep when they  re use intermittently they lose their sedative effect if they re use on a nightly basis their anticholinergic effect dry of secretion relax effect on smooth muscle can be problematic in some people such a those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement antihistamine like diphenhydramine benadryl or doxylamine unisom be potent sedative which be useful occasionally chlorpheniramine chlor trimeton be say to be less sedative but 8mg seem to work well in some people both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half lives compare to diphenhydramine and so may produce a residual hangover or    drug    feel the next morning
 if i prescribe itraconazole for a patient  s sinusitis neither the ama fda state licensing board nor abfp will be knock on my door to ask why this be a specious argument among other thing how to evaluate new theory and treatment funny i thought it meant    one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effect to be achieve by the treatment he offer    dorland s 27th certainly more precision than conveyed by    chronic yeast    the inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous representation be far more frighten it be fraud to promote a treatment where the evidence for it be either lack or against it and the quacksalver know so or error if the honest practitioner do n t know so failure to speak out against either bespeaks incompetency may i reply seriously that if the practitioner and proponent of non scientific medicine have left their mind so open that the part of their brain that do critical evaluation have fall out they should learn to edit their newsgroup header to conform to the exist hierarchy and division
 this question come up in sci med nutrition and i  m post my answer here only 22 medical school in the u s  teach course on human nutrition we have already see what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stone present themselves to the medical community i think that the best example of where u s  medicine be really miss the mark when it come to a knowledge of nutrition be pm so many woman and their husband suffer from this disorder that it be really criminal that most physician in the u s  be not taught that pm be primarily cause by diet and diet change can prevent it from ever happpening before shoot your flame read the entire article and then decide if flame be justified from a poster in sci medi nutrition side tracked with candida pm be a lot like candida bloom most physician do n t recognize it a a specific    disease    entity here be everything that you would ever want to know about pm premenstrual syndrome have be divide into four specific subgroup pmt a

blood estrogen level and low progesterone level during the luteal phase of a woman  s cycle pmt c be cause by the ingestion of large amount of refine simple carbohydrate during the luteal phase of a woman  s cycle there be increase glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge the metabolic finding believe to be responsible for pmt c be a low magnesium and a low

 the follow article by columnist mike royko be his humorous commentary on some of the public  s perception of doctor and their salary i hope some of you will find it a amuse a i do ____________________________________________________________________________ reprint w o permission    there  s no cure for stupidity of poll on doctor salary    by mike royko tribune medium service on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctor earnings be right up there it almost score a perfect brain dead 10  it be commission by some whiny consumer group call family usa the poll tell u that the majority of american believe that doctor make too much money the pollster also ask what a fair income would be for physician those poll say oh about 80 000 a year would be ok  how generous how sport how stupid why be this poll stupid because it be base on resentment and envy two emotion that ran hot during the political campaign and be still simmer you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns 100 000 plus and get the same result since the majority of american do n t make those buck they assume that those who do be steal it from them maybe the berlin wall come down but do n t kid yourself karl marx life it  s also stupid because it do n t ask key question such a do you know how much education and training it take to become a physician if those poll say no they do n t know then they should have be disqualify if they give the wrong answer they should have be drop what good be their view on how much a doctor should earn if they do n t know what it take to become a doctor or maybe a question should have be phrase this way    how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grade and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by a good college and spend four year take course heavy in math physic chemistry and other lab work and maintain a 3 5 average or well and c spend four more year of grind study in medical school with the third and fourth year in clinical training work 80 to 100 hour a week and d spend another year a a low pay hard work intern and e put in another three to 10 year of post graduate training depend on your specialty and f maybe wind up 100 000 in debt after medical school and g then work an average of 60 hour a week with many family doctor put in 70 hour or more until they retire or fall over    a you have probably guess by now i have considerably more respect for doctor than do the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyer and insurance executive they have call together to remake america  s health care base on what doctor contribute to society they be far more useful than the power happy ego tripping program spewing social tinkerer who will probably give u a medical plan that be to health what clinton  s first budget be to frugality but propaganda work and a the stupid poll indicates many american wrongly believe that profiteer doctor be the major cause of high medical cost of course doctor be well compensated they should be american now live longer than ever but who be responsible for our longevity    lawyer congress or the guy flip burger in a mcdonald  s and the doctor prolong our life despite our have become a nation of self indulgent lard butted tv gaping couch cabbage ah that be not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of try to turn the medical profession into a villain    let u talk about medical care and one of the big problem we have that problem be you my fellow american yes you eat too much and eat the wrong food many of you guzzle too much hooch still puff away at 2 50 a pack get your daily exercise by lumber from the fridge to the microwave to the couch do dope and bring crack baby into the world fill the big city emergency room with gunshot victim engage in unsafe sex and catch a deadly disease while blame the world for not find an instant cure    you and your habit not the doctor be the single big health problem in this country if anything it be amaze that the doc keep you alive a long a they do    in fact i do n t understand how they can stand look at your blubbery bod all day    so a your president i call upon you to stop whine and start living cleanly now i must go get myself a triple cheesy  greasy with double fry do a i say not a i do    but for those who truly believe that doctor be overpaid there be another solution do n t use them that  s right you do n t feel well then try one of those spine popper needle twirler or have rev bubba lay his hand upon your head and declare you fit or there be the do it yourself approach you have chest pain then sit in front of a mirror make a slit here a slit there and pop in a couple of valve you  re go to have a kid why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a well car and a big house than you will ever have while pay more in tax and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn just have the kid the old fashioned way squat and do it and if it survives you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it it shot by the way have anyone ever do a poll on how much pollster should earn royko be a pulitzer prize winning columnist for tribune medium service

 the burden of proof rest upon those who claim the existence of this    syndrome    to date these claim be unsubstantiated by any available data hopefully a a scientist you would take issue with anyone overstate their conclusion base upon their data gee i have many interest and enlighten anecdote about myself my friend and my family but in the practice of medicine i expect and demand more rigorous rationale for base therapy than    aunt susie  s brother in law        anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis but rarely prof anything in a positive sense and unlike mathematics boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issue and so evidence of  exceptions do not usually disprove but rather modifies current concept of disease i would characterize it not a  abject disbelief but rather  scientific outrage over vastly overstate conclusion i have no problem with such an approach but this be not what be happen in the  trenches of this diagnosis
 you  ve ask a toughie of a question there be many different drug which be use for chemotherapy the overall purpose of chemotherapy do n t worry about the spell some of these crazy medical word be impossible to spell be to either destroy cancer cell or to keep them from grow different drug have different effect on cancer cell and therefore it be not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time some chemotherapeutic drug be effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell others work only at specific time during the cell cycle the first phase of the cell cycle be g1 it be when the protein synthesis and rna systhesis occurs in the second phase s synthesis of dna occurs the third phase be g2 the dna split and rna and protein be synthesize aagain in the fourth phase m or mitosis the cell may divide there be drug which be effective in each phase some stop dna synthesis others stop the cell from divide others wreck protein synthesis at any rate the end result that be be sought be for the cancer cell to stop grow if what you be seek be    practical    advice i apologize for ramble on the techno stuff some side effect be pretty common chemo drug be rather nasty it can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomit thing to help this include eat small frequent meal it be also suggest that if nausea vomiting hereafter know a n v occurs that the person notify the doctor there be medicine tthat help nausea diarrhea can be an effect antidiarrheal medication can be give and good skincare and fluid intake be important probably the one of big concsern be hair loss this do not always happen it depends on what drug be be give and on the person themself different people take the same drug can and do have different side effect i have see some literature which state that wear a snug headband and or wear an ice cap can help reduce hair loss presumably by reduce blood flow to the scalp if anyone have see research on this too i would love to see it and possibly some bib data i highly recommend make contact with the american cancer society they have a vast selection of literature and information in addition if your friend have have a mastectomy i highly recommend    reach for recovery    it be a support group comprise entirely of woman who have lose a breast because of cancer they can offer some excellent support and suggestion if you have far question please send me e mail i hav some good access to information and i enjoy try to help other people

          i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infection i can understand the skepticism of those who see this associate with various general kind of symptom while there be a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and cause such general symptom to understand this skepticism one only need to know of past failure that share these characteristic with the notion of hidden candida infection there have be quite a few and the proponent of all thought that the skeptic be overly skeptical on the other hand i be happy to read that some people be sufficiently interested in this possibility spur by suggestive clinical experience to research it far the doubter may be surprised it have happen before i realize that admit ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who be so sure they know one way or another and indeed perhaps some of them do know    i be the one who be currently ignorant but i find this the most honest route and so i be happy with it

 ron you be absolutely right not all kidney stone have calcium and not all calcium stone be calcium oxalate but the vast majority be calcium  oxalate calcium be just one piece of the puzzle i cite that nejm article a a way of point out to some of the physician in this group that conventional wisdom be use in medicine always have be and probably always will be if one us conventional wisdom there be a chance that you will be wrong a long a the error be not go to cause a lot of damage what  s the big deal why call a physician who give anti fungals to sinus suffers or gi distress patient a quack on the kidney stone problem i  d want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab balance be much more important than the dietary intake of calcium i know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body i know that you do n t think that the serum level for mineral be very useful i agree if i can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where i can actually measure the tissue reserve for mineral i  d like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compare with mine
 david this study look like a good one gordon rubenfeld do a medline search and also sent me the same reference through e mail since commercial yogurt do not always have a good lactobacillus a  or bulgaricus culture a negative find would not have be too informative this be often the reason why lactobacillus acidophilus tablet be recommend rather than yogurt i guess the next question be why would this introduction of    good    bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida bloom if the anus be not serve a a candida reservoir a fact that gordon r  vehementy denys i see two possible theory one the l  acidophilus which be a facultatively anaerobic bacterium could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida this would not explain the reoccurance of candida bloom in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion be stop though the other be that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida loos it  s major food source get lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract where it be normally found would have a much well effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast bloom though an acetic acid lactobacillus acidophilus douche have be use to get this effect but i  ve not see any such treatment report in the medical literature this would be an example of physician conduct their own clinical trial to try to come up with treatment that help their patient when this be do in private practice the result be rarely if ever publish it be the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerge with clinical trial it really raise a big question do the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatment to help patient or do it look the other way this particular issue be really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy be involve even the anti fungals be not all that dangerous but there be some area like edta chelation therapy where the fire be pretty hot and somebody could get burn it  s really tough do i follow only well establish protocol and then give up if they do n t work that well or do it try something that look like it will work but have n t be proven to work yet my stand be to consider other treatment possibility especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient get good bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment be one treatment possibility the other be get l  acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who be have a problem with recur yeast infection

source mmwr 42 15 date apr 23 1993 cesarean delivery have account for nearly 1 million of the approximately 4 million annual delivery in the united state since 1986 table 1 the cesarean rate in the united state be the third high among 21 reporting country exceed only by brazil and puerto rico 1 this report present data on cesarean delivery from cdc  s national hospital discharge survey nhds for 1991 and compare these data with previous year data on discharge from short stay nonfederal hospital have be collect annually since 1965 in the nhds conduct by cdc  s national center for health statistic for 1991 medical and demographic information be abstract from a sample of 274 000 inpatient discharge from 484 participate hospital the 1991 cesarean and vaginal birth after a prior cesarean vbac present in this report be base on weight national estimate from the nhds sample of approximately 31 000 11 woman discharge after delivery the estimate number of live birth by type of delivery be calculate by apply cesarean rate from the nhds to live birth from national vital registration data therefore estimate of the number of cesarean in this report will not agree with previously publish data base solely on the nhds 2 state difference in this analysis be significant at the 95 confidence level base on the two tailed t test with a critical value of 1 96  in 1991 there be 23 5 cesarean per 100 delivery the same rate a in 1990 and similar to rate during 1986 1989 table 1 the primary cesarean rate i e  number of first cesarean per 100 delivery to woman who have no previous cesarean for 1986 1991 also be stable range from 16 8 to 17 5  in 1991 the cesarean rate in the south be 27 6 significantly p 0 05 high than the rate for the west 19 8 midwest 21 8 and northeast 22 6 rate be high for mother age great than or equal to 30 year than for young woman in proprietary hospital than in nonprofit or government hospital in hospital with few than 300 bed than in large hospital and for delivery for which blue cross blue shield and other private insurance be the expect source of payment than for other source of payment table 2 the same pattern characterize primary cesarean delivery since the early 1970s the number and percentage of birth to old woman increase however if the age distribution of mother in 1991 have remain the same a in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have be 23 3 essentially the same a the 23 5 observe base on the nhds of the approximately 4 111 000 live birth in 1991 an hicnet medical newsletter page 1 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 estimate 966 000 23 5 be by cesarean delivery of these an estimate 338 000 35 0 birth be repeat cesarean and 628 000 65 0 be primary cesarean since 1986 approximately 600 000 primary cesarean have be perform annually in 1986 8 5 of woman who have a previous cesarean deliver vaginally compare with 24 2 in 1991  of all cesarean in 1991 35 0 be associate with a previous cesarean 30 4 with dystocia i e  failure of labor to progress 11 7 with breech presentation 9 2 with fetal distress and 13 7 with all other specify complication the average hospital stay for all delivery in 1991 be 2 8 day in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery be 4 5 day and for a repeat cesarean 4 2 day    nearly twice the duration for vbac delivery 2 2 day or for vaginal delivery that be not vbacs 2 3 day in 1986 the average hospital stay for all delivery be 3 2 day for primary cesarean 5 2 day for repeat cesarean 4 7 day and for vbac and non vbac vaginal delivery 2 7 and 2 6 day respectively report by office of vital and health statistic system national center for health statistic cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united state steadily increase from 1965 through 1986 however the finding in this report indicate that rate have be stable since 1986 3 because there be little evidence that maternal and child health status have improve during this time and because cesarean be associate with an increase risk for complication of childbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 be to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or few per 100 delivery and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or few per 100 delivery objective 14 8 postpartum complication    include urinary tract and wound infection    may account in part for the longer hospital stay for cesarean delivery than for vaginal birth 5 moreover the prolong hospital stay for cesarean delivery substantially increase health care cost for example in 1991 the average cost for cesarean and vaginal delivery be 7826 and 4720 respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery include 611 for physician fee and 2495 for hospital charge 6 if the cesarean rate in 1991 have be 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 23 5 the number of cesarean birth would have decrease by 349 000 617 000 versus 966 000 result in a saving of more than 1 billion in physician fee and hospital charge despite the

apply objective criterion for the four most common indication for cesarean delivery by require a second opinion and by institute a peer review process 10 other recommendation for decrease cesarean delivery rate include eliminate incentive for physician and hospital by equalize reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean delivery public dissemination of physician  and hospital specific cesarean delivery rate to increase public awareness of difference in practice and address malpractice concern which may be an important factor in maintain the high rate of cesarean delivery 4 reference 1

topic discuss be the epidemiology of hiv lesion ethic professional responsibility and public policy occupational issue provision of oral care to the hiv positive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infection pediatric hiv infection and woman  s issue recommendation recommendation emerge from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesion and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesion to look for more effective treatment for oral manifestation to expand molecular biology study to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesion and to study the effect of hiv therapy on oral lesion epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral

more be appear all the time researcher be continue to document the epidemiology of oral lesion such a hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also be begin to explore the relationship between specific oral lesion and hiv disease progression and prognosis social political issue discussion on the social and political implication of hiv infection focus on change the public  s attitude that aid be retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speaker also address health care delivery for hiv infected patient and the need to educate the public about what aid be and how it be acquire saliva and salivary gland conference speaker described transmission issue and the hiv inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretion whole saliva have a great inhibitory effect than submandibular secretion which in turn have a great inhibitory effect than parotid secretion research have show that at least two mechanism be responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attribute the hiv inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1 aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reach a target cell and 2 direct effect on the virus or target cell other topic discuss be the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv infected person and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issue pediatric aid recently have emerge a an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hiv  infect child have triple the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many case particularly if the mother  s sero status be know prior to give birth periodontal and gingival tissue disease hicnet medical newsletter page 12 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 oral health researcher continue to explore periodontal disease and gingivitis found in individual with hiv infection recommendation make at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic marker standardization of study design and proper consideration of confound variable result from periodontal therapy occupational and treatment issue occupational issue surround the treatment of hiv infected individual and treatment render by hiv infected health care professional still command considerable attention factor under consideration include the cost benefit of hiv test patient to health care provider transmission of hiv infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicate facility for the treatment of hiv infected patient conference participant anticipate that a third international workshop on the oral manifestation of hiv infection will be held in five year or less proceeding from the

 there be two different mechanism here tone of muscle and reduction of fat exercise specific to particular muscle will tone only those muscle exercise example look at difference in arm circumference between pitch arm and non pitching arm in major league pitcher however if exercise also lead to reduction of body fat the loss of body fat will be equally distribute over the entire body there be no way to    spot reduce    body fat other than surgically through liposuction distribution of body fat be genetically determine sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like    fat    so when that muscle gain some muscle tone it may  appear  a though the    fat    be    change    into    muscle    but really fat and muscle tissue be totally separate and one do not ever    change into    the other
