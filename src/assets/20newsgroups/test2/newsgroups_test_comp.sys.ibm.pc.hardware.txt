b"note followup to comp.dcom.modems for obvious reason the courier be their top-of-the-line product thus the high price i've never take a real look at the sportster line only courier but from what i 've gather it 's basically more of an entry-level modem probably do n't meet the same specification that the courier do i 'm not sure if the sportster line be fully dsp driven like the more recent courier modem be so upgrade in the future may be an issue again take all of the above with a grain of salt ... i 've never evaluate the sportster so i 'm go by bit and piece that i 've heard if you want a real answer post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you 'll find people who have work with the sportster personally though if i be go to look at the courier modem i'd buy the dual standard ... then i 'd get both hst and v.32bis in fact this be exactly what i do i 'm sit here look at my usr d right now and now to correct a few very incorrect statement ... folk if you want to get reliable answer to modem and/or uart question post them to comp.dcom.modems if you post in other group you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer you may very well get a good answer ... or you may get something like the one below at least in cdm if someone post complete and utter b you 'll see a flurry of folk correct them to avoid spread faulty info just a it do at low speed too there be absolutely nothing in either ccitt recommendation v.42 or v.42bis that say that they can only operate on modem that be run v.32bis v.42bis of course be currently only *standardized* for operation on top of v.42 in it primary mode of operation lapm but that 's about a far a that go and just in case there 's some confusion on this v.42/v.42bis be also support by the courier line unless you have a really ancient one take a second look at the original question ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the v.32bis up there the question be not about the courier hst modem or about the courier dual standard ... it be about the courier v.32bis modem the modem in question do not support hst period it therefore do not support the 16.8 kb hst also not all courier hst courier dual standard modem support the 16.8 kb version of hst my dual standard only support hst at 14.4 kb there be even old model that only run hst at 9.6 kb hst be usr 's proprietary modulation scheme ... but we 're not talk about hst we 're talk about v.32bis v.32bis be most definitely *not* a proprietary modulation scheme i do hope you do n't mean for these two sentence to be related in some way ... .. first off v.32 and v.32bis be both synchronous and asynchronous this be part of the ccitt recommendation i.e. part of the standard it be n't a feature unique to the sportster i just look at the appropriate chapter in the courier d manual second hst be not `` one way only '' more correctly put it be an asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it do n't work at the same speed in both direction hst operates at 9.6 14.4 16.8 in one direction and have a low-speed back-channel in the other direction the high-speed channel go in the direction of the high data flow this be fine if you 're log on to say a bb and type one letter and get screen of info back transfer file not use bimodem etc ... there be of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel need to reverse direction v.32 and v.32bis be both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both direction at the same time third synchronous v asynchronous have absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical v asymmetrical ... they be two completely different topic again more correctly put *some* of the courier line will be upgradeable to whatever `` v.fast '' be call when it 's complete if you have the large footprint courier modem like i do you 're s.o.l ... .. there be an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgraded to support v.fast but the cost of the two upgrade together pretty much put it high than just buying a new modem later ... .. -- jim -- include std_disclaimer.h 73 de n5ial /4 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- internet jim n5ial.mythical.com j.graham ieee.org icbm 30.23n 86.32w amateur radio n5ial w4zbb ft. walton beach fl amtor selcal nial"

b'in case anyone be wonder about upgrade their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money i look into replace the processor on those machine and here be the fact a i understand them if you have a ps/2 model 70 or model 80 you can replace the i386 chip with either 1 a cyrix 486dlc chip for 130 which will increase your processing power by about 60 for normal fuctions and not at all for math function this chip will only run at your original clock speed ie if you have a 16mhz machine the cyrix 486dlc will run at 16mhz note window do not use the math function so it be a good upgrade if you be run window or 2 you can get a kingston 486/now platform for 450 with a 25mhz i486sx on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100 if you be run at 25mhz originally but again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions i think that it will continue to run at 25mhz even if your original processor run at a slow speed there be also 3 the kingston 486/now platform for 750 with a 33mhz i486dx on it this might speed up your math function a well but i be not sure if you have a ps/2 model 70 b21 or other ps/2 machine with either an i486sx or a non-clock double i486dx ie it run at either 25 or 33mhz in it then you can get an intel overdrive chip which be really an i486dx2 chip and replace your chip with it you should get about 95 well preformance for both normal and math function the 25/50 mhz version of the overdrive chip cost 450 and the 33/66mhz version cost 700 the replacement for the 25mhz 486sx chip be an espeacially good deal a it provide the math coprocessor which the 486sx do not have note that the speed rating on the overdrive chip be the maximum speed at which they can run if you have a 20mhz 486sx then the overdrive chip will run at 20/40mhz ie 20mhz externally and 40mhz internally there be no reason to buy an overdrive chip which be rat at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance you should be able to buy these chip from any of the microchip merchant that advertise at the back of pc magazine or pc week you might want to shop around a price do vary if you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip e-mail me and i will respond with a couple of source lawrence khoo'

b"it seem that there be a lot of question regard the cyrix 386 compatible 486dlc and 486dru2 my info come directly from cyrix 's fast fax service and also from instal one of these chip in an ibm model 80. the 486dlc be a 486 instruction set compatible cpu which fit into a 386dx socket pin grid array or pga the dlc currently be available in 3 speed the 25 the 33 and the 40. they do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc a present i guess they emulate the coproc instruction math function be on the 386dx level without the actual coprocessor the internal cache on the 486dlc be 1k cyrix literature claim a 85 hit rate my informal test show that the cache account for a 10 performance boost when it be enable by software overall performance boost from a 386dx-25 to a 486dlc-25 be about 60 the benchmark i use be nu si and qaplus dhrystones and whetstone the performance with the cache enable be about on a par with my 386dx-40 with 256k external cpu cache which be around the performance for a 486sx-25 the computer run noticebly faster and do 6 with dblspace be not complain the company claim os/2 compatibility but i do n't test it the 486dru2 be not a chip a commonly thought the 486dru2 be actually a small daughterboard slightly large than the 386dx which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler this board plug into the 386dx pga and the 486dlc-33 or 40 plug into this board i guess the board double the frequency apparent to the cpu and insert wait state when access to the rest of the system be require there be no info available from cyrix there anyway the dru2 be available for 386dx-16 and 386dx-20 only double these clock rate and you get the 32mhz and the 40mhz dlcs if cyrix be planning to do the same thing for the dru2-50 then they need to put out the 50mhz dlc2 first ... i also test a dlc33 motherboard along with a cyrix coprocessor with 64k external cache performance be about 30 faster than the 25 but still significantly 25 slow than an actual intel 486dx imho the dlc be a great low price upgrade for people who ca n't afford or ca n't install a new motherboard it be definitely worth what i paid for it but if you need 486dx-33 performance the dlc33 wo n't cut it i 'm not sure about the dlc-40 but i think even if it match the performance it won't beat it in any significant way the last time i post info about the dlc people sent quite a bit of mail ask where i get it so here be where i get mine treasure chest peripheral they advertise in the computer shopper 1-800-677-9781 the 486dlc-25 kit be 179.00 but ... i like the chip so much that i found the supplier and become a dealer if you be interested in the chip e-mail me and i can fax or mail you more info i 'm well aware of the net 's policy against commercial use so i can t post anymore info here however if there be more question regard the 486dlc itself i 'll post what i can jamesc 909-396-0408"

understand about rs-232 and null modem but you should still check your software i will eplain a couple of detail of rs-232 rs-232 be a commumications specification for communicate between a computer

voltage level the connector type the pinouts and the signal protocol the connector be a `` db-25 '' but ibm have set an alternative `` standard '' of db-9 the primary signal be transmit data td recieve data rd and signal ground sg there be other signal that provide control between the dte and the dce for example the dte announces that it be power up and ready to participate in communication via the data terminal ready dtr signal dtr be an output on the dte and an input on the dce similarly the dce announces that it be ready to participate in communication via the data set ready dsr signal dsr be an input on the dte and an output on the dce ok that's five signal there be only four more of interest the request to send rts signal be an output from the dte and an input to the dce that be use to ask the dce permission to send data if the dce agrees it sends an ok via the clear to send ct signal for completeness the ct be an input to the dte and an output from the dce the other two signal of interest be ring indicator ri and data carrier detect dcd these be both input to the dte and output from the dce ri be just what you would expect a signal to the dte say that someone be attempt to establish a connection to the dce this be rather specific to the modem telephone line setup dcd be a way for the dce to announce that the `` connection '' have be establish i.e the local dce be talk to some remote dce there that 's it oh there be many other rs-232 signal define but they be obsolete i have explain the nine signal that be on a pc the pinouts be a follow name db-9 db-25 sg 5 7 td 3 2 rd 2 3 dtr 4 20 dsr 6 6 dcd 1 8 rts 7 4 ct 8 5 ri 9 22 now to address your problem at hand when you connect a pc to a pc a dte to a dte there be no dce pair in the middle and therefore the rs-232 signal definition do n't work out quite right there be no dce to assert the ct dsr dcd or ri so the common thing to do be to not use these signal at all and also forget about the dtr and rts output a well if this be do you simply make a null modem a cable that pass through sg and cross td and rd i.e pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end etc the problem with this solution be that a pc that want to send data have no way of know if the other pc be ready it would have to just send the data and hope it get through therefore a well null modem would include the dtr/dsr pair cross a particular point a confusion be in the software area just because you run the wire do not mean that the soft- ware will use them if you be use the built-in bios to control the serial port then the bios dictate what wire you need and how they be to be use but if you have a comm package such a brooklyn bridge or lap- link or telix then those package dictate the cable requirement the only thing you can guess reliably be the sg td and rd the dtr/dsr be also fairly common there be one more issue that need to be address here and that be flow control in the rs-232 scenerio the dce 's be responsible for flow control and it be assume that the dce could n't possible over-run the dte by this i mean that a long a the dte have it dtr line assert the dce will send data without request permission first note the contrast to the other direction of data flow the dte must request permission by assert the rts line and it must wait for the ct signal before it can send and now in the dte to dte scenerio the question be do you need flow control the answser be usually but how for non-binary communication one common technique be xon xoff which be implement in software no wire be dedicate to flow control the td and rd carry the xon and xoff command this type of flow control can be use in addition to hardware flow control but the problem be that you ca n't send binary data because your data might include the xon or xoff code and cause erroneous conrol signal a work around be to have the software insert and extract `` escape '' code but the hardware flow control be prefer the problem with hard- ware flow control be that there be no standard there be lot of way to do it and i bet they have all be try one cornerstone of all the method be to use the rts/cts for one direction but beyond that anything be fair game again you must look to you comm package for cable requirement but i bet you 'll find that one cable if wire properly could work with all of the package a long a they be of the same vintage by the way i be familiar with one package that us rts/cts and dtr/dsr for flow control the rts be request to send and the dtr be ready to recieve the ct be the clear to send and the dsr be the request to recieve this do not mean a differnt cable it be just software the clincher to all of this cable stuff be that it be common to have the uart directly control by the ct signal which mean that the ct must be present even if you be not support- ing it in software for these case you will find cable that short the rts to the ct at the same end or perhaps the dtr to the ct other possible short might be do just because the software expect certain signal that you do n't have or do n't feel like provide because it would mean additional wire specifically i be talk about the dsr short the dtr to the dsr be not a good idea in general but you may find cable like this it be a bad idea because it defeat the whole purpose one more '' gotcha '' signal be the dcd some software include the pc bios expect to see the dcd before it will work this signal sometimes get short with the dtr but my favorite null modem have the rts and ct short at each end but the rts be also connect through to the other end and connect to dcd and of course the dtr/dsr be cross a be the td/rd and of course the sg must pas through this null modem work with most software the flow control if any can use the rts/dcd with the dtr/dsr if your comm package do not specify the cable require for pc to pc connection then i suggest you use this one td -- -- -- rd rd -- -- -- td dtr -- -- -- dsr dsr -- --

b"most likely reason be that your backup battery be fail this battery maintains the content of the cmos memory when ac power be turn off and if the battery be flakey then the content of the cmos will be lose and the checksum will be wrong along with most other of the cmos data try replace the battery if however your pc do n't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the cmos you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery if this be n't possible make sure you leave your pc on for a half hour or hour each day this will keep the capacitor charge i 'd opt for the battery change though"

b"hi i bought on the net here a mini-tower 386dx25 system it work fine but i have no doc on the motherboard do anyone know who a manufacturer name wpi be that be the only mark on the board that be not related to a chip/connector name it say c 1991 wpi also this board have a connector at the other end of the motherboard it look like this -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ batt 387 socket for 387 math coprocessor 386 386 chip be about here ========= ==== j sign be the isa slot ========= ==== m ========= p jumper for turbo/kb etc be where ========= ==== -- -- -- e marked ========= ==== -- -- -- r ========= ==== -- -- -- s sign be 8 bank of simm socket ========= ==== ========= ==== ======= these connector be the mystery -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ connector ^^^^ ^^^^^^^ what be this connector be this a place to plug an extra memory board in i 've see thatr mention in some motherboard doc some allow an 8-meg card and 8 meg in simms be this what it be for phil -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- phil hunt `` wherever you go there you be '' howtek inc"
b"i must say that i have be a customer of midwest micro for over 4 year now and have be well take care of on each purchase i have have many friend that have bought that same modem and they do have some experience with set up modem so there have be no problem in 6 of them that i know of the fact that your time to valuable for you to spend on the modem be where you go wrong why you say because i must tell you of the 12 yes i say 12 ppi modem that i have have in the past that i be try to use on my bb they all be junk and be replace 3 time each to ther point that i just say forget it and i want my money back ppi 's teck even say that they do n't even repair them that they just strip the part that be good and junk thr rest of the modem i think it be more your fault than midwest mirco 's faulkt ... sam"
b"discuss the use of irq 7 to put it a little differently irq 7 be the de facto standard interrupt assign to be use by the printer adapter to announce it completion of some activity do do n't monitor irq 7 it us other mean to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer most all hardware printer adapter have the ability to disable the use of irq 7 usually by merely break the connection between the isa pin and the associate driver other adapter control the irq line by a tri-state driver and by program just leave it in the high-impedence mode unfortunately there be a lot of adapter card which use bistate driver i.e. either assert high or assert low for the irq line rather than tristate driver assert high assert low or don't assert anything the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it be physically disconnect by a jumper incidentally note that there 's no requirement that a card hold the irq line low when no interrupt be desire if that be true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq line and that certainly be n't a requirement non-dos operating system os/2 nt various unices or whatever the proper plural of unix might be require the use of irq 7 for performance reason and the sb16 ala be one of the card which us bistate driver"
b"i need to be able to cause a beep but without use any interrupt routine a i can not use the bios i believe that the pic might have something to do with it but i 'm have trouble decipher the information i have on it to figure out how to program it i 'm program all of this in turbo c if that make any diference at all ... please can anyone help me thanks"

b"think it 's the scsi card do the dma transfer not the disk ... the scsi card can do dma transfer contain data from any of the scsi device it be attach when it want to an important feature of scsi be the ability to detach a device this free the scsi bus for other device this be typically use in a multi-tasking o to start transfer on several device while each device be seek the data the bus be free for other command and data transfer when the device be ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data on an ide bus when you start a transfer the bus be busy until the disk have seek the data and transfer it this be typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other process want the bus irrespective of transfer time"
b"close universal asynchronous receiver transmitter even if you be run do if your cpu ca n't handle the speed of the interrupt you will still lose character i have one 286/10 machine with an external 9600 bps modem attach and ca n't drive the serial port any faster than 19.2k without lose character rob"
b"no the simple 25 style ide controller do not use dma the cpu performs the data transfer with a string move instruction this require that the cpu stop what it have be do and transfer the data only the smart drive controller be they ide or scsi can transfer via dma these controller tend to cost the same wether they be ide or scsi to get the dma benefit ide must sacrifice it 's price advantage *on the controller* floppy be n't on the ide bus your arguement make no sense this isn't an ide issue the floppy have their own processor on their controller board which handle all of these command the difference between ide and scsi be that all scsi peripherials be intelligent they each have their own controller they depend on the cpu to do few thing for them i.e ide drive need a processor to transfer their data the dettach/callback mechanism alows the cpu to make request of the device on the scsi bus and then dettach and go about it business later when the device be do it issue a callback to say that the data have arrive or the function have complete most scsi card will also dma the data into memory without the interupting the cpu therefore allow it to continue work uninterupted ide support no such concept a dettach/callback can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system -- david willmore -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- willmore iastate.edu `` death before dishonor '' `` well dead than greek '' david willmore `` ever notice how much they look like orchid lovely ''"
b"hello i 'm look for a supplier of archive tape drive controlers european prefer who could provide me an sc400s card for my old 5945l-2 drive who know where i could find such a beast i thank you in advance for your attention ... i 'm similarly look for controller for archive 5945c even the number to contact archive or whatever the company be call would help"
b"i ran out of time on my last reply to this string and i don't know if it be sent or not but i have never heard of anyone that have to return something in the 30 grace peried that have a problem at all with midwest micro they may of thought that you didn't know what you be do and suggest how to correct the problem but it sound a you do n't give them much of a chance to correct thing at all the fact that the ppi work okay for you be because it be setup more for the no nothing user that ca n't understand the instruction and the command to configure it to his/her system when you find out thing like the fact the the ec lead that look like you have connect to another ec modem do n't realy say that but that it only tell you that you have ec turn on on your modem i think that these lead be nothing more that just light to hype up the product just like i bet someone take home a few extra in the last year for give the ppi modem the pc-magazine award of the year not so for the stash 12 of them that i saw on my test bench i could go on for hour at no end a to all of the problem that i found with the ppi modem but i will try to control myself i will not even go into the 6 week it take ppi to credit my card back for the modem after they have receive them back ... no i will not go into that one nor will i go into talk to the parent co. co from hayes i 'll just say i hope you like your new modem and maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get the one that you sent back maybe a good friend of mine i hope"
b"can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal width hide out on the tseng lab et4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac i be try to use the 640x480x16m mode under unix so i cant just call int 10h i have a program which dump the content of the card register under do but i be not sure i trust it for the extend register of the et4000 anyway the problem be that in this mode the horizontal total register 3d4h index0 be apparently set to 0x27 but 3d4h index 1 the displayed clock be set to 0xef so 0x27 be nonsense a resonable value would be 0x0127 so be there a high bit and if so where be it also how do one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency and what would be an appropriate frequency the documentation be n't really very clear tseng.txt from vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site about this my card be a megavga/1024 1mb card seem to have a tseng lab bios ver 8.05 i think work nicely under do and very well under unix linux in all the non-hicolor mode great for run x-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni if your monitor will take it only just in my case please email the answer a i ca n't read news very often"
