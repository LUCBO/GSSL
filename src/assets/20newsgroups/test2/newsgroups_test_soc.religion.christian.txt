 this thread si start to get really silly such nonsense do not belong in s r c and it really hurt me to read some of the post on this issue we chose to believe whetever we want but we be not allow to define our own christianity we see in part if you see something that i do not see or vice versa it do not give me the right to play joke on your belief there be no wonder that your    miracle    do not work you designet it yourself and even if you be able to collect a group of people like the one you describe i see no reason why your    miracle    should really happen god be the one who do miracle not human after all we be all on the same way or at least we be all head for the same goal follow different path remember that we be go to spend eternity together if i can not stand your view here on earth how can i possibly stand spending eternity together with you tongue be a question of belief not wether you believe in jesus but if you believe that he be able to give you this gift just a any other of the gift mention in the bible but there be no evidence in the bible that people who do not accept these gift be in any way well than others maybe some of the people who have receive spiritual gift be more interested in glorify themselves than glorify god i know but if this be the case it still do not suggest that the gift be fake in the bible you will find that jesus do not always do miracle he say that    i do nothing except what my father tell me    perhaps it woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that example in him bjorn

 on these count the apocrapha fall short of the glory of god to quote unger  s bible dictionary on the apocrapha 1  they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracy and anachronism 2  they teach doctrine which be false and foster practice which be at variance with sacred scripture 3  they resort to literary type and display an artificiality of subject matter and style out of keep with sacred scripture 4  they lack the distinctive element which give genuine scripture their divine character such a prophetic power and poetic and religious feel first to point out the obvious while 4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue one would be hard press to point to another book of the ot or for that matter the nt that on some issue in some way fail one or more of the first three of these test second one factor the deuterocanonicals share be the lateness of their composition i recall the exact date of all of the book but most    if not all    be write after the late of the canonical book i e daniel furthermore while the deuterocanonical may or may not have be originally write in greek they be clearly deeply _hellenistic_ in nature both of these feature probably figure heavily in the rejection of these book from the various canon these may not be strict and uniformly applicable criterion by which to judge the canonicity of these book but a these discussion have show i think the one thing we can see be that there _are_ no purely objective standard for determine canonicity
 larry thanks for the reply but this quite the same thing like i say before i can understand why non christians would be deny  access  to holy ceremony but the ceremony itself communion be not secret in fact all four gospel record the first    break of the bread    in some detail communion be a fellowship meal and it be and still should be in my opinion inappropriate to invite those who do not share in the fellowship of the body of christ the fact that unbeliever deny access to these communal meal begin to imagine all sort of secret and debase ritual during communion do not by any mean imply that the early christian be in fact hiding shameful thing from the general public in fact i think if you read some of the early church father you will find that they be not at all bashful about describe what go on during communion why it seem funny to me when mormon who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st century christianity insist on hiding certain ritual on the ground that they be    too sacred    mark
 from what i understand of my experience in look up this word and discuss it with a greek literate individual the meaning of the word be rather clear basically it literally mean    he who bed with a man    or    he who have sex with a man    the burden of proof be on the pro homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word have an idiomatic meaning nor evident from it literal meaning one can speculate all day long that it might mean something else but we need evidence before we create new doctrine and get rid of the historical understand of the meaning of this word link hudson
 this sound to me like a sort of generic modalism in the the three phase of water be but different mode of behavior of the same physical stuff it certainly do not seem to me to describe the orthodox position of course i suppose that the medieval view of water may have be different but now we know that the phase of water be just different  behaviors  of the same physical stuff different mode not different identity but perhaps the medieval people do not know that this be clearly modalistic monarchianism since these three aspect depend solely on point of view and be do not really represent actual variety within the person do you now begin to see why
     if we take thing this literally then we must also forbid woman from speak in church paul while lead by the holy spirit be human and could err i find it interest that christ never discuss the issue of homosexuality certainly it exist back then and if it be a serious transgression christ would have condemn it i find it disturb that the modern church spends it energy try to stamp out something that christ consider worth a single word of condemnation christ repeatedly warns u against judgement we risk    judgement in equal measure    when we condemn people who god himself do not judge when he walk on the earth    the love of christ be contagious
 protestant love to play up jerome for all he be worth they should remeber that after the decree of pope st  damsus i jerome do not hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon and quote them a scripture in his later writing and a i have already point out in a previous letter on this subject the catholic church have accepted the deuterocanon from the begin and the protestant in the 1500  s all of a sudden revive the old theory of some condemn by pope council and church that the deuterocanon be not inspire again why must the church of jesus christ adopt the canon of the unbelieving jew drawn up in jamnia in 90 ad in counter the christian use of the septuagint
 be there any member of conservative religious politically active group such a the christian coalition out there i come from a very liberal background and like to talk to some conservative people out there in a public forum such a this one i frankly understand the rationale or christian basis for much of the conservative position and like to try and learn more about this movement    after all part of the same church be anyone interested in explain a bit about the conservative viewpoint thanks
 the problem with this view be that the topic under discussion in this passage  is  marriage that be perform on earth jesus word seem to me to indicate that he regard his response a the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection this be the case the most straightforward interpretation in my opinion be that marriage do not exist in the next life because those who be raise be of a different nature than what we be now other  wise why would jesus offer    but be like the angel in heaven    a a contrast to the idea of the resurrect marry and be give in marriage we do not have angel like nature now but someday we shall and when we do our earthly marriage will be irrelevant or at least what i think jesus be say about the post resurrection validity of marriage perform on earth your mileage may vary
 cont dr  james deyoung 3 r  scroggs robin scroggs have built upon the discussion of his predecessor and suggest a new twist to the word scroggs believe that arsenokoitai be a    hellenistic jewish coinage perhaps influence by awareness of rabbinic terminology    the term be derive from lev 18    22 20 13 where the lxx juxtaposes the two word arsenos    male    and koiten    bed    and represent the hebrew miskab zabar    lie with a male    yet he believe that paul do not originate the term but borrow it from    circle of hellenistic jew acquaint with rabbinic discussion    180 n 14 it be invent to avoid    contact with the usual greek terminology    108 if this be true scroggs observes it explains why the word do not appear in greco roman discussion of pederasty and why later patristic writer avoid it it be meaningless to native speaking greek 108 scroggs take the second part a the active word and the first word a the object of the second part thus differ from boswell  s    learn discussion    107 yet scroggs understands the general meaning of    one who lie with a male    to have a very narrow reference with the precede malokoi i cor 6 9 which scroggs interprets a    the effeminate call boy    arsenokoitai be the active partner    who keep the malakos of the  mistress or who hire him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desire    108 hence arsenokoitai do not refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic model of pederasty it certainly can not refer to the modern gay model he affirms 109 this be scrogg  s interpretation of the term in i tim 1 10 also the combination of pornoi    fornicator    arsenokoitai and andrapodistai    slave dealer    refers to    male prostitute male who lie with them and slave dealer who procure them    120 it again refers to that specific form of pederasty    which consist of the enslave of boy a youth for sexual purpose and the use of these boy by adult male    121 even    serious mind pagan author    condemn this form of pederasty he then us these instance of arsenokoitai in i cor and i tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in rom 1  consequently paul    must have have could only have have pederasty in mind    122 we can not know what paul would have say about the    contemporary model of adult adult mutuality in same sex relation ship    122 in relate these term to the context and to contemporary ethical concern scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific item in the list of vice in i cor 6 have no deliberate intend meaning in paul the form and function of the catalogue of vice be traditional and stereotype any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context be usually nonexistent he concludes that paul    do not care about any specific item in the list    104 both on the basis of the meaning of the term and of the literary phenomenon of a    catalogue of vice    scroggs argues that the scripture be    irrelevant and provide no help in the heat debate today    129 the    model in today  s christian homosexual community be so different from the model attack by the nt    that    biblical judgment against homosexuality be not relevant to today  s debate they should no longer be use in denominational discussion about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination    127 reaction to the new interpretation of arsenokoitai d  wright in more recent year the position of bailey boswell and scroggs have come under closer scrutiny perhaps the most critical evaluation of boswell s view be that by david wright in his thorough article wright point out several shortcoming of boswell  s treatment of arsenokoitai he fault boswell for fail to cite or cite inaccurately all the reference to lev 18 22 and 20 13 in the church father such a eusebius the    apostolic constitution    clement of alexandria tertullian and origen 127 28 boswell have not consider seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either it form or it meaning from the leviticus passage 129 this be significant for if the term be so derive it clearly refutes boswell s claim that the first half of the word arseno  denotes not the object but the gender of the second half  koitai the lxx must mean    a male who sleep with a male    make arseno  the object wright also fault boswell  s claim regard linguistic feature of the term include suggest parallel 129 though boswell claim that compound with arseno  employ it objectively and those with arreno  employ it a an adjective wright believe that the difference between the two be merely one of dialectical diversity    no semantic import attache to the difference between the two form    131 wright believe that in most compound in which the second half be a verb or have a verbal force the first half denotes it object and where    the second part be substantival the first half denotes it gender    132 it be with boswell  s treatment of the early church father that wright take special issue because the former have fail to cite all the source for example aristides apology c  ad 138 probably us arrenomaneis androbaten and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality 133 contrary to boswell  s discussion boswell fails to cite hippolytus refut omn haer 5 26 22 23 and improperly cite eusebius and the syriac writer bardensanes the latter us syriac term that be identical to the syriac of i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 133 34 next wright show how the early church father use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria refer to male homosexuality with teenager the dominant form of male homosexuality among the greek 134 sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listing of moicheia    adultery    porneia    fornication    and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replace paidophthoris 136 clement of alexandria in protr 10 108 5 cite the second table of the ten commandment a    you shall not kill ou moicheuseis    you shall not commit adultery    ou paidophthoreseis    you shall not practice homosexuality with boy    you shall not steal    150 n  43 another occurrence of arsenokoitein    commit homosexuality    exists in the sibylline oracle 2 71 73  it may be wright observes that the word be coin by a jewish pre christian writer in a hellenistic set represent by or sib  book 2 137 38 wright also discus us of arsenokoitai in rhetorius 6th c  who drew upon the first century ad writer teucer in macarius 4th 5th c  and in john the faster d  595 139 40 the last in particular bear the idea of homosexual intercourse contrary to boswell wright next reply to boswell  s contention that the term would not be absent    from so much literature about homosexuality if that be what it denote 140 41 wright point out that it should not be expect in writer prior to the first century ad since it do not exist before then that the greek use dozen of word and phrase to refer to homosexuality that some source e g didache show no acquaintance with paul  s letter or deliberately avoid cite scripture and that boswell neglect cite several church father 140 41 boswell  s treatment of chrysostom in particular draw wright  s attention 141 44 boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of chrysostom omit reference and assert what be patently untrue chrysostom give a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on rom 1 26  boswell have exaggerated chrysostom  s infrequent use of the term wright observes that boswell have    signally fail to demonstrate any u of arsenokoites etc in which it patently do not denote male homosexual activity    144 it be infrequent because of it relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term a paidophthoria that more clearly specify the prevail form of male homosexuality in the greco roman world wright also survey the latin syriac and coptic translation of i tim and i cor all three render arsenokoitai with word that reflect the meaning    homosexual    i e  they understand arseno  a the object of the second half of the word 144 45 none of these primary version support boswell  s limited conclusion base on them wright concludes his discussion with a few observation about the catalogue of vice a a literary form he believe that such list developed in late judaism a hellenistic jew write in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the greek world this parallel the increase concern on the part of moral philosopher over homosexual indulgence the term come into be under the influence of the lxx 145 so that writer spoke    generally of male activity with male rather than specifically categorize male sexual engagement with paides    146 if arsenokoitai and paidophthoria be interchangeable it be because the former encompass the latter 146 in summary wright seek to show that arsenokoitai be a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with judaism the view of boswell scroggs and others who limit the term to    active male prostitute    or pederasty be without significant support from linguistic and historical study

 without quote at length from the preceeding post just like to say that i find it a much more appropriate way of deal with issue like the holocaust and bosnia that assert that    god be punish them    the activity of god be always _redemptive_ which mean    restore what have be lose broken or distort    so god do not _will_ the brokenness lostness distortion genocide poverty etc but be nonetheless capable willing and active to restore heal mend and redeeem
 always a two way street god give her the grace to avoid sin thus when she be visit by gabriel she give her fiat her total acceptance of god  s will this fiat summarizes why catholic regard her a the high of all human that god chose her and that she accepted know this in advance we extrapolate that she be neither stain by nor subject to original sin god do create u all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin    sufficient for the day be the evil thereof and the grace of god to command it    this amount of grace be precisely determine by god to be the amount require to do what god ask of her the grace give to each of u be also enough but we do not always choose to accept it we also believe jesus be fully human and never sin god could have create a much well person than myself one who always chose the right thing yet he create me instead despite my flaw he prof he love me a i be continually draw me towards perfection for whatever purpose he have for me he have confidence that i will accomplish it if i ask god to repeat his miraculous creation of the mother of his son where will that leave me
 if you be to start your own religion this would be fine but there be no scriptural basis for your statement in fact it really get to the heart of the problem you think you know more than scripture your faith be driven by feel goodism and not by the word of god just because they be nice people make it right you can start all the church you want and it change the fact that it be wrong that be not to imply that gay deserve the same love and forgiveness that anyone else do but to call their behavior right just because they be nice people be baseless and it offer satan a perfect place to work because there be no check on what he be do
 this have troubled me for a long time and need to be dealt with from a long article available through an individual on this newsgroup about scripture be against homosexuality                                                                when we be less homophobic we will see that what we know a gay and lesbian people engage in love voluntary erotic relation with each other even mention in the bible tk                                                                this frightens me not in the homophobic sense but intellectually especially because it be write by someone from a homosexual church so if my interpretation be different than theirs i be homophobic this be right disagreement in interpretation of the bible and or rejection of homosexual act be not tantamount of homophobia
 i would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven know that even one man would spend his    eternal life    be scorch for his wrongdoing     stephen i suspect that when you and i use the word    hell    we have different concept in mind when you encounter reference to heaven in term of crown and harp and golden street i trust that you do not suppose or suspect christian of suppose that the golden street be to be take literally still less that they be what the concept of heaven be all about why then should you suppose that about the    fire    of hell have you read the novel atlas shrug do you remember the last description of james taggart sit on the floor beside the ferris persuader this come close to a description of what be meant by hell in my circle if the image of fire be often use in this connection there be two reason that occur to me the first reason be that it conveys the idea of hell a something that any rational be would earnestly wish to avoid a any rational be would wish to avoid the fate of james taggart    but the latter image be meaningful only to those who have read atlas shrug a small audience than those who have played with match the second reason be the history of the hebrew word    gehenna    one of the word translate    hell    in the new testament it refers to the valley of hinnon outside jerusalem in early day it be a place where the canaanite offer human sacrifice burn alive to molech later it be make a garbage or refuse dump where fire burn continually consume the trash of the city of jerusalem    to be cast into gehenna    or    to burn in gehenna    thus become a metaphor for    to be reject or discard a worthless    l you think that identify hell with the fate of james taggart be my own private fancy i commend to you the book the great divorce by c s lewis it discus heaven no harp and hell no flame it be shorter than atlas shrug and available at most bookstore and library
 i recall reading somewhere that a number of bishop spent a great deal of time debate the topic of    how many angel could fit on the tip of a needle    do anybody have a reference to this thanks
 note the difference here one be say if  christ  disagrees with a christian be gay  christ  can change that the other be say if  i  think be gay be wrong that a christian can not be gay  i  need to tell them to change a lois say and a before her paul write to the believer in rome who be you to judge another  s servant  jen
 paul  s statement only asserts that that particular choice be not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past just a the fate of the man born blind john 9 be not there be no question here of the simplistic idea of karma a a machine that be the sole determiner of one  s destiny even the eastern tradition or many of them do not say that a one knowledgeable poster point out and if in fact that paul do not know about or believe in reincarnation do not say anything one way or another about it even john the baptist who jesus say emphatically be elijah matt 11 14 do not appear to have be aware of it at least at the point at which he be ask but it be interest that his threefold denial    to the question whether he be the christ the prophet i e isaiah or elijah be emphatic in the first case and very weak in the third i would like to add once again that while it be important to discus the different passage that may point directly to the teach of repeat earth life one way or another what i really see a important in our time be that the subject be revisit in term of the large view of christianity and christian doctrine for the most part those who do accept it either reject the central idea of christianity or if they be christian hold their conviction a a kind of separate treasure i believe that christianity have important new understand to bring to bear on it and vice versa much that be central to christianity take on entirely new dimension of meaning in light of repeat earth life it have a direct bearing on many of the issue frequently discuss in this newsgroup in particular i have say openly that i have developed my view of repeat earth life largely from the work of rudolf steiner not that i hold him a an authority but the whole picture of christianity becomes clearer in light of these idea steiner indicate that the old consciousness of reincar  nation necessarily have to fade away that it could be renew in later time after a time of development of the christ idea through the first two millenia after christ  s deed on golgotha in our own time it becomes important that have receive the basic gospel of salvation our understand of life and of the human be can now grow to embrace the significance of this idea for the discussion in this newsgroup i have try to focus on that which can be related a directly a possible to scripture and to fundamental christian teach and tradition
 to the moderator i post this about a week ago but it never show up locally on the net if this have already actually be post please fill free to flush this copy    n from db7n  andrew cmu edu d  andrew byler 1 a english translation of this can be found in    the act of the apostle translate from the codex bezae with an introduction on it lucan origin and importance    j  m  wilson london 1923 2 another work that might be useful be    the act of the apostle a critical edition with introduction and note on select passage    albert c  clark oxford 1933 reprint 1970 this be an edition of text of act that make the assumption that the text in codex bezae be the more authentic i know if it actually contains an english translation or not 3 another useful that discus many of the variant in detail be    the theological tendency of the codex bezae cantabrigiensis in act    eldon j epp cambridge 1966 4 the most recent reference i found be an edition in french from the early  80s i can supply the reference if anyone  s interested 5 now many of the work be go to be difficult to find so if interested in examine the difference in the long recension an excellent and easily obtainable discussion can be found in    a textual commentary on the greek nt    bruce metzger united bible society 1971 metzger  s book serf a a companion volume to the ubs 3rd edition of the greek nt it contains a discussion on the reason that go behind the decision on each of the 1440 variant reading include in the ubs3 furthermore note on an addition 600 reading be include in atcotgnt the majority of these occur in act    an attempt be make to set before the reader a more or less full report with an english translation of the several addition and other modification that be attest by western witness     since many of these have no correspond apparatus in the text volume care be take to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that support the divergent reading    p 272 6 most of the copy of the text of act that we have include the one in vaticanus and siniaticus adher pretty closely to the shorter or alexandrian version the longer version to which you refer be usually call the    western    version and it main witness be the codex bezae althought there be a few other rather fragmentary source 7 a far a size the difference be that in clark  s edition mention above the book of act contains 19 983 word whereas the text edit by westcott and hort a typical alexandrian text contains 18 401 word i e a difference of about 8 1 2 8 to answer the obvious question no there be no major revelation in the longer text nor major omission in the shorter text the main difference seem to    expansion    of detail in the western text or if you prefer    contraction    in the alexandrian the western text seem to be give to more detail there be some interest specific case but this probably not the place to go into it in detail 9 the discussion over the year a to which of these version be the more authentic have be hot and heavy if there be anything approach a modern consensus it be i that neither text represent purely the    authentic    version ii each variant reading have to be examine on it own merit however iii the variant in the alexandrian text be the    well    more often than not
 this be not at all comparable christianity be the main stream in western culture you be trivialize the experience of others i remember what it be like be    different    a a christian we be told all the time that we be different and in fact that only member of the our church be really christian though others who believe in god a bad a atheist so we be a small minority that be nothing compare to be an atheist the only thing comparable would be a young child be christian be surround by staunch atheist include parent who actively persecute any religious tendancies both actual punishment and even bad emotional blackmail they would also have to have the whole mainstream society on their side maybe these condition could have occur in the old soviet union  not in a country with    under god    in it pledge of allegiance i doubt it even then because child have to be taught to be christian and hence must have support somewhere yes my atheism be    born of necessity    for an intellectually honest person belief be mostly a response to evidence will or wish have nothing to do with it i could choose to lie or to be silent about my true belief i could no more choose to believe in the god of christianity than i could decide that the ordinary sky look red to me still i should be clear that not equate what i go through with what gay go through however it be a mistake to assume that everyone who go through painful experience be broken by them happily some be make strong once we get past it not without go to detail and violate the confidence of some of my childhood friend suffice it say to that religion do not guarantee that a person will be happy and strong emotionally and a repressive upbringing can leave it scar even or especially on those who get free of it i doubt that any sane and sincere person doubt that and i feel no need to defend it by the way i be much happier and strong be out of the closet in the end it have be a someone eloquently put it in private email an experience of liberation rather than disillusion

virility in their mind god be the young bull who have impale pharaoh on his horn and gore egypt  s god a he lead israel to sinai but when man worship a god of power his miracle grow thin and even boring after miracle food on the desert floor and water gush miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland the god of almightiness becomes    ho hum    what s next on the miracle menu    and a god of power can be a unpredictable a a young bull calf he might be all they need but then     who know if he have all power he have a right to do whatever he want whenever he want the only person these people have know who have absolute power be pharaoh and men  s life have hung on the whim of his mood which could change with the wind they believe god could work his wonder on their behalf but they do not know him and so could not trust him israel have a god base on what he do his act moses knew the heart of god the motivation behind the act from the day of his encounter at the burning bush moses have be fascinate by god at sinai he ask to be show his glory     to know who he really be he have see what god have do he want to know who god be this request be grant and moses be give a glimpse of god  s glorious person he have come to know the heart of god a compassion and lovingkindness exodus 34 6 7 the word    lovingkindness    be not to be understood a a human kind of love it speaks of the kind of relationship arise out of the make of a covenant it can only be understood a the love that say    i will never leave you nor forsake you    lovingkindness be a tenacious a a british bulldog when the world walk out this love dig in it heel and refuse to leave and it be not human romantic love base on feeling and root in emotion it be a love of covenant commitment and therefore operates quite apart from feeling god  s love be not an emotion that waver day by day it be the total commitment of his be to seek our high and best and to bring u to our full potential a human god do not see something good and beautiful in u which arouses his feeling of love toward u     we do not woo him and cause him to fall in love with u if that be the case the first ugly sinful thing we do would cause him to reject u he be love and he love u because of who he be    not because of who we be he do not love what we do but he be commit to u pursue u down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness he will not let u go his be a love that be not look for what it can get out of u    but a commit love that search for opportunity to give to u it be say to the recipient    for a long a we shall live i be for you    the god who have reveal himself to man through scripture and finally in jesus    in his come and in his death and resurrection    be the god who be lovingkindness thus he love u and give himself to u     he will never leave u nor forsake u tragically many believer have never see him a love they see him a power no one will come to faith by just see miracle miracle point to who he be and that be when faith spring in the heart israel do not see god a lovingkindness they saw his act of power moses knew his way the kind of god he be and the love that he have for these people because of their total lack of understand of his love they could not trust him to be their strength in take the land faith be born out of know the love he have for u it be the rest response to the one who give himself to u he be not the force and to call him the almighty be to miss his heart he be love who be the almighty and the infinite force if man be to make force or raw power work for him he must depend on know the forrnula and have faith in it but the power that issue from love demand faith in the person of love himself the forty year of meaningless wander be a monument to a people who have never come to know the god of love at this point with the new generation and the possibility of enjoy all that god promise moses prays verse 14  the language moses us be reminiscent of a baby have slept secure in it mother  s love now wake to look up into the delight of her eye it be wake to the consciousness of be love     watch over care for protect fed and clean day and night by the mother suppose we be to ask    what have the baby do to deserve this    or    have arrangement be make for the child to repay the parent for this inconvenience    our question would be consider unnatural even immoral the child be conceive in love anticipate and prepared for with love  s excitement a love that have be to the gate of death to bring it into be the parent love be unconditional spontaneous     it have nothing to do with the look of the child or it performance so god be love he love u unconditionally spontaneously we be conceive in his imagination and fashion after his image to be brought to where we be at this moment by the blood of the lord jesus it be slanderous and immoral to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love the child discovers it personhood and identity through the eye and touch through the cuddle of it parent love it be a scientific fact that a baby who be not touch and held will probably die or if it survives will have severe emotional problem and a person who have be held and love will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from god moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning rest with total confidence in the love of god and will receive all his promise and blessing with joy and gladness significantly moses prays that they will be satisfied with his love    satisfied    in the hebrew language be a rich picture word describe be fill with an abundance of gourmet food it be also use to describe the earth after the rain have soak it and all the vegetation have receive enough water moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drench in the life giving love of god that sense of satisfaction be the lifelong quest of every man and woman when we be satisfied in our deepest self many of our emotional    and even our physical    problem disappear man seek that sense of satisfaction which come from feel that he be fulfil a a human be     his hour have meaning which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane apart from god man seek this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit through the excite of the emotion and through the feed of his body     he will even seek it in religious exercise but man will always be dissatisfied until he be respond to the love of the living god only in know god  s love will the rest of life make sense a the forty year drew to a close and the land of promise again become the inheritance to be take moses prayed this psalm i find it fascinate that he should pray and ask god for a daily revelation of his love consider the awe with which the people held moses one would think he could have lecture them on the subject of lovingkindness and by the knowledge they gain they would live in it but moses knew well god be the only one who can make know to u his love we find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate him nor be it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotion and give u god feeling it be god himself the lover who must open our eye and satisfy u with his love this prayer be man in helplessness ask god to make the love he be real in our heart moses prayer be partially answer in the next generation and see in the exploit of faith which work by love in the book of judge but it would not be answer in it full dimension until the come of the holy spirit who pours out the love of god in our heart roman 5 5 in the history of the early church we read of the holy spirit    fall upon    the believer this be an ancient expression that in modern english mean to give a bear hug it be use in luke 15 to describe the father run to the prodigal and    fall on his neck and kiss him    the holy spirit be god hug you in your deepest self and smother you with divine kiss at the deepest level of your be this be not a one time experience to be file in our spiritual resume moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we be love the world and much of our religious training have taught u to perform in order to be accepted we have spent far too long living in a state of do in order to find satisfaction for ourselves     to find acceptance and love from others and from god we now come humble to receive love we can not earn     to be still and let him tell u we be love to let the holy spirit descend into u pour out the love of god we come in stillness to think on and repeat his word of love to our mind which have be jade with the doctrine of    perform to be accepted    we begin to realize that he love u a we be and give meaning and purpose to all of life i challenge everyone reading this to begin each day from the moment you open your eye by celebrate the god of love and pray this prayer you may not feel anything but something always happens i be x rayed the other day i do not see or feel anything but i note that the technician kept behind protective wall they know you can not be expose to those ray without be affected so it be a we consciously begin our day know that we be love such experiential knowledge will produce accord to moses    joy and gladness all our day    joy be the result of a life that be function a god intend u to function when he make u you might say that joy be the hum of an engine that be at peak performance man s high performance be to rest in the love god have for him     the hum will be joy and the result will be endless creativity arise from the sense of meaning he now have in life stop wander in the wilderness be satisfied with his love and in joy day by day receive all his promise blessing

 refer to mary i have quite a problem with the idea that mary never commit a sin be mary fully human if it be possible for god to miraculously make a person free of original sin and free of commit sin their whole life then what be the purpose of the incarnation of jesus why god just repeat the miracle do for mary to make all the rest of u sinless without the need for repentance and salvation and all that i particularly object to the idea of the assumption or the perpetual virginity both of which i regard a catholic dogma about which i will agree to disagree with my catholic brother and sister in christ and i even believe in the virgin birth of jesus but this concept of mary  s sinlessness seem to me to be at odds with the rest of christian doctrine a i understand it

 aaron colossian 2 11 12    in him you be also circumcise in the aaron put off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision do aaron by christ have be bury with him in baptism and raise aaron with him through your faith in the power of god who raise him aaron from the dead    aaron in baptism we be raise to a new life in christ roman 6 4 aaron through a personal faith in the power of god our parent s aaron faith can not do this do infant have faith let  s look at aaron what the bible have to say about it yes let do try    and if anyone cause one of these little one  who believe in me  to sin it would be well for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tie around his neck    mark 9 42    let the little child come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such a these i tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it    the colossian passage do not make faith a requirement for baptism it merely say that in baptism we be born again regenerate and resurrect through faith in the case of an infant i would say that baptism work faith in the heart of the infant    through the power of the word the colossian passage do make baptism a spiritual circumcision circumcision be the mean by which a male infant be make a part of god  s covenant with israel it be command to be perform on the eighth day the early church understood this and even debate whether baptism have to be perform on the eighth day or if it could in fact be do earlier aaron roman 10 16 17    but not all the israelite accepted the good aaron news for isaiah say  lord who have believe our message aaron consequently faith come from hearing the message and the aaron message be heard through the word of christ    aaron so then we receive god  s gift of faith to u a we hear the aaron message of the gospel and the gospel be surely preach at any infant  s or adult  s baptism indeed in a very real sense the sacrament be the gospel make tangible aaron faith be a possible response to hearing aaron god  s word preach kid be not yet spiritually aaron intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to aaron god  s word how do you know they be not yet mature enough to have faith do you know this on the basis of god  s word or from your own reason faith be also described a a gift from god ephesian 2 8 9  he give faith to infant just a he give it to adult through the power of the gospel roman 1 6  aaron if you read all of ezekiel 18 you will see that god aaron hold u guilty for anyone else  s sin so we can have no aaron original guilt from adam here you show that you just understand original sin    you be argue against a straw man maybe be talk to catholic too much i know but original sin do not consist of god  s imputation of adam  s guilt to u it consists of our inheritance of adam  s sinful nature it be actual sin see for example the augsburg confession article ii and the apology of the augsburg confession article ii and for extra credit john knox  s the scot confession article iii aaron now then that we have a little more background a to why aaron original sin be not biblical let  s look at some of the aaron scripture use to support it aaron roman 5 12    therefore just a sin enter the world through aaron one man and death through sin and in this way death come to aaron all men because all sin       ask yourself this question    do infant ever die    then ask yourself    if infant baptism be not valid then where be the christian church during all the century when almost all of the baptism be perform on infant be luther melancthon calvin zwingli hus knox andrae and chemnitz christian aaron psalm 51 5    surely i be sinful at birth sinful from the time aaron my mother conceive me    aaron this whole psalm be a wonderful example of how we should humble aaron ourselves before god in repentance for sin david himself aaron be a man after god  s own heart and write the psalm after aaron commit adultry with bathsheba and murder her husband aaron all that david be say here be that he remember a time aaron when he sinful he be humble himself before god by aaron confess his sinfulness his say that he be sinful at aaron birth be a hyperbole the bible be inspire by god aaron limited to a literal interpetation but also us figure of aaron speech a do jesus john 16 25 for another example of aaron hyperbole see luke 14 26  who be you to say what be literal and what be not be a literal interpretation manifestly absurd in psalm 51 by reason of direct contradiction with a clear passage from the word of god you might also compare genesis 8 21    the lord smell the please aroma and say in his heart never again will i curse the ground because of man even though every inclination of his heart be evil from childhood        aaron we see aaron that he do grow and become wiser in luke 2 40 and 2 52  the aaron implication be that jesus do wrong thing a a child before he aaron knew to choose right over wrong you be a long way from prove this rather monstrous assertion all you can say be that jesus grow in wisdom and in stature a conclusion that he do wrong a a child be base on an extrapolation of reason not on a direct revelation in scripture

 when elizabeth greet mary with the word    bless art thou among woman    luke 1 42 it appear that this place mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity but deborah say judge 5 24 bless among woman shall be jael the wife of heber the kenite bless above all woman in the tent it can doubtless be take that jael  s slay of sisera be a type of mary  s victory over sin but even if we take deborah  s word a apply prophetically or symbolically to mary they must still be applicable literally to jael we may well take them to mean that god use her a a part of his plan for the deliverance of his people and that she have this in common with mary but we have no reason to suppose that they mean that she be sinless and thus no reason to take the like expression apply to mary a proof that she be sinless
         i can think of another alternative 4 oobe  s be a form of contact with the demonic world whereby one intentionally or unintentionally surrender control of his or her perception to spiritual being whose purpose be to deceive and entrap them
 in some earlier discussion on this thread i may have give the impression that even though child require baptism it hurt if they be to the contrary when you baptize child before they be capable of comprehend it you deny them their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to serve god have any of you consider that child be not accountable for sin because they be not capable of repentance peter say to a group of    men and brother       repent and be baptize every one of you    act 2 38 notice that he specify that if they  repent  then they may be  baptized  in follow peter  s instruction people must first demonstrate repentance a forsake of their sin and a desire to obey god  s command  before  they be eligible to be baptize since young child be not capable of repent they be not eligible for baptism and since god be both just and merciful    sin be not impute when there be no law    roman 5 13 young child be not accountable for what they comprehend
 the cite passage be cover in depth in a faq for this group that particular faq forgotten the author discus the traditional vs  pro homosexual interpretation of the passage and indicates which point have strong textual support perhaps the moderator might give again the instruction for retrieve the faq on this topic btw this issue while dealt with before be very timely one of the major presbyterian church in california st  andrew    a megachurch in a rich neighborhood be withholding their support of synod amount to about 10 of the budget of the synod which cover all of southern ca and hawaii until support for a pro homosexual lobbying group the lazarus project be terminate this come from a news report on cnn yesterday    correction welcome tim i think time for me to post the faq this be an issue throughout the presbyterian church on the other side one of the major church in cincinnati have be ordain homosexual elder and have ignore presbytery instruction not to do so and the church in rochester where the judicial commission say they install a homosexual pastor have make her an    evangelist    these situation a well a the one you describe do not appear to be stable this will certainly be a major topic for the general assembly next month if the church come up with a solution that will let people live with each other i think end up with a split clearly neither side want that but i think get push into it by action of both side
 interest question esp since i remember  wishing  with all my heart that this  were  true so that i have to be a    good christian    anymore    christianity    be terribly hard the only reward be heaven and maybe sometimes if i be really good acceptance i want a way out what jesus have do for me since i found him some 6 month ago i do not want to lose period that say i originally interpret the what if a    if christ never mention sheol and weep and gnash of teeth if christ preach that those who do not follow him die and stayed dead and at that point forever cease to exist        i believe that we can only be complete through christ do you think that buddhist can also be complete  jen
 jung may have say that but he be in no way speak for the catholic church the dogma of the assumption in no way mean mary be consider to be god or part of    the godhead    therefore it implies no such thing about the feminine in general also jung  s statement make it sound a though the dogma be announce    out of the blue    this also be incorrect a dogma be only the formulation of what have always be part of tradition this dogma have always be believe but be not formally define until the assumption be declare a an _ex cathedra_ statement
 before you finalize your file in the faq or after you might want to correct the typo in the follow it seem one or the other end of the rating scale should be identify with    homosexual    a a personal note i guess i differ with you on the question of work enter human life a a result of sin before the fall gen 2 15    and the lord god take the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it    which i would call    work    for me the difference introduce by sin be the painful aspect of work add at the fall i take the curse of the ground in vs 17 19 to apply to the work for sustenance in a way some view    work    a a blessing ecclesiastes be a fun book for melancholy i hope i do not sound caustic maybe you can enlighten me far well this be certainly a delicate subject and i guess you accomplish what you state a your purpose    it summarizes argument for allow christian homosexuality    not for me the most noble goal but you be write a faq i wonder if you might temporize the apparent    sentence    of the specific homosexual you propose arguably tenuously define perhaps that would be true of    celibacy from homosexual relation    or refrainng from their choice relationship but that do not forbid heterosexual could they not have enjoy heterosexual relation    for what it be worth
 you be right michael in john 3 5 jesus say    amen amen i say to you no one can enter the kingdom of god without be born of water and spirit    really what he say and he meant it that verse be the definition of baptism i have the law book in front of me but there be a canon law that urge parent to baptize their child within one week of birth for the very reason that you state

 the last time we discuss homosexuality i ask whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the bible prohibit but which might in some circumstance bring no apparent harm to anyone put another way the question be whether homosexual intercourse be the only act that christian be suppose to believe be immoral solely on the basis that god say it be with no insight be offer a to  why  it be immoral no one could answer my question in either form from the bible i do get an interest response base on roman catholic theology however i think now that i can at least answer my first question link hudson point me to it in his recent comment about sleep with one  s aunt incest be held to be immoral in every society that be there be some degree of relationship where marriage and thus intercouse be prohibit the bible be no exception the trouble be that it may be difficult to see  why  a particular relationship qualifies a incestuous society differ a to how they define incest genetic reason be sometimes offer but all the biblical case can not be dealt with that way why a man sleep with his step mother    assume that his father be dead and that he have    married    her how do this case differ from the  duty  to marry one  s brother  s childless wife be these two case parallel do the bible prohibit some incestuous marriage and homosexual marriage for the same reason perhaps that god know they be not good for u and yet we be incapable of understand why p s please bother write me to tell me that i be a homophobe a some do last time my mind be not make up on these question you know whether i be homophobic or not you know me to call me or anyone else a homophobe without know the person may be a much an expression of bigotry a some homophobic remark

 michael the kind of interpretation i see a    incredibly perverse    be michael that apply to the story of sodom a if it be a blanket michael equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christian michael cite the bible in such a context should be presume to have michael at least read the story it amount to slander    a charge michael that homosexuality    rape    to use that against u and michael it be just michael a wrong though slightly less incendiary so a michael secondary argument from the  phobic contingent to equate michael homosexuality with such behavior a to equate it with the michael rape of god  s messenger let  s review the sodom and gomorrah story briefly it state clearly that the visitor be angel but    all the men from every part of the city of sodom    both young and old    surround the house they call to lot where be the  men  who come to you tonight bring them out to u so that we can have sex with them    for the rest of the story the angel be refer to by the men of sodom and by lot a  men  furthermore we know from gen 18 20 21 that the lord have already found sodom guilty of grievous sin    before the angel visit the city it be clear that the grievous sin of sodom and gomorrah involve homosexual sex it appear that the men have become so inflame in their lust that they have group orgy in the public square    which simply indicates the extremity of their depravity it do not show that lesser degree of homosexuality be not sinful a michael would have u believe ultimately our understand of god  s will for sexuality come from the creation story    not solely on the story of sodom and gomorrah he create u male and female and institute marriage a a relationship between one male and one female    therefore a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife and they will become one flesh    this marriage relationship be the only sexual relationship which god blesses and sanction he regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman and even us it a a picture of the relationship between himself and his church but we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men or between two woman everything else that we find in the bible about sexuality derives from or express god  s will in institute and blessing marriage thus the levitical code which be give only to the jew forbade incest homosexuality bestiality the ten commandment forbade adultery and the covet of our neighbor  s wife other commandment forbade rape the men of sodom and gomorrah be regard a sexually immoral and perverse jude 7 because they abandon and or pollute the marriage relationship thus also paul regard homosexuality a unnatural roman 1 26 27    not because this be simply paul  s opinion but because it be contrary to god  s purpose in create u male and female michael christian no doubt very sincere one keep show up here michael and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they michael ever do be spout these same old verse which they obviously michael have never thought about maybe never even read in total michael ignorance of the issue raise slander u with the vilest michael charge of child abuse or whatever their perfervid mind can michael manage to conjure up toss out red herring with they michael suppose great emotional force to cause reader to dismiss michael our witness without even take the trouble to find out what michael it be really have you no well response to slander than more slander

 i write that i thought that 2 peter 1 20 meant    no prophecy of scripture or a one reader suggests no write prophecy be merely the private opinion of the writer    tony zamora reply sat 8 may 1993 that this in turn implies that it be not subject to the private interpretation of the reader either i be not sure that i understand this in one sense no statement by another be subject to my private interpretation if reliable historian tell me that the athenian lose the pelopennesian war i can not simply interpret this away because i want the athenian to win fact be fact and do not go away because i want them to be otherwise in another sense every statement be subject to private interpretation in that i have to depend on my brain and expereience to decide what it mean and whether it be sufficiently well attest to merit my assent even if the statement occurs in an inspire write i still have to decide use my own best judgement whether it be in fact inspire this be not arrogance    it be just an inescapable fact
    hate the sin but love the sinner        heard that quite a bit recently     my question be whether that statement be consistent with christianity i would think not hate begets more hate never love     in the summary of the law christ command u to love god and to love our neighbor he say anything about hate in fact if anything he command u to save our criticism for ourselves     scott i too dislike the phrase    hate the sin love the sinner    maybe the definite article be also part of the problem since it seem to give u license to fixate on our brother  s peculiar pecadillo which we have manage to escape by a common grace of heredity economic situation or culture our outrage at evil be too often just a cheap shot that say i think scott have adequately explore the flip side of this coin namely the love of righteousness in the beatitude jesus bless those who hunger and thirst for righteousness in the new testament it be never enough just to behave well one should always actively desire and work for the cause of good in that sense it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and it victim even when these be it accomplice a well maybe    mourn sin love sinner    catch the idea slightly well than    hate    but only slightly since grief usually implies a passive powerless position a balance christian response need grief love and carefully measure constructive anger jesus have all three the european pietists during wwii whose response to nazi atrocity be devoid of anger do not fare well a role model however much love or grief they exemplify my sister be an actress in new york and a christian a few year back jack her long time professional friend and benefactor die of aid impoverish by medical bill estrange from his family and abandon by most of his survive friend only my sister and brother in law be there with him at the very end in her grief over jack  s death my sister found quite a few target for anger callous bureaucracy the rigid self protective moralism of jack  s family the inertia in christian response to aid and yes even jack  s own lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life jack himself share that last anger brought up with strong christian value he be contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before his aid appear i imply no moral judgement here about jack s innate sexual orientation n b maybe the hardest job be make our anger constructive
 yes there be these two sens of interpretation and certainly our decision to accept scripture a inspire ultimately rest on our own private opinion however when reading scripture we have to remember that the scripture be give by god for our instruction and that the interpretation that matter be the one god intend for example if i decide that the fact that john the baptist be elijah teach the doctrine of reincarnation i be wrong because that be not the intend interpretation the prophet make up this teach it come from god and we must accept it a such this necessarily mean that our private interpretation must take a back seat to the meaning god intend to convey certainly we must rely on our best effort to determine what this meaning be but this very fact should make u recognize that our private interpretation can not be automatically accepted a the infallible interpretation of god we need to test the spirit to see if they be from god when the holy spirit speaks he say the same thing to all he tell me that a passage mean one thing and tell you it mean another if the two of u come to conflict conclusion we both be completely right we know our interpretation be reliable only when the church a a whole agrees on what scripture mean this be how we know the doctrine of the trinity the dual nature of christ etc infallibly these matter be not up for private interpretation this be the reason peter go on to talk about the deceptiveness of the false teacher they prefer their own private interpretation to the god given teach of the apostle it be through such private interpretation that the tradition of men so soundly denounce in scripture be start
 well here be something i write some time ago in response to a similar question i hope it help begin repeat of previous post a for the scripture mention i agree that it do seem to be a problem not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general luke  s version have jesus say that the child of this world marry and be give in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven it almost sound like marriage disqualifies one for salvation matthew and mark both omit this statement i think the account be not a clear a they might be let  s have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable idea of what it mean the scripture involve be mat 22 23 30 mark 12 18 25 and luke 20 27 36  what happen be that the sadducee who do not believe in the resurrection thought they could trap jesus they make reference to the    leverite    marriage which require the brother of a man who die without child to take the widow to wife and raise up child the child would be consider child of the decease just a though the woman  s first husband have father them it seem obvious from this that the woman be still consider in a way to be the wife of her first husband however the sadducee concoct a scene in which 6 brother of the decease each in his turn fail to father child by the widow they seem to imply that the leverite marriage be equal to the first for they ask    whose wife shall she be in the resurrection    at this point it seem obvious that if she be anybody  s wife it be the first husband after all have she borne child they would have be credit to him regardless of which brother be the biological father it be possible jesus be refer to this when he say    ye do err not know the scripture or the power of god    mat 22 29 compare mark 12 24 phrase not in luke  s account anyway the sadducee ask    whose wife will she be in the resurrection see that all 7 have her    jesus answer be that    in the resurrection they neither marry nor be give in marriage        mat 22 30    when they rise from the dead they neither marry        mark 12 25    they which be account worthy to obtain that world neither marry        luke 20 35 all 3 account go on to say    but be a the angel in heaven    or the equivalent i find this last not very helpful since the bible do not define angel nor give any idea what their life be like some minister claim that they be sexless different that human etc but i can find no biblical support for this
 in the monday may 10 morning edition of the san jose mercury news an article by sandra gonzales at the top of page 12a explain convict killer david edwin mason  s troubled childhood say    raise in oakland and san lorenzo by strict fundamentalist christian parent mason be beaten a a child he once be tie to a workbench and gag with a cloth after he accidently urinated on his mother when she walk under his bedroom window court record show    be the san jose mercury news to come out with an article start with    raise in oakland by mexican parent mason be beaten        my face would be red with anger over the injustice do to my mexican family member and the mexican community a a whole sure sandra gonzales would be equally upset why be it that open biggotry like this be practice and encourage by the san jose mercury news when it be point at the christian community can a good christian continue to purchase newspaper and buy advertising in this kind of a newspaper this be really bad journalism

 public revelation which be the basis of catholic doctrine end with the death of st john the last apostle nothing new can be add every so often the pope declares that some depart christian be now in heaven and may be invoked in the public rite of the church it be my understand that roman catholic believe that such declaration by the pope be infallible i see three possibility 1 the church have receive a public revelation since the death of for example joan of arc 2 the church be give a list before the death of st john which have joan  s name on it 3 there be no public revelation about joan and roman catholic be free to doubt that she die in a state of grace or even that she be a historical character
 several reply to my post have say that i should get to know christian homosexual before judging them i maintain that i be not judging them by say that homosexuality be wrong i would like to look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical evaluation of the people who respond to the side of christianity and homosexuality be compatible admitedly not all be homosexual but i know that many be from their e mail responces i normally make sterotypical assumption about group of people but since i have be ask to by many of the oppose veiw point i will so far people have make wild assumption put me down because i have the resource of others and even revert to name call if you think this be an acurate representation then those of you who be homosexual christian show me the diffrence
 okay i go back and look sure enough my hunch be right 2 peter be most likely write between 100 120 a d  revelation be almost certainly write between 80 96 a d  odds be the gospel of john be write around 90 a d  best date for luke and act be around 80 a d  maybe later again this be from footnote information in the new american bible the best translation come across in regard to give complete historical information about each book mike
 perhaps one other thing i should have add be that jeremiah  s prophesies about the come destruction of jerusalem would have be understood by the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understand of their relationship with the lord today the if the general populace hears    prophesies    like the portland earthquake or new york will burn one they be unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship or lack of it with the lord they be far more likely to think that they be just the result of the fevered imagination of a religious nutter that be one reason why i be always deep y suspicious of bald judgement prophesies without any explanation of the reason for the judgement this have to be long wind to see a relatively modern example look at abraham lincoln  s second inaugural speech the relevant section be below it be this type of spiritual insight which be miss in both prophesies post here    excerpt from abraham lincoln  s 2nd inaugural speech       both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god  s assistance in wring their bread from the sweat of other men  s face but let u judge not that we be not judged the prayer of both could not he answer that of neither have be answer fully the almighty have his own purpose   woe unto the world because of offence for it must need be that offence come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh    if we shall suppose that american slavery be one of those offence which in the provdence of god must need come but which have continued through his appoint time he now will to remove and that he give to both north and south this terrible war a the woe due to those by whom the offence come shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believer in a living god always ascribe to him fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pas away yet if god will that it continue until all the wealth pile by the bond man  s two hundred and fifty year of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword a be say three thousand year ago so still it must be say    the judgment of the lord be true and righteous altogether    with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right a god give u to see the right let u strive on to finish the work we be in to bind up the nation  s wound to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a last peace among ourselves and with all nation    ___ bill rea o o                                                                                                     w    u    w
 the basic definition that i use be the belief that jesus be god incarnate the belief that jesus be crucify and raise from the dead for our salvation the acceptance of jesus a personal lord and savior this would include most christian denomination but exclude the unitarian
 though this will be address in the series of article post now under    aresnokoitia    i wait this just really blew my sock off read i tim 1 3 11  verse 3 8 speaks against those who have pervert the teaching of the mosaic law in vv 9 10 we have  in order  the 5th thru the 9th commandment and in the midst of this listing be    homosexual    the decalogue above everything else be see a god  s absolute if you believe in absolute then you have nothing do do with jehovah of the ot which paul reveals to be the messiah of the nt    lord christ jesus    transliterates to read    jehovah  s anoint savior    in i cor5 we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentile a we do in lev 18 20  in i cor 6 9 10 only one notation drunkard be not found in lev 18 20  paul be not naive in his use of the lxx he knew full well how he be use the law of god that be give in the ot for application in the nt a say the law be fulfil not do away with this understand be thoroughly rebut in deyoungs article that be be post please refer to it we can do well than    probably    which be not an adequate defense against the statement that paul  s culture have the same understand of homosexuality a ours again read the article because it us fact i think i do because i have work in the homosexual community by mean of work with aid patient the pastoral be merely the practical application of the theological truth however those who be work thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understand just a with a friend who be contiplating cheat on his wife or a friend who life with his girlfriend yet you continue to witness to him but once the choice be make and there be no remorse then i feel that paul  s    pastoral    care a present in the corinthian church come to bear significance the one in active rebellion should be place outside of the church if a believer and if a non believer then one wipe his sandels and leaf it in god hand if there be a member in your youth group who be constantly paw at the little girl you hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly that in part betrays the present    political correctness    of the issue pederasty be not accepted at the present but some how we be to accept homosexuality because the latter be politically correct while the former be not  at least not yet this be how the moral decay i guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics the liberal want to tax the rich in the federal yet in their own state when they try to get business to settle there they give tax incentive to these same richies it come down to a moral code of relativeness or to use the cultural thing politically correct  at the moment    rex
 this neatly eliminates the need for a savior and    prof    that we can be save by work alone if we have no original sin then it be possible for u to save ourselves by not sin i understand the reason behind your argument but it lead to sheer folly original sin be the reason we need faith to be save
 this be something always found a little curious never quite understood the trinity thing on the one hand jesus be suppose to be god incarnate but at the same time he be god  s son    for god so love the world that he give his only begotten son    first question be if jesus be god in human form how could he really be god  s son if the holy ghost    plant the seed    in mary so to speak then it seem that jesus relationship to god would be the equivalent to the human father son relationship while a son might inherit alot of the father  s quality he be not the father they be still two separite entity to try and say that a son be the same person a the father be obviously wrong in that case jesus and god the same on the other hand if their relationship the same a the human father son relationship but jesus be actually god incarnate then not really god  s son and he never be just god manifest himself a jesus at least this be how see it can someone who be more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten u get back to the original question what be the great price that jesus paid to redeem our sin be it die on the cross since jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 day and then ascend back to heaven i have a hard time see how this be consider pay such a great price for humanity his earthly body may have be kill but then so what he suffer a few hour of physical pain but then there have be many a human who have suffer a great deal more the fact that jesus be god  s only begotten son seem to me to have much meaning since god can beget a many son a he want to jesus be the only one be simply a matter of choice i suspect that these question will be very offensive to many christian on this net to those people please accept my sincere apology it be not my intention to offend or to trivialize christ but i do believe these be legitimate question and i be genuinely curious note that the trinity and incarnation have to be look at together first your reading of the virgin birth be an uncommon one in this group dangerous to say that no one believe something you seem to be suggest the jesus be god  s son in a physical sense with the holy spirit a father and mary a mother i consider that terrible heresy though some people react less violently the virgin birth say that jesus birth be god  s responsibility but it imply that god  s sperm be involve indeed one though by no mean the only speculation be that god use joseph  s genetic material second jesus be in some sense doubly indirect from the father in a trinitarian context the term son refers to the eternal logo who be a part of god the son come into existence with jesus birth jesus be the incarnation of the son so his sonness specifically a result of be incarnate rather the son who be incarnate
 i presume you be quote john 3 3 7 1  my king james bible say    except a man be born of water and of the spirit he can not enter into the kingdom of god    john 3 5 here    man          adult    however this could be a quibble between translation 2  we can also analyze to whom the lord be address    marvel not that i say unto thee ye must be born again    john 3 7 here jesus be clearly direct his remark to nicodemus    a ruler of the jew not a child 3  we can ask ourselves why the lord would even introduce the concept of spiritual re birth through baptism if newborn baby free from sin a idler

 i have no problem with the idea that catechumen be dismiss before the eucharist they be not consider qualify to participate do the dismissal in the early church mean that the eucharist be a secret i mean be it you have to stay from now on only the membership can participate you really have to hang around yes i know oblige to keep up attendance to qualify but now be an exception okay or be it you may not stay what happens next be secret when we have have reason to conduct business meeting after church make it clear that only member can vote but always be happy for non members to stay and observe do you have evidence for intentional secrecy other than rumour which will always happen when you have an underclass do thing not approve of by those in power
 i heard on the radio today about a christian student conference where christian be call to    repent    of america  s    national    sin such a sexual promiscuity to which i reply     whoa there how can i repent of _someone else s_ sin i and when i claim to    repent    of someone else  s sin be i not in fact _judging_ him jesus equip u to judge activity but warn u not to judge people    judge not that ye be not judged    c  s  lewis make the same point in an essay after world war ii when some christian leader in britain be urge    national repentance    for the horror sin of world war ii    i see your point but i can not more strongly disagree to repent mean to turn around we a a nation have behave incredibly arrogantly toward god condone encourage and even force folk to participate in activity directly oppose to the write word of god we have arrogantly set our nation far above the god who create it and allow u the luxury of living in this land we have set a bad example for other nation slaughter unborn child by the million we have stricken the name of god from the classroom cheat god out of the honor due him at every turn and we owe god an apology every bit a public a our sin have be when jesus say    judge not that ye be not judged    he be not address those like john the baptist who have repent and be call others to repent he be address those who remain in sin while heap down condemnation on others for their sin his message to u all be to remove the log from our own eye before remove the speck from our brother  s but he also say to rebuke and to reprove forget that this be a command too our problem today be that we tend to judge and condemn a though we be rebuke and we tend to neglect bring folk back to the lord with the excuse that we want to judge anyone in truth what we need to do be to judge less and call others to repent more and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motif call sin what it be and do so openly let charge fall correctly where it should but instead of run someone into hell over it pull them out of their hellward path and onto the heavenward path                                                                                                                i deplore the horrible crime of child murder     we want prevention not merely punishment we must reach the root of the evil     it be practice by those whose inmost soul revolt from the dreadful deed     no mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffer the unborn innocent the woman be awfully guilty who commits the deed     but oh thrice guilty be he who drove her to the desperation which impel her to the crime
 i agree but i can only speak for myself i have a good friend whose lifestyle be very sinful do i hate the thing she do to herself and others yes do i hate her absolutely not in fact she tell me repeatedly that i be the best friend she have in the world i care about her very much despite the fact that i hate how she life her life very easy to fall into the progression you describe above felt it with my friend more than once there be a very important part of christianity that overlook above and make it possible to    love the sin but hate the sinner    before i look at someone else  s life and sin i look to myself and be a disgust by what i see in  me  a i see in others probably more self righteousness be contradictory to christianity and be what make the progression you describe happen if a christian can truthfully quote paul and say    wretched man that i be    roman 7 24 nasb that christian will be able to love the sinner and hate the sin if we have the attitude of the pharisee who say    i thank thee that i be not like other men        luke 18 11 nasb we will hate both    scott at brandeis
 yes mary be fully human however that do not imply that she be just a subject to sin a we be catholic doctrine say that man s nature be good gen 1 31 but be damage by original sin rom 5 12 16 in that case be undamaged by original sin mary be more fully human than any of the rest of u you ask why god can not    repeat the miracle    of mary  s preservation from original sin a well way to phrase it would be    why _did_ he not    do it that way but you misunderstand how mary  s salvation be obtain like ours the bless virgin mary  s salvation be obtain through the merit of the sacrifice of christ on the cross however a god be not bound by time which be his creation god be free to apply his sacrifice to anyone at any time even if that person live before christ come to earth from our time bound perspective therefore christ  s death and resurrection still serve a necessary purpose and be necessary even for mary  s salvation
 in the nt the clear reference be all from paul  s letter in rom 1 there be a passage that presupposes that homosexuality be an evil note that the passage about homosexuality    about idolatry homosexuality be visit on people a a punishment or at least result of idolatry there be a number of argument over this passage it do not use the word    homosexuality    and it be refer to people who be by nature heterosexual practice homosexuality so not what call an explicit teach against all homosexuality like say that murder be only wrong for those of u who natural murder and steal be only wrong for those of u who natural thief will
 david hammerslag ask how do you mormon reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ  s statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be give in marriage luke chapt 20 several explanation for this seem contradiction have be propose but most lds scholar whose opinion i have study take more or less one of the follow three position 1 jesus be talk to a group of people sadducee who be try to trip him up with what they felt be a silly hypothetical situa  tion that ridicule the concept of a resurrection something they believe in these people    and those associate with them    now there be with u seven brother    matt 22 25    would not be receptive to such high blessing a eternal marriage hence the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni  tie but that mean other more faithful people could not have this blessing 2 jesus be make a distinction between the state or condition of  being  married and the process of  becoming  married the latter activity marry and give in marriage will not take place in the eternity because all eternal marriage will be take care of before then 3 the account a we have it in all three of the synoptic gospel be miss something that would make it real meaning clearer note that we lds do not believe in biblical inerrancy so we do not in general feel oblige to reconcile each and every bible text with modern revelation through joseph smith and other latter day proph  ets nor be we particularly upset that the account in question be not significantly revise in the    joseph smith translation    or    inspire version    of the bible since we do not believe this work be complete or that failure to revise a passage in the jst con  stitutes divine approval of that passage a it stand in the kjv

 this may sound argumentative but do the pro homosexual crowd give the same support to church member that be involve in incestuous relationship if we do a little substitution above we get    although by no mean all episcopalian be sympathetic to incestuous men and woman there certainly be a fairly larget percentage in my experience who be i be good friend with an episcopalian minister who be ordain and living in a monogamous incestual relationship this in no way diminishes his ability to minister    in fact he have a very significant ministry with the incest association of his community        do the same standard apply if not why not and while in the ballpark what about bestiality i recall offhand if there be any direct statement in the bible regard sex with animal do that activity have more or less a sanction please avoid response such a    take this to extreme    i would guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant bible community view homosexual act with distaste in the same manner that society at large view incest                                                                                                          scott cokely 714 833 4760 scott cokely nb rockwell com    they come for the davidians but i do not speak up because i be not a davidian then they come for me        opinion express be mine and do not represent those of rockwell                                                                                                       obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by anything from murder to sleep late that mean that the same people would accept those substitution the question be whether the relationship involve do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to represent christ  s relationship to humanity this be at least  partly  an empirical question in some case type of human relationship have be reject because over time they always seem to lead to trouble i think the case with slavery one can argue that in theory if you follow paul s guideline possible to have christian slaveholder but in practice over a period of time most people come to the conclusion that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and not abuse it the message you be respond to be ask you to look at the result from christian community that endorse homosexuality note christian homosexual not people you see on the news advocate some extremist agenda you may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation but i would argue that at least relevant you answer the request by ask why you look at the incest association because in fact there be no such association if there be it might be reasonable for you to look at it too of course that mean that the result of all such examination would necessarily come out the same way part of why there group push all possible relaxed standard be that some of them do produce obviously bad result
 do anyone know of an english language edition that do not show the verse or even chapter number i have always thought that such an edition would be very useful although hard to navigate around i have a scot nt that show verse number and it be great to read particularly longer narrative passage but my scot quite up to do proper study from this edition i tend to use it to get a    feel    for a story particularly in the gospel and then use an english edition to look for detail alison
 way qub ac uk writes single angle bracket ng there be no question of similarity in jesus indication about john the passage in matthew be very direct where luke 1 17 report the angel gabriel prophesy that john will go before christ    in the power and spirit of elia    in matthew 11 14 jesus himself say of john    and if you care to accept it he himself be elijah who be to come    it be interest that jesus prepended the word    if you care to accept it    a if to say that the implication of this truth namely of rein  carnation i will not force on you but for those who can accept it here it be a jewish poster to other newsgroups on jewish esotericism and other topic have outline the esoteric cabbalistic jewish teach of of reincarnation and karma a teach that be little know among jew today but which be apparently widespread enough in israel that hannah hurnard    hind foot on high place    be told about it by a rabbi she be try to convert back in the 1940s a a missionary in palestine thus there may well have be a small number of jew who knew about this whereas the large number of people do not the statement of jesus about john the great human personality in the new testament be guard but nevertheless quite direct again the subject of reincarnation one way or another be not a subject of the new testament nor be the fate in general of the human be between death and the last judgement but there be occasional indication that point to it a for the    popular belief    that elijah would come again it be more than a popular belief a jesus confirms it in more than one place and he never correct those who be expect elijah    for example those who thought that jesus himself be he

 hypostasis explain it here before if you want the full document ask me by mail    rex    question arise a we begin to think about logo and what his inner consciousness be compose of we need to clarify the two nature of christ briefly the divine nature which have exist eternally do not undertake any essential change during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the attribute of god the foremost of these be his immutability this would mean that it remain impassable that be incapable of suffer and death free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation in the realm of the divine nature it be well to say that the son of god become that which be not absolute and in himself the result of the incarnation be that the divine logo could be ignorant and weak could be tempt and suffer and die not in his divine nature but by the derivation of his possession of a human nature this would mean that both the property of the divine nature and the human nature be property of the person and therefore ascribed to the person by this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent yet at the same time be also a man of limited power knowledge a man of sorrow subject to human want and misery there be however no penetration of one nature into the other deity can no more share the imperfection of humanity than humanity can share in the essential perfection of the godhead we be not to assume that there be a double personality due to the possession of the double nature christ  s human nature be impersonal in that it attains self consciousness and self determination in the personality of the god man we must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the man nature be define    the distinguish quality or property of something the fundamental character disposition or temperament of a living be innate and unchangeable    nature be then in essence the substance possess in common in a such the trinity have one nature there be also a common nature of mankind personality on the other hand be the separate subsistence of nature with the power of consciousness and will it be for this reason that the human nature of christ have not nor ever have a separate subsistence that it be impersonal logo the god man represent the principle of personality it be equally important to see that self consciousness and self determination do not a such belong to the nature it be for this reason that we can justifiably say that jesus do not have two consciousness or two will but rather one it be theanthropic an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the human and the divine nature be that neither the consciousness nor the will be simply human or simply divine    the quotation give above be not identify and not entirely clear to me what position loren be take on it just for clarity let me note that the view express in it be one of the classic christological heresy    monothelitism the position that christ  s two nature be not complete in that there be only one will in most case which i think include this example it be the human will that be regard a miss normally people who talk about christ  s human nature a be    impersonal    mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense that be they be use    person    a hypostatis not in the usual english sense of personality in this use the doctrine be call    anhypostasia    personally i think anhypostasia be just a more sophisticated way of deny that the logo take on humanity fully however it have never be formally rule a heresy and in fact have be held by influential theologian both ancient and modern e g athanasius but the quotation above appear to be go farther than even athanasius go into the realm of the overtly heretical
 imho this be go from bad to bad 3 in 1 1 in 3 be bad enough i do not like a god who prays to himself i refuse to believe jesus prayed to himself    let  s get real if the scripture say he prayed to the father then the father be someone different than the son i have no problem with multiple god to me the whole context of the scripture co heirs with christ that we will be like him co heirs share all thing equally    include knowledge power dominion etc when i be like him christ i will be the same a he be    and he be a god if god can not do this the his be not all powerful    and he be not god if he will not he be a liar    and he be not god but if he do he be the great of all the god

 there be exactly zero verse that    clearly    address the issue the kind of interpretation i see a    incredibly perverse    be that apply to the story of sodom a if it be a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christian cite the bible in such a context should be presume to have at least read the story it amount to slander    a charge that homosexuality    rape    to use that against u the moderator adequately discus the circularity of your use of _porneia_ in this i think we can all agree with paul that there be some kind of activity that could be name by    fornication    or    theft    or    covet    or    revile    or    drunkenness    which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bound of those category however and the very fact that they be argue over suggests that not only be the matter not at all    clear    but that paul    an excellent rhetorician    have no interest in make them clear leave matter rather to our spirit led decision with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that have dominate christian discussion of all these area homosexual behavior be no different i and the other gay christian i know be adamant in condemn rape    heterosexual or homosexual    and child molestation    heterosexual or homosexual    and even the possibly    harmless    but obsessive kind of sex    heterosexual or homosexual    that would stand condemn by paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite may i mildly suggest that what  paul  do in his letter that you want to use be perhaps a good guide to his meaning    i be free to do anything you say yes but not everything be for my good no doubt i be free to do anything but i for one will not let anything make free with me    1 cor 6 12 which be a restatement that we must have no other    god    before god a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wish to break some people be indeed involve in obsessively driven mode of sexual behavior it be just a wrong though slightly less incendiary so a secondary argument from the  phobic contingent to equate homosexuality with such behavior a to equate it with the rape of god  s messenger i deal with the exegesis of leviticus except very tangentially fundamentally you be exhibit the same circularity here a in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ mean there be plenty of law prohibit sexual behavior to be found in leviticus most of which christian ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just  assume  that they know which one be    moral    and which one be    ritual    well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs  unlcean a category in an awful lot of society we have them too but bury pretty deep and i can not see any ground for distinguish these bit of leviticus from the    ritual law    which no christian i know feel applies to u dead serious here when people start go on a they do in this matter about how    repulsive    and    unnatural    our act be    and what do they know about it huh    it be a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcation a the american prejudice against eat insect on what basis other than assume your conclusion can you say that the law against male male intercourse in leviticus be not a part of the ritual law for those christian who  do  think that  some  part of leviticus can be    law    for christian while others be not even to be thought about it be incumbent on you  in every case handle on it own merits  to determine why you    pick    one and ignore another i frankly think the whole effort misguide reread paul    no doubt i be free to do anything    but christian have a criterion to use for make our judgment on this the great commandment of love for god and neighbor if you can not go through leviticus and decide each    command    there on that basis then your own arbitrary selection from it be simply idiosyncracy in this context it be remarkably offensive to say well la ti da so what this be almost a slimey an argument a the one that homosexuality    rape i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find joker in    defense    of bestiality it be absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issue gay christian  do  raise which concern sexual activity within commit consensual human adult realtionships so that your bring it up be no more relevant than the law of kashrut if you can not address the actual issue you be be bloody dishonest in trail this red herring in front of the world if  you  want to address bestiality that be your business not mine and attempt to torpedo a serious issue by use what be in our culture a ridiculous joke show that you have no interest in hearing u a human being you want to dismiss u and use the sleaziest mean you can think of to do so jesus and paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch pin of christian moral thought we be require to love one another and all else depends on that gay and lesbian christ  ians challenge you to address the issue on those term    and all we get in return be cheap debate trick attempt to side track the issue christian no doubt very sincere one keep show up here and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they ever do be spout these same old verse which they obviously have never thought about maybe never even read in total ignorance of the issue raise slander u with the vilest charge of child abuse or whatever their perfervid mind can manage to conjure up toss out red herring with they suppose great emotional force to cause reader to dismiss our witness without even take the trouble to find out what it be such behavior should shame anyone who claim to have see truth in christ why for god  s precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verse to condemn people you know and even take the trouble to listen to before you start your condemnation be that love your neighbor god forbid be that how you obey the repeat command to not judge or condemn others christ and paul spend order of magnitude more time in insist on this than the half dozen obscure word in paul that you be so bloody ready to take a license to do what god tell you not to do why for god  s sake    for god do not send the son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be save through him whoever believe in him be not condemn but whoever do not believe have already be condemn for refuse to believe in the name of god  s only son now the judgment be this the light have come into the world but men have prefer darkness to light because their deed be evil for everyone who practice wickedness hate the light and do not come near the light for fear his deed will be expose but he who act in truth come into the light so that it may be sh0own that his deed be do in god    john 3 17 21 for long age we many of u have be confuse by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we come to the light we would be sham and reject some of u despair and take to course that probably  do  show a sinful shun of god  s light bless be those whose spirit have be crush by the self righteous they shall be justified however we have see the truth and the truth be the light of humanity and we now know that it be not we who fear the light but our enemy who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against u
 i get the feel that we be debate at cross purpose    that we do not see the same fundamental assumption and this perhaps make my answer orthogonal to your question i will try again perhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively observable and provable thing in that case i can not show you that there be such thing a a spirit or a spiritual need    these thing do not exist in the realm of the objective but in the realm of the subjective by a a  i assume you mean alcoholic anonymous and not alt atheism i would not say that aa    handle    spiritual need rather i would say that aa and other 12 step program help people come to term with their need    ie that aa be facilitate the recovery and that a part of the recovery they recognize their spiritual need and begin to rely on a    high power    12 step  s term to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse they have be accustom to sorry there be no objective proof here either    no way to take 2 identical alcoholic and try to have one recover by fulfil spiritual need and one without and externally compare the difference    we be talk about the virtually infinite complexity of  people  here spiritual need could be define a thing that people need in addition to physical requirement like air food sleep etc these be thing like the need for love and acceptance and the need for meaning in life if one denies the existence of spiritual thing one would presumably call these    emotional need    the reason christian call them spiritual need be that they have aspect that be not fulfillable except by spiritual mean    ie a person could be love and accepted by many people and do many meaningful thing but still have a need for love which can only be satisfied by the love of god now the problem be that there be people who accept the existence of these need and people who reject them since i believe in absolute truth some of these people be right and the others be wrong so here be the 2 possibility 1 if christian be right then we all have spiritual need    ie we all need god those who do not realize that they need god be delude    they just recognize it yet 2 if christian be wrong spiritual need be an artefact of our brain chemical well adjusted and properly integrated personality do not have such thing christian be simply use the concept of god and spiritual need to mask their own inadequacy i hate to belabour the point but the existence of spirit and spiritual need can not be objectively demonstrate or proven just like the existence of god can not and yes this mean that there be a risk that all my subjective evidence be manufacture by my brain chemical but on the other hand i could venture into solipsism and say that there be a risk that everything that i appear to objectively know be really manufacture by my brain chemical i suspect this be an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and demonstration of the existence of spirit and spiritual need but my assertion be that such thing be not objectively demonstrable a i have say before i myself be on the christian side of agnosticism have be push off the fence by subjective evidence and no i be not raise a christian so it be not a case of simply accept what i be indoctrinate with
 a recent post bear the subject line re serbian genocide work of god the text contains 80 line devote to a defence of the doctrine of predestination a apply to the salvation of individual there be then a five line post script on the balkan it be natural and easy to keep the subject line of the post that one be reply to but when the focus shift keep the same subject can cause confusion this be intend a a general request the post mention be just the handiest example
 when i need a kick butt god or when i need assurance of the reality of truth i pray to god the father when i need a friend someone to put his arm around me and cry with me i pray to jesus when i need strength or wisdom to get through a difficult situation i pray for the holy spirit i realize that the above will probably make some people cringe but what can i say i think the doctrine of the trinity be an attempt to reconcile jesus be god and be distinct from god a described in the bible i wonder if jesus have be a hindu how different the word would be
 anyone who think be gay and christianity be not compatible should check out dignity integrity more light presbyterian church affirmation mcc church etc meet some gay christian find out who they be pray with them discus scripture with them and only  then  form your opinion
 continue part 4 i think use by permission the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai with implication for christian ethic and ministry james b  deyoung w  petersen more recently wright  s understand have itself be question from a different direction in a brief 1986 study william petersen found linguistic confusion in use the english word    homosexual    a the meaning of arsenokoitai 22 he fault wright and english bible translaions for render it by    homosexual    in i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10  in a sense petersen have coalesce bailey boswell and scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of bailey he find    homosexual    unacceptable a a translation because it be anachronistic    a major disjunction    exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in paul  s time 187 88 what be this    disjunction    he base it on historical and linguistic fact accordingly ancient greek and roman society treat male sexuality a polyvalent and characterize a person sexually only by his sexual act virtually all form of behavior except transvestism be acceptable christianity simply add the category of    natural    and    unnatural    in describe these action ancient society know nothing of the category of    homosexual    and    heterosexual    and assume that in the word of dover quote approvingly by petersen    everyone responds at different time to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimulus    188 23 in contrast to this modern usage virtually limit the term    homosexual    to desire and propensity k m benkert who in 1869 coin the german term equivalent to    homosexual    use it a refer to orientation impluse or affectional preference and have    nothing to do with sexual act    189 petersen then proceeds to cite the    supplement to the oxford english dictionary    which defines    homosexual    only a a propensity or desire with no mention of act petersen  s point be that by use    homosexual    for arsenokoitai one wrongfully read a modern concept back into early history    where no equivalent concept exist    189 consequently the translation be inaccurate because it    include celibate homophile incorrectly exludes heterosexual who engage in homosexual act and incorrectly include female homosexual    19 89 prior to 1869 there be no    cognitive structure either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into  homosexuals and  hetersosexuals make sence    189 the forego clarifies why petersen feel that the translatio    homosexual    be mistaken yet be it possible that petersen be the one mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological ground the next phase of this paper will critically examine petersen  s position the justification for translate arsenokoitai by    homosexual    historical ground a refutation of the forego opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by    homosexual    begin with the historical and cultural evidence since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word do not appear before paul s usage no historical setting earlier than his be available yet much write reveals that ancient understand of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul the goal be to discover wheither the ancient s conceive of homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to present day concept peterson bailey boswell and scroggs claim that the homosexual condition desire propensity or inversion  whatever it be called  can not be part of the definition of the term they assert this either because the term be limited to act of particular kind boswell active male prostitute scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition be unknown in ancient time bailey petersen the follow discussion will show why neither of these position be legitimate attention will be devote to the latter postion first with the former one be address below under    linguistic ground    in regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask do not the homosexual condition exist before 1869 be it only a modern phenomenon yet if it be universal a allege today it must have exist always include ancient time even though there be lack of sophistication in discuss it indeed evidence show that the ancient pre christian and christian not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior include all form of same sex activity transvestism include but also knoew about same sex orientation or condition petersen admits 190 n  10 that plato in    symposium    189d 192d may be a    sole possible exception    to ancient ingnorance of this condition he discount this however believe that even here    act appear to be the decide factor    however this be a very significant exception hardly worthy of be call    an exception    because of the follow additional evidence for a homosexual condition the    symposium    of plato give some of the strong evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition 24 plato posit a third sex comprise of a maile female androgynon    man woman    hence    original nature    palai physis consist of three kind of human being zeus slice these human being in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the god consequently each person seek his or her other half either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex plato then quote aristophances each of u

sex that at first be call man woman be woman courters our adulterer be mostly descend from that sex whence likewise be derive our mancourting woman and adulteress all the woman who be section of the woman have no great fancy for men they be incllined rather to woman and of this stock be the she minions men who be section of the male pursue the masculine and so long a their boyhood last they show themselves to be slice of the male by make griends with men and delight to lie with them and to be clasped in men  s embrasces these be the fine boy and stripling for they have the most manly nature some say they be shameless creature but falsely for their behavior be due not to shamelessness but to dare manliness and virility since they be quick to welcome their like sure evidence of this be the fact that on reach maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men so when they come to man  s estate they be boy lovers and have no natural interest in wive and get child but only do these thing under stress of custom they be quite content to live together unwedded all their day a man of this sort be at any rate born to be a lover of boy or the willing mate of a man eagerly greet his own kind well when one of them  whether he be a boy lover or a lover of any other sort  happens on his own particular half the two of them be wondrously thrill with affection and intimacy and love and be hardly to be induced to leave each other  s side for a single moment these be they who continue together throughout life though they could not even say what they would have of one another 191d 192c 25 should these two person be offer the opportunity to be fuse together for a long a they live or even in hades aristophanes say that each    would unreservedly deem that he have be offer just what he

be also present far mention of and or allusion to permanecy mutality    gay pride    pederasty homophobia motive desire passion and the nature of love and it work be recognizable clearly the ancient thought of love homosexual or other apart from action the speaker in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality be crucial money office influence etc bring reproach 182e 183a 184b they mention the need to love the soul not the body 183e there be tow kind of love in the body 186b and each have it    desire    and    passion    186b d the speaker discus the principle or    matter    of love

felt for    what be not provide or present for something they have not or be not or lack    this be the object of desire and love socrates clearly distinguishes between    what sort of be be love    and the    work    of love 201e this ancient philosopher could think of both realm  seaual act a well a disposition of be or nature his wors have significance for more than pederasty 26 in summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality be anticipate in the symposium of plato petersen be in error when he claim that the ancient could only think of homosexual act not inclination or orientation widespread evidence to the contray support the latter 27 biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the context where homosexual act be discribed add to the

 note the follow article be submit on behalf of someone frank daniel who have difficulty post to s r c email reply to daniel math ufl edu i be unable to post to the bitnet group here be a capsule history of the shepherding discipleship movement in the church of christ i e crossroads boston i could trace the movement back a far a 1800 and indeed some of it root go back that far but these be really    influence    on the movement and not the actual movement per se i will start in c 1920 in that day there be  white church and  colored church in nearly every area due to segregation modern pentecostalism be develop a a predominantly  colored phenomenon here there be great fanaticism emphasis on emotional experience and belief in a personal guidance and indwell of the holy spirit many  white protestant church be grow into what become know a conservative fundamentalism by the 1940s the evangelical movement be in full swing and many group be become part of it when the civil right movement grow strong in the 1950  s and 1960  s many  white church group begin to be influence by the  black church and by what be go on there this spread start in the most liberal of group and spread to the more conservative one by the late  60  s in 1969 even the catholic church be display evidence of influence by the other group     still evident today the church of christ be and be a very conservative protestant group when the influence from outside begin to reach the cofc in c 1965 it be generally not appreciate conservative group be very strongly resistant to change and the new movement be very different from the cofc status quo the magazine put out at that time by cofc folk tell the story a it unfolds new idea come into the cofc there be a big push to reach out to college student young adult and teen some call this the campus evangel  ism movement emotion generally not highly regard in the cofc at large played a more important role in the new movement in some place people begin to speak in tongue a their pentecostal predecessor do this be met with extreme criticism from within the church of christ in some place people be fire from their job for speak in tongue or for advocate the    holy spirit movement    another name for the new branch the term    underground church of christ    also come into use because these people have to hide their difference or they might be ostricised there be several congregation however whose leadership be receptive to the new idea at least in part the tongues speaking never really caught on one of these be the 14th street church of christ in gainesville fl campus ministry have already be regard a important at 14th street and the new idea seem to be very helpful tool for evangelism they also seem to put vitality into the church which many felt have be lack in october of 1967 the 14th street congregation hire chuck lucas to be it campus minister by 1970 he would move to be the congregation s lead minister in the late 60 s early 70  s the congregation work with many other group they held bible discussion at daytona beach during spring break they organize talk in the fraternity on the university of florida campus they also work with uf sport people in 1972 the congregation order a large building to be construct when it be finish the group move and change it name now no longer appropriate it become the crossroad church of christ from then on a name that would become legendary by this time crossroad be basically the only cofc whose program be fully align to the new movement while they start it they continued it and be responsible for where it wound up go by 1975 none of the other church of christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with crossroad due to what they recognize a doctrinal problem at crossroad crossroad have begin to heavily emphasize and later require attendance at all church function it be see a a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship a person with whom you would share all of your problem pray and get help from the concept be call prayer partner which later become discipleship partner and also later become mandatory the leadership be assign prayer partner to people for a while the book call    the master plan of evangelism    be a strong influence on chuck lucas he and the group believe that it be every person  s duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission crossroad be grow in number and number become very important some would say all important a person who    be evangelistic    be    spiritual    evangelism meant invite people to crossroad event if you do this a lot and some of them convert then you be    spiritual    there be sermon about how if you bought grocery the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitation to service everyone at your job ought to receive invitation since these people need jesus you should be    aggressive       take  no for an answer if you do not evangelize enough you come to be call    lazy    or    unspiritual    by the end of the decade the prayer partner system be integrate into a structure the elder and minister be on top like a big pyramid then the group leader bible study leader and member everyone who come in have someone place over them it be at this time 1978 1980 that the bad press about crossroad begin to circulate the problem with rape on the university of florida campus be tremendous but crossroad be consider a big and more immediate problem there be many complaint about the congregation and it    pushy    evangelistic tactic crossroad be consider the other church of christ to be    dead    church which aggravate them it be aggressively recruiting out of the other church group denomination which aggravate them by this time crossroad have grown numerically to the point 1100 where not only do they believe that they would soon need a new building but also they be send out    plant    create a new church and    reconstruct    reorganize an exist church team to other city by this time the crossroad movement be underway a group be sent to the 30 member lexington church of christ in boston ma the team be head up by kip mckean who have be convert out of a fraternity by crossroad in gainesville kip held a still strong view of church authority which he believe be heavily vested in the evangelist s and not so much in the elder he have be fire in 1977 from the congregation that he have be work at when the elder there found numerous thing wrong with his theology include the practice of what come to be call one over  one christianity call this by critic in the first year half of the 30 people felt that they do not want to be a part of the new congregation they left but others begin come into the new boston church of christ ah but ahead of myself at crossroad the heavy handed system have begin to take it toll on the member many have say that they felt that they be work hard but they be not achieve the result that be so important the number be drop from 1978 crossroad membership decline steadily the leadership begin to tighten the reign on the congregation who be see a be largely    unproductive    and    unfruitful    the    fruit    passage in the nt be interpret a refer to new convert if you be not bearing fruit say john 15 you would be cast into the fire boston still teach this if you love your neighbor save his soul invite him to church and convert him if not do that you love your neighbor and if you love in danger of backsliding the logical argument continue in this vein in 1985 chuck lucas be fire from his job a minister due to recur sin in his life these struggle be never reveal to the congregation at large although many people outside the congregation have heard about them for by now there be very little contact on a friendship level between most crossroad member and those outside if you have contact your focus should be on convert them bring them to a bible study chuck  s replacement be joe wood who be fully supportive of the boston system a boston grow in number they begin to offer  training session for other minister joe go to boston to be train and return to cross  road ready to emphasize the    total commitment    to the church that boston and kip mckean be now emphasize eventually in fall of 1987 the elder at crossroad now 2 in number    dick whitehead and bill hogle make a decision boston be demand that all of the other church in the movement come under the direction of the church in boston the elder refuse cite their belief that each church should be autonomous something true in all non boston church of christ perhaps there be also some degree of offense do here since crossroad be no longer the  example to the rest of the movement the group now numbered about 800 while boston be now large in membership the church of christ generally teach that baptism be a necessary element of salvation at crossroad they taught what be call  lordship  baptism you have to understand the commitment involve before you could be baptize you have to  count the cost at boston they take this a step far if at some time you become    unproductive    then your spirituality be suspect people would begin to ask you if you really understood what you be get into anyone who say  no have their baptism deem invalid they count the cost properly they still have to be baptize others call this    rebaptism    and crossroad approve of this practice when crossroad announce that it would not follow boston many of it member left crossroad and go to movement related ministry which be now call discipling ministry you be either discipling evangelize or you be    dead    they also use the nickname    movement of god    for a while by summer of 1988 crossroad be withdrawn from the movement and now stood alone they have few to no ally in the mainstream church of christ and now none in the movement boston however continued to chart it course in the direction that they have be follow they sent    reconstruction team    to many city which usually meant that they split the church there they stop acknowledge other church of christ a christian and begin to call themselves the    remnant    the    remnant    of the jew in the ot be those who be save by god it be felt that the    remnant    today represent all the christian sometimes they would simply call their movement    the church    they usually take the name of the city for their name imply to the other church of christ that boston do not recognize their existence many campus have now formally forbidden boston ministry from recruiting there due to the number of complaint in some case it have be document that boston ministry have lie to university official in order to continue to have access to the campus any resistance that they experience be term    perse  cution    which all true christian be expect to experience be you really a christian if not be persecute the number at boston peaked at c 3000 in 1989  since then they have fought to remain steady i have heard a tape of kip mckean shout at the leader for fail to fulfill the great commission their life  s purpose a god command them their christianity be highly center on command and obedience crossroad once be call a cult boston be now recognize by the cult awareness network and other national and international group a a cult under a formal definition because of the technique which they employ the term    cult    be usually differentiate from    sect    by the practice of those technique the technique which they employ be recognize by many a be technique of destructive pursuasion also use by other shepherd discipleship group robert jay lifton margaret thaler singer and many others have write about the topic these technique include guilt motivation emotional manipulation load language the aura of sacred science a sort of mystic element see in everyday event and others i have no particular axe to grind against the movement i have numer  ous friend who be still part of the movement i have never have a  falling out with anyone in the movement i disagree with many thing which they teach i recognize the psychological damage do by be involve in such a system i hold no loyalty to the mainstream church of christ and do not defend their mistake either i want to point out though that unlike in many other system which be in other way similar the leadership of the boston movement be a much victim of the system a the member we do not have a leader who enjoys manipulate his people the leader believe what they teach and they feel accountable for the activites and spiritual welfare of the member when member do not evangelize to their expectation for example the leader feel personally responsible a well the leader be not out for money or power they want to evangelize the world in their lifetime i have say too much but there be much more to say there be many example i could give and quote from other source include boston bulletin that i could include but this be too long already you may post this if you so desire frank d
 i see a parallel between what i will stupidly call the    homosexual    issue and the    atheist    issue please take no offense at these comparison the homosexual    feel    thing that i admit i do not    feel    he learns that these feeling be classify a homosexual feeling and learns of a model of sexuality that seem to apply to his feeling which he then can fit with his experience that be this model give him a sense of understand his situation model that do not match up with what he know he feel will be discard however one wonder if once accept the idea of his be gay and decide what exactly that mean he will analyze all his feeling and experience base on the definition he have already accepted which of course validates his model if that be hard to understand now listen to my parallel the christian    feel    thing that an atheist claim he do not feel the christian accepts the christian theology a the true description of what his feeling mean once accept this model he interprets his experience with regard to this model which of course validates his christianity a a reminder i be a christian a catholic i hate homosexual or atheist but be just try to understand them i only compare them because they be both so foreign to me be i a blind to the homosexual a the atheist seem blind to me or be i a prejudice against atheistic denial of religious experience a the homosexual be prejudice against attempt by society to deny his sexuality or be i just out to lunch again
 my roommate the atheist say    to anyone out there who might be listen
 i think that if someone often have immoral dream like lustful dream or dream where you commit act of violence etc etc it may be a sign that he have something sinful in his heart it may be the holy spir way of allow the sinfulness that be in u to come to light so that we can pray about it and have it remove generally if one have a pure heart and set his mind on thing that be holy he will be holy even when he dream dream also can be from the lord joseph and nebucadnezzar be two example of people in the bible who receive dream from the lord regard out of body experience this be something that we have to be careful with what be call an oobe can be spiritual in nature especially if what one saw be the same a an experience witness by someone else christian should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate an out of body experience some thing that might be call an oobe might actually be from the lord paul write of what might of be an oobe in ii corinthian 12 he write of a spiritual experience of be caught up into the third heaven be an oobe truely an oobe do one really leave his body or be he just see an image be show to him by a spirit be it a demon or the holy spirit i think it matter that much paul could not tell be that a it may we should be careful not to open ourselves up to satan to experience oobe  s we should not meditate and pretend we be in a place until our spirit apparently float there this be dangerous if god want to gice u what seem like an oobe then he can do that of his own sovereign will in the bible most often it seem that prophet be just take up by god  s sovereign will and not because they be seek an oobe john be in the spirit pray on the lord  s day when he be caught up in the vision he receive ezekial be talk with some jewish leader when he be caught up into the vision of god one time if god want to take one of u up into a vision he can do it people should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirit for the sake of a few thrill
 indeed the immediate context nasb be 26 otherwise he would have need to suffer often since the foundation of the world but now once at the consummation he have be manifest to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself 27 and inasmuch a it be appoint for men to die once and after this come judgement 28 so christ also have be offer once to bear the sin of many shall appear a second time not to bear sin tro those who eagerly await him the first point be that this verse be part of an even large context the subject of which be not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of christ s sacrifice    once    and the fulfillment of the law for all of fall mankind rudolf frieling elaborates this in detail in his    christianity and reincarnation    the thrust of the passage in it context be to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human be after death the    once    be repeat and emphasize and it highlight the singularity of christ  s deed one thing for certain it do be to refute the claim of some that christ incarnates more than once but the comparison to the human experience die once then judgement note not    the judgement    but just    judgement    the word for judgement be    krisis    hebrew 9 27 be the one passage most often quote in defense of the doctrine that the bible denies reincarnation at this point i would just emphasize again that the passage that arguably speak against it be few and that invariably they be talk about something eles and the apparent denial of reincarnation be either infer or a in the case of hebrew take literally and deposit into an imply context namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human be after death what should be consider seriously be that the bible be essentially silent about the fate of the individual human be between death and the last day if you take the few passage that could possibly be interpret to mean a single earth life they be arguable and there be other passage that point arguably in the other direc  tion such a matthew 11 14 and john 9 2  we can continue to debate the individual scrap of scripture that might have a bearinig on this and indeed we should discus them but what i want to introduce into the discussion be an approach to the idea of repeat earth life that unlike hindu buddhist and    new age    teaching take full cognizance of the divinity singular incarnation death burial resurrection and second come of christ a the savior of mankind the accountability of each individual for his deed and the reality of the fall and of sin and it consequence the redemption of man from sin through christ the resurrection of the body and the last judgement take in this large sense many serious question take on an entirely different perspective e g the destiny of those who die in their sin before christ come the relationship of faith and grace to work the meaning of    deathbed conversion    the meaning of the sacrament and many other thing not that i propose to answer all those question by a simple doctrine of convenience but only that the discussion take on a different dimension and in my opinion one that be truly worthy of both man the earth and their creator and redeemer there be many deep question that continue to be deep such a the meaning of the second death and how the whole of christian doctrine would apply to this large perspective of human existence there be those who deeply believe that the thing of which the bible do not speak be not thing we should be concerned with but christ also indicate that there be other thing that we would come to know in the future include thing that his disciple and therefore others could not bear yet this idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge not only of the individual in one lifetime but of the whole of humanity also take on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit be a long term process the bible be not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeem deed of christ take the gospel in the great context from genesis to revelation now salvation heal becomes not the end of man  s sojourn but it begin and the last judgement and the new heaven and earth that follow it become it fulfullment
 fred gilham asks whether it be true that goedel write a version of the ontological argument for the existence of god yes it be true someone have publish a rebuttal point out certain flaw in the argument and recently professor c anthony anderson of the philosophy department of the university of minnesota have write a revise version of the argument perhaps free of flaw and at any rate free of the flaw complain of in the original version he have sent me a copy which i still have i saw it last week when i be look for something else and when it surface again i can supply particular my guess be that it be be publish or already have be in the journal of symbolic logic
 there be an article in usa today a few month ago show the result of a study that actually only about 1 be homosexual i saw another figure that list 2 a the figure of course even if it be 99 that would have little bearing on whether or not it be a sinful behavior how many people have commit other act of fornication how many people have lie or sin in other way why it a specific feature of homosexuality paul describes    men with men work that which be unseemly    to describe the act sure there spirtual nature be deprave also and like the other sin the idolatry the other sexual immoraity and the other sin sprang from their deprave spiritual state which be a result of man  s not glorify god a god and be thankful still their act be shameless be everything sinful specifically elaborate on in the new testament scripture do not condemn be a drug dealer be rule by the spirit rather than the letter not only free from legalism it also protects u from sin that be against the spirit the word be a two edge sword that cut both way i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus if the law be reflection of god  s character and true holy nature then those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem if homosexuality be    natural    whatever that mean wholesome endorse by god and those who oppose sexual behavior be narrow minded biggots a some would have u believe why be there a condemnation of it in leviticus this condemnation be in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnation and there be nothing in the text to say that this law be limited to temple prostitution and no good reason to believe that this be the case furthermore male homosexual sex be a death penalty crime be every sin elaborate on in the new testament take a look at i corinthian 5  paul say that one of the corinthian have broken a law not even heard of among the gentile that one should have his father s wife there be a prohibition against have your father  s wife in leviticus no other new testament verse clearly condemns it besides this one notice that paul do not say that the sin be in commit adultery etc   he spoke against have one  s father  s wife notice also that this sexual condemnation in leviticus be not mention in the specific context of paganism either and there be no pagan coustom mention in i corinthian either a a matter of fact take one  s father  s wife even do among the gentile it be just a plain blantant sin whether worship idol be involve or not one of the reason that some of u do not accept that common argument be because paul probably do face this and other problem sin can be tough to over come especially without supernatural power be homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin like lust after a married woman or sleep around with people of the opposite sex i doubt it and even if it be that be no excuse god be great than all of it another reason we reject it be because it ignores the supernatural power of god to intervene in this kind of situation how many people have be set free from sin by the power of god sure there may be any group that have try to change homosexual and fail that be a reflection on the people involve in the program and not god  s willingness and ability to change a sinner any program that us formula may fail what people need be the power of god to change them whether they be involve in homosexual sin or any other sin i see how you come to that conclusion paul  s dealing with pastorial issue encourage people to give up their liberty in order to spare others  not to allow people to continue in sin because it be just too difficult take the example of eat meat offer to idol paul felt that there be nothing wrong in an abstract sense with eat the meat yet he advise believer to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others but paul never allow people to sin because living holy be just to tough paul write to    make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof    roman 13 14 then he go in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the conscience of others suppose it be not a sin for people to practice homosexual act since others consider it to be a sin then use paul  s approach on pastorial issue those who would otherwise be homosexual should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex paul never offer a lesser sin homosexual    marriage    to prevent people from engage in what may be consider a more damage sin yet marriage itself be not a sin marriage be holy in all  and something that god ordains and paul recognizes this actually adam be put in the garden to tend to it before he fell after he fell he would have to toil over the ground that be why we be dependent totally on god  what a vunerable and glorious position to be it we all must be transform by the renew of our minds  and that be the only way homosexual can walk in freedom just like anyone else sure you can see how people with the oppose view see this conclusion like say    how should i kill myself with gun or aresenic what about the person who just be overcome with a desire to sleep with goat would it be well for him to sleep with one goat or all of them what about the person who want to sleep with his aunt would it be well for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them in all these case the more people or animal one sleep with the high the chance that they will get a disease but this only deal with physical aspect of the question whichever sin be commit it all lead to spiritual death the issue that be most often address in scripture seem to be the actual act second it historical snobbery to say that only homosexual of this century be capable of have    love relationship    there be ancient writing glorify homosexual    love    btw i be one who believe in refrain from make oathes also where do you get that tax collector be sinner certainly not explicit jesus tell zachias to quit his job link hudson
 i have notice that newspaper even know what a fundamentalist be at the least they confuse new evangelicals and fundamentalist in this news group the liberal even know what a fundamentalist be cry out    legalist    at anyone who believe and obeys god  s word a fundamentalist would train their child in the way god proscribes not in the way that man proscribes this would not include life threaten beating but would include corporal punishment to the liberal i cry out infidel at anyone who do not believe god  s word signature follow    your statute be wonderful therefore i obey them    psalm 119 129                                                                           david l  hanson any opinion express be my own a most people here know i believe fundamentalist be sufficiently ill defined that i advise use some more specific term i think many people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of related concept e g denial of evolution while the original fundamental movement be somewhat more specific i would think most people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original agenda it include a list of key traditional doctrine e g the virgin birth the term be now be use by the press to describe aggressive conservative religion in general most typically those who be attempt to legislate religion legalism be yet another ill defined term however there be some reason for it use in this context in fact the common theological definition be the believe that salvation be through the law i hope no one here believe that our conservative contributor hold this view however there be a basic difference in approach over what we expect to get out of the bible the conservative approach expect to find specific behavioral rule generally the poster advocate this approach talk about the relevant passage from paul  s letter a god s law the liberal approach expect to find general principle but it regard specific behavioral rule subject to change depend upon the culture and other thing easy to see why a liberal would regard the conservative approach a legalism hard to know quite what other term to use the issue in this case be not inerrancy because no one be say that paul make a factual error rather the question be whether his statement be to be take a law call the positive answer legalism seem obvious enough terminology i see any good alternative
 how about act 11 15 18 22 23 or i john 4 1 8 which say to  try  the spirit to see if they be of god how do you know when have you try to learn anything about me
 aside to the moderator i quote any of it but there be several error in the article not thing that be just difference of opinion but the writer just plain have his fact confuse for example kip mckean be  asked  to come to the lexington church by the leader there he brought no team he actually have be in charleston il up to that point he have many friend even leader in gainesville tell him not to go because people in the northeast    open    and be waste his time and talent really this fact be a kind of    inside joke    at one point after the church in boston take off so well     not open indeed i could take it on point by point but i be not in a position to know one way or the other about some thing in the article i just want to point out that it contains misinformation mark
 anyway your argument seem to be say    if _i_ be god i certainly do thing that way therefore god do thing that way
 ok what  s more important to gay christian sex or christianity christianity i would hope would they be willing to forgo sex completely in order to avoid be a stumble block to others to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong etc if not why not heterosexual abstain all the time it would be nice if protestant church have celibate order to show the world that sex be not the important thing in life the difference be that straight member be give the choice of abstain or not and celibacy be recognize a a gift give only to some gay be told that a a condition of acceptance they _must_ be celibate i believe that god give me a force choice between have a relationship with god and express my heterosexuality within the context of a faithful relationship nor do i believe that god give that force choice to gay sex or christianity be a false dichotomy to tell the truth gay church remind me a lot of henry the viii start the church of england in order to get a divorce or be this a myth note that i be not deny that gay christian be christian for my part gay church remind me of black start their own church either because they be not allow at all in the white church or at best only with special restriction that do not apply to white member

the unprecedented international wave of condolence and adulation report one could be forgiven for assume that this man be a saint and a martyr certainly it be not the death and resurrection of christ jesus which dominate the thought and headline of south africa this easter but the assassination of chris hani the stun hypocrisy of the situation be that 20 135 people be murder in south africa in

2 tim 4 14 15 and so do our lord matt 11 20 24 what then should our attitude towards the imprecatory psalm be should we be pray the psalm to tackle these thorny issue i would like to present a short summary of an excellent book    war psalm of the prince of peace lesson from the imprecatory psalm    by james e adam publish by the presbyterian and reform publishing company our lord jesus christ his apostle use the psalm constantly in teach men to know god the new testament nt quote the old testament ot over 283 time 41 of all ot quote in the nt be from the psalm christ himself allude to the psalm over 50 time the psalm be the prayer book of the bible 1  be the imprecatory psalm the oracle of god some christian commentator theologian reject these psalm a    devilish       diabolical       unsuited to the church    and    not god  s pronouncement of his wrath on the wicked but the prayer of a man for vengeance on his enemy just the opposite of jesus  teach that we should love our enemies     yet 2 tim 3 16 17 declares    all scripture be god breathe and be useful for teach rebuke correct and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equip for every good work     see also 2 peter 3 15 16 the fact that something in the word of god be beyond our comprehension be not ground to deny or even question it inspiration to make ourselves the judge of what be good or evil be to impudently take the place of god do we imagine ourselves to be holier than god wrong idea of god have lead many to become    evangelic plastic surgeon who have make it their job to    clean up    god  s word accord to their own idea of what be proper they have forgotten that it be god alone who must determine what christianity be and what be suitable for his church the essence of what many have do be to question the authority of god  s word like eve  s original sin of listen to satan  s question    yes hath god say        the psalm be part of god  s revelation of himself and his attribute and they be reaffirm by the nt a the authoritative word of god those imprecatory psalm which these evangelical plastic surgeon reject a    unsuited    and    unworthy    for the church be the very psalm christ use to testify about himself eg mark 12 36 matt 22 43 44 and which the apostle use a authoritative scripture eg act 1 16 20 act 4 25 heb 4 7 see also 2 samuel 23 1 2  ch spurgeon say concern the imprecatory psalm especially p 109    truly this be one of the hard place of scripture a passage which the soul tremble to read yet it be not ours to sit in judgement upon it but to bow our ear to what the lord would speak to u therein     the rejection of any part of god  s word be a rejection of the giver of that word god himself 2  who be pray these psalm christ quote the psalm not merely a prophesy he actually spoke the psalm a his own word the psalm occupy an enormous place in the life of our lord he use it a his prayer book and song book from the synagogue to the festival and at the last supper on the cross christ quote from the psalm not a some ancient authority that he adapt for his own use but a his very own word the word of the lord  s anoint which a david  s son he truly be    father into your hand i commit my spirit    p 31 5    my god my god why have you forsaken me    p 22 1 in his ministry christ foretells what he will say a the judge on the day of judgement and he quote the psalm in do so matt 7 23    then i will tell them plainly i never knew you away from me you evildoers      p 6 8 in heb 10 5 the apostle attribute p 40 6 8 directly to christ although nowhere in the gospel be christ record a have say these word similarly hebrew 2 12 attribute p 22 22 directly to christ despite there be no record of his have spoken these word while on earth clearly the apostle believe christ be speak in the psalm christ come to establish his kingdom and to extend his mercy in all the earth but let u never forget that jesus will come again to execute judgement on the wicked david a the anoint king of the chosen people of god be a prototype of jesus christ act 2 30    be therefore a prophet     he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of christ     david be a witness to christ in his office in his lite and in his word the same word which david spoke the future messiah spoke through him the prayer of david be prayed also by christ or well christ himself prayed these psalm through his forerunner david the imprecatory psalm be expression of the infinite justice of god of his indignation against wrong do and his compassion for the wrong 3  but what about the psalm of repentance christ be also the lamb of god the substitutionary sacrifice for our sin christ in the day of his crucifixion be charge with the sin of his people he appropriate to himself those debt for which he have make himself responsible our lord be the substitution for the sinner he take the sinner place isaiah 53    god make him who have no sin to be sin for u so that in him we might become the righteousness of god     2 cor 5 21 in history the psalm especially the imprecatory psalm have be understood to have be the prayer of christ by st augustine jerome ambrose tertullian luther and many others all the psalm be the voice of christ christ be pray the imprecatory psalm all the psalm be messianic it be the lord jesus christ who be pray these prayer of vengeance it be only right for the righteous king of peace to ask god to destroy his enemy these prayer signal an alarm to all who be still enemy of king jesus his prayer will be answer god  s word be reveal upon all who oppose christ anyone who reject god  s way of forgiveness in the cross of christ will bear the dreadful curse of god he who prays psalm 69 23 28 will one day make this prayer a reality when he declares to those on his left    depart from me you who be curse into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels     matt 25 41 all the enemy of the lord need to hear these psalm  god s kingdom be at war the power of evil will tall and god alone will reign forever    with justice he judge and make war     out of his mouth come a sharp sword with which to strike down the nation he will rule them with an iron sceptre he tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god almighty     king of king and lord of lords     rev 19 15 4  be jesus prayer contradictory what about jesus command to love our enemy and to bless those who curse u matt 5 44 christ be of course the love and merciful saviour who forgives sin but he be also the awesome judge who be come in judgement on those who disobey his gospel    god be just he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who be troubled     this will happen when the lord jesus be reveal from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angel he will punish those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus they will be punish with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from the majesty of his power on the day he come to be glorify in his holy people and to be marvel at among au those who have believed     2 thess 1 6 10 jesus have power on earth to forgive sin and he have power on earth to execute judgement upon his enemy in the psalm we see both the vengeance and the love ot god even in the n t in the gospel we see imprecation    woe to you     hypocrite     blind guide     blind fool     full of greed and self indulgence     whitewash tomb     you snake you brood of viper how will you escape be condemn to hell    matt 23 in matt 26 23 24 christ quote from p 69 and 109 to refer to his betrayal by juda we also need to acknowledge that christ  s prayer of blessing be not for all in john 17 6 9 it be clear that christ be only pray to the elect of god those who have    obeyed your word           accepted    god  s word     and have    believe    see luke 10 8 16 those who reject the message of god  s kingdom will be judged 5  may we pray the imprecatory psalm martin luther point out that when one prays    hallow be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be do    then    he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say  curses malediction and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom may they be ruin and torn apart and may all their scheme and wisdom and plan run aground    to pray tor the extension of god  s kingdom be to solicit the destruction of all other kingdom eg dan 2 44    the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed     it will crush all those kingdom and bring them to an end but it will itself endure forever     advance and victory for the church mean defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness there be a life death struggle between two kingdom the church can not exclude hatred tor satan  s kingdom from it love for god s kingdom god  s kingdom can not come without satan  s kingdom be destroyed god  s will can not be do on earth without the destruction of evil the glory of god demand the destruction of evil instead of be influence by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assume but really non existent right of man we should focus instead upon the right of god note psalm 83 where the psalmist prays against those who    plot together    against god and his people    cover their face with shame so that men will seek your name o lord     do to them a you do to midian a you do to sisera and jabin at the river kishon who perish at endor and become like refuse on the ground     the story of sisera in the book of judge chapter 4 and 5 provide a vivid example of god  s judgement on the wicked sisera    cruelly oppress the israelite for twenty year    and they    cry to the lord for help    judge 4 3  in response to those prayer    the lord rout sisera and all his chariot and army by the sword and sisera abandon his chariot and flee on foot     all the troop of sisera fell by the sword not a man be left     judge 4 15 16 the account then go on to describe how sisera escape to the tent of jael where she lull him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer the song of victory by deborah and barak celebrate the crush of the head of sisera in graphic detail judge 5 25 27 and it be this that psalm 83 implores god to again do to his enemies      a you do to sisera        6  the blessing of obedience and the curse of disobedience the imprecatory psalm be fully consistent with the law of god    if you do not carefully follow all the word of this law which be write in this book and do not revere this glorious and awesome name the lord your god the lord will send fearful plague on you and your descendant he will bring upon you all the disease of egypt that you dread and they will cling to you the lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not record in this book of the law until you be destroyed     because you do not obey the lord your god     so it will please him to ruin and destroy you you will be uprooted from the land you be enter to possess     deuteronomy 28 58 63 the covenant god make with his people include curse for disobedience a well a blessing for obedience deuteronomy 27 record the formal give and receive of the covenant term in an awesome account    the levite shall recite to all the people of israel in a loud voice    curse be the man who carves an image or cast an idol a thing detestable to the lord the work of the craftsman  s hand and set it up in secret     then all the people shall say    amen          curse

be the man who do not uphold the word of the law by carry them out then all the people shall say    amen       deut 27 14 26 the new testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of reject christ be the curse    if anyone do not love the lord a curse be on him     1 corinthian 16 22 see also roman 12 19 21 hebrew 1 1 3 3 7 12 3 1519 10 26  31 12 14 29 7  how can we preach these prayer the church of jesus christ be an army under order scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the commander  in chief but we have a problem those who be call to pas on those order to others be refuse to do so how then can we expect to be a united effective army be it any wonder that the troop have lose sight of their commission to demolish the stronghold of the kingdom of darkness if the church do not hear the battle cry of her captain how will she follow him onto the battlefield pastor be commission to pas on the order of the church s commander never withholding or change his word one whose job be to carry dispatch to troop in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dare to amend the general  s order the pastor  s charge be of great importance than that of a courier in any earthly army there  s no place tor the dispatcher to decide he agree with his commander  s strategy when jesus christ sent seventy two disciple on a preach mission he told them to proclaim the come of god  s kingdom lk 10 9 that be to announce that people must submit to god s rule in their life jesus instruct them to pray for peace on any house they approach assure them that if anyone reject it the peace would return on the disciple verse 5 but we must consider what he say they should do if their message be reject that be if the hearer persist in rebellion against god  s rule    but when you enter a town and be not welcome go into it  streets and say  even the dust of your town that stick to our foot we wipe off against you yet be sure of this the kingdom of god be near    luke 10 11  what would be the result of that denunciation i tell you it will be more bearable on that day for sodom on which god sent fire from heaven in judgement for it wickedness than for that town verse 12 immediately jesus add curse on korazin bethsaida and capernaum tor their rejection of his message verse 13 15 he then explain to the disciple the great authority he have give them    he who listens to you listens to me he who reject you reject me but he who reject me reject him who sent me    verse 16 this be the fundamental basis tor call down god  s curse on anyone his persistent rebellion against god  s authority express in his law and the ministry of his servant we need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cry of the prince of peace only then will the church awake from it lethargy and once again enter the battle if we tail to pas on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the rank will be inevitable like psalm 1 our preach need to clearly show the blessing of obedience and the curse of disobedience the eternal truth be that god can not be mocked whatever a man sow that shall he reap galatian 6 7 the curse pronounce on disobedience in deut 28 47 53 be fulfil in detail in samaria 2 king 6 2 29 and in judea ad 70 the wrath of god upon covenant breaker be real the    i    of the psalm be jesus christ the    we    of the psalm include those of u

about it    first on the definition of  homosexual many group believe that there be a homosexual    orientation    i e a sexual attraction to member of the same sex this be distinguish from actual homosexual sexual activity homosexual who abstain from sex be consider by most group to be acceptable however in a lot of discussion the term  homosexual mean someone actually engage in homosexual sex this be generally not accepted outside the most  liberal group in this paper go to use  homosexual a meaning a person engage in sexual act with another of the same sex i heard of any biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate i think most people now admit that there be a predisposition to be homosexual this be often call a  homosexual orientation it be not know whether it be genetic or environmental there be evidence suggest each the best evidence see be that homosexuality be not a single phenomenon but have a number of different cause one of them be probably genetic there be several group that try to help people move from be homosexual to heterosexual the best known be exodus international    the report see and i read the detailed literature just the summary in the minority opinion to the presbyterian church  s infamous report on human sexuality suggest that these program have very low success rate and that there be question about how real even the success be but there certainly be people who say they have convert however this issue be not a important a it sound those who believe homosexuality be wrong believe it be intrinsically wrong define a such by god the fact that hard to get out of be a homosexual be no more relevant than the fact that hard to escape from be a drug addict if wrong wrong it may affect how we deal with people though if very difficult to change this may tend to make u more willing to forgive it one more general background issue common to quote a figure that 10 of the population be homosexual i ask one of our expert where this come from here  s his response kinsey see below be the source of the figure 10 percent he defines sexuality by behavior not by orientation and ranked all person on a scale from zero completely heterosexual to 6 completely heterosexual accord to kinsey one third of all male adult have have at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty ten percent of all adult male have most of their experience of homosexually that be in 1948  the percentage held true in a followup study do by the kinsey institute base on data in the early seventy but not publish until the early 80 or so by bell and weinberg i believe i put my hand on this latter reference but here be the online information for kinsey  s own study a it appear in iris the catalog at rutgers author kinsey alfred charles 1894 1956  title sexual behavior in the human male by alfred c  kinsey wardell b  pomeroy and clyde e  martin publisher philadelphia w  b  saunders co  1948  descrip xv 804 p  diagrs 24

48005195 this figure be widely use in all scholarly discussion and have even be found to hold true in several other culture a note in the recent newsweek coverstory    be this child gay    feb  24 1992 a journalist be run the round of talk show this season promote her book that allegedly refutes kinsey  s study but the scholarly world seem to take her for a kook         see some objection to the kinsey  s study but not in enough detail to include here if someone would like to contribute another view be willing to include it most christian believe homosexuality at least genital sex be wrong not all however a few denomination accept it the metropolitan community church be the best known    it be form specifically to accept homosexual however the united church of christ also allows it and i think a couple of other group may a well the episcopal church seem to accept it some area but not others in church that have congregational government find a few congregation that accept it even among southern baptist though the number be probably only one or two congregation but these be unusual    few church permit homosexual church leader how carefully they enforce this be another issue i have any doubt that there be homosexual pastor of just about every denomination some more open than others a to the argument over the biblical and other issue here  s an attempt to summarize the issue the most commonly cite reference by those favor acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussion have be john boswell    christianity social tolerance and homosexuality    u chicago press 1980  the argument against be pretty clear there be several explicit law in the ot e g leviticus 20 13 and in rom 1 paul seem pretty negative on homosexuality beyond these reference there be some debate some passage often cite on the subject probably be not relevant e g the sin which the inhabitant of sodom propose to carry out be homosexual  rape  not homosexual activity between consent adult there  s even some question whether it be homosexual since the entity involve be angel it be particularly horrify because it involve guest and the responsibility towards guest in that culture be very strong this be probably the reason lot offer his daughter    it be well to give up his daughter than to allow his guest to be attack if you look through a concordance for reference to sodom elsewhere in the bible see that few seem to imply that homosexuality be their sin there  s a jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin be abuse of guest at any rate there  s no debate that homosexual  rape  be wrong i do not discus leviticus because the law there be part of a set of law that most christian do not consider binding so unless nt justification can be found lev alone would not settle the issue the nt reference be all in paul  s letter a number of the reference from paul be list of sin in which the word be fairly vague boswell argues that the word occur in these list do not in the list i e i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 be  malakos  and  arsenokoitai  unfortunately it be not entirely clear what the word actually mean  malakos  with a basic meaning of soft have a variety of metaphorical meaning in ethical write boswell suggests    wanton    a a likely equivalent he also report that the unanimous interpretation of the church include greek speaking christian be that in this passage it refer to masturbation a meaning that have vanished only in the 20th cent  a that practice have come to be less frowned upon he cite reference a late a the 1967 edition of the catholic encyclopedia that identify it a masturbation he translates  arsenokotai  a male prostitute give evidence that none of the church father understood the term a refer to homosexuality in general a more technical meaning suggest by the early latin translation would be    active mode homosexual male prostitute    but in his view paul do not intend it so technically for a more conservative view i consult gordon fee  s commentary on i cor he cite evidence that  malakos  often meant effeminate however boswell warns u that in greek culture effeminate be not necessarily synonymous with homosexual though it may be associate with some kind of homosexual behavior give what boswell and fee say take together i suspect that the term be simply not very definite and that while it applies to homosexual in some case it a general term for homosexuality while fee argues against boswell with  arsenokotai  a well he end up suggest a translation that seem essentially the same the big problem with it be that the word be almost never use paul  s write be the first occurence the fact that the word be clearly compose of    male    and    f  k    unfortunately quite tell u the meaning since it tell u whether the male be the subject or object of the action example of compound word form either way can be give in theory it could refer to rapist etc dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology or conclude that    goodbye    be a religious expression because base on    god by with ye    however since boswell fee and niv seem to agree on    homosexual male prostitute    that seem a good a guess a any note that this translation miss the strong vulgarity of the term however something which fee and boswell agree on but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation in my opinion the strong nt reference to homosexuality be roman 1  boswell point out that rom 1 speaks of homosexuality a something that happen to people who be naturally heterosexual a a result of their corruption due to worship false god one could argue that this be simply an example that if a homosexual worship false god he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual however i find this argument somewhat force and in fact our homosexual reader have not seriously propose that this be what paul meant however i be not convince that rom 1 be sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for christian what paul be describe in rom 1 be not homosexuality among christian    homosexuality that appear among idolater a one part of a whole package of wickedness despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric sure paul do not believe that pagan completely abandon heterosexual sex give his description of their situation i rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debase and shameless so yes i do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality but in all fairness the    shameless    nature of their act be a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a specific feature of homosexuality my overall view of the situation be the follow i think we have enough evidence to be confident that paul disapprove of homosexuality rom 1 seem clear while i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 be not unambiguous and general condemnation of homosexuality they do not seem like word that would come from someone who approve of homosexuality or even consider it acceptable in some case on the other hand none of these passage contains explicit teaching on the subject rom 1 be really about idolatry it refers to homosexuality in passing the result of this situation be that people interpret these passage in light of their general approach to scripture for those who look to scripture for law about issue such a this it not surprising that they would consider these passage to be nt endorsement of the ot prohibition for those whose approach to the bible be more liberal it be not surprising that they regard paul  s negative view of homosexuality a something that he take from his jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the gospel a reader of this group know by now the assumption behind these approach be so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the oppose view described there  s not a lot i can do a moderator about such a situation a number of discussion in the past center around the sort of detailed exegesis of text that be described above however in fact not convince that defender of homosexuality actually base their own belief on such analysis the real issue seem to rest on the question of whether paul  s judgement should apply to modern homosexuality one commonly make claim be that paul have simply never face the kind of question we be try to deal with he encounter homosexuality only in context where most people would probably agree that it be wrong he have never face the experience of christian who try to act    straight    and fail and he have never face christian who be try to define a christian homosexuality which fit with general christian ideal of fidelity and of see sexuality a a mirror of the relationship between god and man it be unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexuality among idolater and use it to make judgement on these question another be the follow in paul  s time homosexuality be associate with a number of thing that christian would not find acceptable it be part of temple prostitution among private citizen it often occur between adult and child or free people and slave not in a position to say that it always do but there be some reason to think so the ancient distinguish between the active and passive partner it be consider disgraceful for a free adult to act a the passive partner this be the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be consider disgraceful his customer would all be people who enjoy the passive role this support the idea that it would tend not to be engage in between two free adult male at least not without some degree of scandal clearly christian homosexual would not condone sex with child slave or others who be not in a position to be fully responsible partner however fee  s commentary on i cor cite some example from ancient literature of homosexual relationship that do seem to involve free adult in a reasonably symmetrical way thus the consideration in this paragraph be push too far homosexuality may have be discredit for jew by some of these association but there surely must be be case that be not prostitute and do not involve slave or child some people have argue that aid be a judgement against homosexuality like to point out that aid be transmit by promiscuous sex both homosexual and heterosexual someone who have a homosexual relationship that meet christian criterion for marriage be not at risk for aid note that there be good reason from paul  s general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality a a fully equal alternative apart from any specific statement on homosexuality i believe his use of the genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage a what god ordain however the way paul deal with pastoral question provide a warn against be too quick to deal with this issue legally i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christian be not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one paul s tendency a we can see in issue such a eat meat and celebrate holiday be to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issue to look very carefully at the good of the people involve and to avoid insist on perfection when it would be personally damage for example while paul clearly believe that it be acceptable to eat meat he want u to avoid push people into do an action about which they have personal qualm for another example paul obviously would have prefer to see people at least in some circumstance remain unmarried yet if they be unable to do so he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempt to fornication i believe one could take a view like this even while accept the view paul express in rom 1  one may believe that homosexuality be not what god intend that it occur a a result of sin but still conclude that at time we have to live with it note that in the creation story work enters human life a a result of sin this mean that christian can stop work when we be save the question be whether you believe that homosexuality be in itself sinful or whether you believe that a misfortune that be in a broad sense due to human sinfulness if willing to consider the latter approach then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there be more damage cause by find a way to live with it or try to cure it the danger of try to cure it be that the attempt most often fails and when it do you end up with damage range from psychological damage to suicide a well a broken marriage when attempt at living a a heterosexual fail this be go to depend upon one  s assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality if you believe it be a very serious wrong then you may be willing to run high risk of serious damage to get rid of it clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction even though attempt to cure these condition be also very difficult however these condition be intrinsically damage in a way that be not so obvious for homosexuality many problem associate with homosexuality be actually problem of promiscuity not homosexuality this include aid i take for grant that the only sort of homosexual relationship a christian would consider allow would be equivalent to christian heterosexual relationship in the course of discuss this over the last decade or so heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow christian who be in this situation also see summary of various research and the result of various effort for    conversion    aside from the presbyterian report mention above there  s an faq that summarizes our reader report on this question the evidence be that long term success in change orientation be rare enough to be on a par with heal miracle the danger in advise christian to depend upon such a change be clear when    conversion    happen which be almost always the people be often left in despair feel exclude from a church that have nothing more to say but a requirement of life long celibacy paul recognize though in a different context that such a demand be not practical for most people and i think the history of clerical celibacy have strongly reinforce that judgement the practical result be that homosexual end up in the gay sex club and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality maybe homosexuality god  s original ideal but i can well imagine paul prefer to see people in long term commit christian relationship than promiscuity a with work    which genesis suggests part of god  s original ideal either    i think such relationship can still be a vehicle for people share god  s love with each other there  s an issue of biblical interpretation underlie this discussion the issue be that of    cultural relativism    that be when paul say that something be wrong should this be take a an eternal statement or be thing wrong because of specific situation in the culture of the time conservative christian generally insist on take prohibition a absolute since otherwise the bible becomes subjective    what be to stop u from consider everything in it a relative when look at this issue worth note that no one completely reject the concept of cultural relativism there be a number of judgement in the new testament that even conservative christian consider to be relative the follow judgement be at least a clear in the bible a anything say on homosexuality prohibition against charge interest this occurs 18 time in the ot    not in the nt but i mention it here because until relatively recently the church do consider it binding on christian prohibition against swear oath endorsement of slavery a an institution judgement of tax collector a sinner we do not regard these item a binding in most case i believe the argument be essentially one of cultural relativism briefly prohibition of interest be appropriate to a specific agrarian society that the bible be try to build but not to our market economy few people believe that american judicial oath have the same characteristic a the kind of oath jesus be concerned about most people believe that paul be simply tell people how to live within slavery but not endorse it a an institution for people believe that the irs be morally equivalent to roman tax farm the point try to make be that before apply biblical prohibition to the 20th cent  we need to look at whether the 20th cent action be the same when christian homosexual say that their relationship be different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have be familiar with this be exactly the same kind of argument that be be make about judicial oath and tax collector until fairly recently christian prohibit take of interest and many christian regard slavery a divinely endorse indeed slavery be one of the more common metaphor for the relationship between god and human being    christian be often call servant or slave of god i be not try to say that everything in the bible be culturally relative rather try to say that  some  thing be and therefore it be not enough to say that because something appear in the bible that end the discussion we need to look at whether the action talk about now have the same moral implication a the one that the bible be talk about if christian want to argue that there be reason to think that the prohibition against homosexuality be still binding willing to listen those who claim that the question need to be look at be kid themselves unless they be part of the small minority who really obey all the rule list above one thing that worry me be the great emotion that this issue creates when you consider the weakness of the biblical evidence    some law in leviticus a passage in rom whose subject matter be really idolatry rather than homosexuality and a couple of list whose word be ambiguous    the amount of concern this be raise among christian seem rather out of proportion this should suggest to people that there be reason other than simply biblical involve this be true on both side    clearly homosexual christian be a strongly motivate to find way of discredit the biblical argument a conservative christian be to find biblical argument but i help feel that the bible be be use by both side a a way of justify attitude which come from other source this be a dangerous situation for christian on the other side of the issue i would like to note some problem i have with the pro homosexual position a it be commonly present one of the most common argument be that homosexuality be biologically determine i e    god make me homosexual    and i have no choice i think    god make me homosexual    be a fine view for people who already believe on other ground that homosexuality be acceptable but i see it a an argument for acceptability

 note that    scientific evidence    in this area do not prove any conclusion there have be evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual s brain be different from heterosexuals  but that prof very little also notice that the apostle do not have with them the    scientific evidence    link certain gene with alcoholism or steal with certain genetic problem even if they do have scientific evidence i doubt it would have stop them from communicate the teach from the holy spirit that these thing be sinful this reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine he say something very true christianity teach that we should not give in to our every inclination most people do give in to their leaning in christianity we have the concept of struggle with the flesh and bring it into submission one person may have a problem with his temper and have a murderous heart another may have a problem with homosexuality another may be inclined to greed but god offer u the opportunity to be more than conquerers the prey mantis bite the head off of her mate after she mate with him be it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband the bible be concerned with human morality and only touch on animal morality a it relates to human
 i would put it strong than that i consider it nonsense simply put i do not see any way that a    platonic essence    could have any  real  existance    essence    in the platonic sense do not have any referent a far a i can tell it be just an imaginary concept invent to provide an explanation for thing well explain in other way so to attribute an  essence to god be to attribute to him something that do not exist thus the orthodox platonic formulation seem to leave the unity of god in limbo since it be base on a non existant  essence thus fail to avoid the very problem it be suppose to address thus to me the unity of god must be primary and the triality must be secondary must be modal or aspectual relate to role or to mode of interaction since otherwise there be no meaning to say god be one    sarima teradata com formerly tdatirv sarima or stanley friesen elsegundoca ncr com

 ok let me see if i can get all this out concisely i be on an information gathering venture regard the various expression of christianity churches there be my husband and i come from very different but completely christian background i be a lutheran when i met him and he be a born and raise church of christ member at first i agree with a lot of what the c of c be about i want to move from the liturgical base lutheran church to something a little more biblical base however over the last year be regret change to the church of christ for a number of reason for one thing i be not a fundamentalist and believe that a few thing in the bible be socio cultural in nature and relate to the christian doctrine one of my sorest spot be the role of woman i believe that through mary and other woman chris validate woman a worthy disciple but in the c of c the writing of paul be take without exception and i be told that i be not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member i be to submit to my husband in all thing if i hear that verse one more time     and i be not to take an active role in anything which might be construe a put me in authority over men ie lead prayer conduct bible study etc the last straw be when the elder at our church come down on one of our college group because it be all women and they want a man to lead the study also my husband and i really resent the way everyone at our church feel that if you a conservative republican you a real christian i get told that nobody who vote for clinton should call themselves a christian hence we be subject during the service to long prayer call for thing we flatly dont agree with we be also agree with the c of c  s dread of any new    movement    be lead by the young people so we have be church hunt with no success i want a reasonably biblical base church where woman be view a whole people no matter what their call c of c really look down on career woman christopher be look for a church with deeply root religious conviction with adult baptism and a church where the member still bring their bible to service we be so confuse here and drift around try to find a place where we both feel love and can express our faith honestly and without reservation if anyone can point u in a direction be thrill afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to c of c and even harder for me to stay churchless for long any response would be welcome the diel family
 ofm comment no disagreement at all that there be a very serious struggle go on but jesus more typically us consequence a a threat quite different from hell classic tm jesus sound like the usual hell fire type of preacher he attracts people through what he do and the stongest example in jesus preach be in the parable of lazarus and dive which be a parable in any case my point be that a fear based response to christ be not a free life affirming choice and good news in a meaningful sense there be plenty of good reason to follow jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal hell that still pertain to overcome in the present struggle between god and the disloyal opposition a faith base in fear be not built on rock a we should found our faith but on ice if the fear be remove there would be no foundation basically why it matter to me i think we have many christian that do n t have a solid basis for relate to the living incarnate god i can not be fully open to the work of god in and through my life if my response to god be motivate on fear larry overacker llo shell com

 it be possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision but that he interpret the scale of time and space accord to his material con  sciousness translate the supersensible perception of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context    and get it wrong not that he do it rationally but rather that unconsciously the perception become clothed in material image instead of remain in the realm of the potential and not yet time space bound this difficulty of translate prophetic vision into a concrete when and where have always be difficult even for the prophet of old that be why their prophecy be so often subject to multiple interpretation likewise the apostle seem to feel that the return of the lord be to be    very soon    in the sense of perhaps the same generation yet the meaning of    very soon    have proven to be different than they could grasp prophetic vision tends to telescope time so that thing that be far off appear to be very close another possibility be that the vision be one of a real event prepare to happen again in the realm of the potential but not yet manifest and which be thwart by other force include possibly an act of divine mercy there be many concrete prophecy be make these day by devout and sincere and sober christian and others too it seem that great come event be really cast their shadow before their arrival in these    apocalyptic    time the various prediction talk about those that appear to be sincere and sober be hard to accept yet hard to ignore com  pletely one have the feel    something be about to start to get ready to begin to commence to happen    we be living a the chinese say go in interest time a for how to discriminate the bible help much there be an old testament passage i forget where it be that say you will know whether a prophet be true by whether or not his prophecy come to pas that help eliminate the failure after the fact but in the case of an earth  quake it be small comfort it seem to me that all prophecy that give specific time and place and event should be suspect not in that they be necessarily false but in the sense state above that all such vision be subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space for what it be worth rudolf steiner once be ask whether a modern initiate could see into the future and predict come event his answer be that it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti  cipation in them include proclaim what he saw if this be in fact a spiritual law then the answer to your question about how to discriminate be that the one who make such prophecy be probably violate that law knowingly or unknowingly and a such his message should be consider a priori to be dubious i e i would expect that those capable of make true prediction and give accurate expression to them would not do so in the way that the prophet of the oregon earthquake do however i can sympathize with the person who publish the prophecy give the same overwhelm experience that he apparently have i too might feel impel and even commission by god to tell my fellow human being about what i have see gerry palo 73237 2006 compuserve com
    we however shall be innocent of this sin and will pray with earnest entreaty and supplication that the creator of all may keep unharmed the number of his elect     st  clement bishop of rome letter to the corinthian 59 2 c  90 ad    ignatius also call theophorus to the church at ephesus in asia which be worthy of all felicitation bless a it be with greatness by the fullness of god the father predestine from all eternity for a glory that be last and unchanging united and chosen in true suffer by the will of the father in jesus christ our god         st  ignatius bishop of antioch letter to the ephesian address c 110 ad    we say therefore that in substance in concept in orgin and in eminece the ancient and catholic church be alone gathering a it do into the unity of the one faith which result from the familiar covenant     those already chosen those predestine by god who knew before the foundation of the world that they would be just     st  clement patriarch and archbishop of alexandria miscellany 7 17 107 3 c 205 ad of course the doctrine be explain more fully later on by sts augustine aquinas etc  but the seed be ther from the begin i think you be reading it wrong i say those who be not save be not save on account of their own sin it be not because god do not give them sufficient grace for he do do so in his desire that all men might be save however a only some be save and those who be save be save by the grace of god    not by work l any man should boast    the others be damn because of their obstinacy in refuse to heed the call of god they be damn by their own free will and chosing a choice forseen by god in his cause them to be not predestine but reprobate instead certainly god do not distribute grace evenly if he do no one could have their heart harden or rather harden their heart thus cause god to withdraw his grace but you be correct the world be divide into those who god know to be save and those god know to be on the road to perdition the key be that god know it and we do not thus no one can boast in complete assurance that they be one of the elect and predestine but no one who be a christian in good standin should doubt their salvation either that show a lack of trust in god you must admit it be possible anyway why would you want something in the hear and know when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven well to lay up your treasure in heaven be what jesus say this be not to condemn the rich but simply to point out that those who be rich be frequently very evil or immoral so god must give them their blessing know a they have chosen remeber jesus promise tribulation in this world and hatred of others because we be christian he do not promise heaven on earth he promise heaven not really unless you do penance here on earth you will have to do it in purgatory a paul point out 1 corinthian 3 15 those with poorer work though still do with good intention will only be save through fire the damn will of course go into fire immeadiately for whatever good they do be not for god but for self dead work of course the church give indulgence have confession and annointing of the sick to remove sin and the the vestige of sin so there be really little excuse for end up in purgatory it be a last hope for the somewhat lazy and careless a i say above in refer to paul and no comment be take a flame you be one of the more polite people i have talk to over the net andy byler
 fine but one of the point of this entire discussion be that    we    conservative reform christian this could start an argument     but this idea that homosexuality be ok fairly    new    this century be there any support for this be a viable viewpoint before this century i know believe that homosexuality be    acceptable to him    so your scripture quotation work for    u
 do he believe in predestination really you may be right but like proof a far a i know and i be not a div school student the catholic church do not seem to accept predestination my chaplain told me    beware of greek bearing gift    with reference to this doctrine it seem to have the curious result that human being be not held responsible for their own action answer how you deal with this in a minute right that really seem like predestination to me but continue with what say     this be really confuse to me especially since i still believe that christ jesus die for all of u preknowledge of obstinacy seem like an awfully convolute way to account for a couple of verse but then i be not really biblically support in this opinion    or be i others so god us grace like margarine he only spread it where need and not where it and so there be the save and the not saved and nothing in between hmmmm although i realize this doctrine be not originally intend to cause social problem it end up do just that    if there be suppose to be some sort of    sign    that someone be elect like lot of child or success at work then those who have a good life on earth will go around think that those who be doom to hell in a way though this sound like the opposite idea    those doom to hell will have a great life on earth almost like the converse of what i believe    responsibility for what we do now will be punish after we die say what we get after we die have a direct bearing on how we live now strange     so sin be either punish now or later    and not both what if sort of half punished be there any grey area in this doctrine my stuff delete we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverb 24 11 12 but do that mean that christian should support a war in bosnia with the u s or even the u n  involve i do not think so but i be an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventure in general but in the case of bosnia i frankly see no excuse for u get militarily involve it would not be a    just war       bless    after all    be the peacemaker    be what our lord say not the interventionists our action in bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which be unrelated to anything to justify it for u the idea well my idea would be that you would intervene to establish peace and stop the atrocity not suggest wwiii i really understand what you mean by a    just war    of course i be not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jumping in at the first opportunity can you say kuwait we happen to be a big country with a lot of resource a well a a lot of debt and this give u some responsibility in the world whether we like it or not flashback of wwii a well a vietnam should be haunt u yet another difference of opinion so be it andy byler thank you for answer i hope you take any of my comment a flame but instead a expression of interest

 i have not see this book though i have have several people quote it in support of some tendentious assertion they be make so i have become curious about it i want to malign this hislop fellow whoever he may be a i have only heard the argument at second hand but both of the argument seem to turn on false etymology that seem to be derive from hislop i would be interested in know more about these thing the first one claimed that the word    church    be derive from the greek    cyclos    and that it be therefore related to the worship of    circe    i know if hislop be the source of this assertion but it do seem to be base on false etymology the second claimed an etymological relationship between    ishtar    and    easter    which seem to be even more fanciful and far fetched than some of the wilder notion of the british israelite regard the latter a far a i have be able to find out    easter    be derive from the old english name for april    eosturmonath    the venerable bede mention that this be associate with a goddess call    eostre    but apart from that reference i have not be able to find out anything more about her it also seem that the term    easter    be only use by the english and those they evangelize the german for example also use the term    ostern    but germany be evangelize by english missionary so i would be interested in any evidence of    easter    be use for pascha by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient anglo  saxon and their offshoot such evidence might support the claim of those who appear to derive the theory from hislop
 i would like to see his reason behind this you may have gotten    burn    by natural disaster prophecy down there but that do not mean that every natural disaster judgement prophecy be false take a quick look at the book of jeremiah and it be obvious that judgement prophecy can be valid here in the u it seem like we might have more of a problem with positive prophecy though i be sure there may be a few people who be too into judgement sometimes god do give word that be difficult to swallow the relative positiveness of a prophecy be not necesarily ground to dismiss it much of the ot be not happy stuff

 from dhammers pacific  david hammerslag how do you mormon reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ  s statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be give in marriage luke chapt 20 footnote in some bible reference this verse to the book of tobit tobit be in the septuagint goodspeed publish it in a book call    the apocrypha    most any bookstore will have this at any rate the jew of christ  s day have this book it be a story mostly center around the son of tobit who be name tobias there be a young lady sarah who have enter the bridal chamber with seven brother in succession the brother all die in the chamber before consumating the marriage tobias be entitle to have sarah for his wife 3 17 because tobias be her only relative and        she be destine for tobias from the begin    6 17 tobias take her to wife and be able to consumate the marriage the seven husband would not have her a a partner in heaven that do not eliminate tobias her eighth husband tobit be a fun and interest story to read kind of a mythical romance a little shorter than esther the lds also have scripture that parallel and amplify luke 20  most notably doctrine and covenant 132 15 16    therefore if a man marry him a wife in the world and he marry her not by me nor by my word and he covenant with her so long a he be in the world and she with him their covenant and marriage be not of force when they be dead and when they be out of the world therefore they be not bound by any law when they be out of the world    therefore when they be out of the world they neither marry nor be give in marriage but be appoint angel in heaven which angel be minister servant to minister for those who be worthy of a far more and an exceed and an eternal weight of glory
    hate the sin but love the sinner        heard that quite a bit recently often in the context of discussion about christianity and homosexuality     but the context really that important my question be whether that statement be consistent with christianity i would think not hate begets more hate never love consider some sin i  ll leave it unnamed since i want this to digress into an argument a to whether or not something be a sin now let apply our    hate the sin        philosophy and see what happens if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the strong our hatred of it will become eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgust with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner in addition our hatred of the sin often cause u to say and do thing which be take personally by the sinner who often do not even believe what they be do be a sin after enough of this the sinner begin to hate u they certainly love u for our constant criticism of their behavior hate build up and drive people away from god     this certainly can not be a good way to build love in the summary of the law christ command u to love god and to love our neighbor he say anything about hate in fact if anything he command u to save our criticism for ourselves so how be christian suppose to deal with the sin of others i suppose that there be only one way to deal with sin either in others or ourselves     through prayer we need to ask god to help u with our own sin and to help those we love with theirs only love can conquer sin     hatred have no place the best way to love someone be to pray for them scott

 subject hate the sin     date 12 may 93 08 27 08 gmt    hate the sin but love the sinner        heard that quite a bit recently my question be whether that statement be consistent with christianity i would think not hate begets more hate never love if you be question whether or not    hat sin    be consistent with christianity i ask you to consider the follow scripture roman 12 9    let love be without hypocrisy hate what be evil cling to what be good    what be it that paul through the inspiration of the holy spirit be call u to hate would god call u to do something that would eventually lead to hat our fellow man especially when he command u to do the opposite to love your fellow man consider some sin now let apply our    hate the sin        philosophy and see what happens if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the strong our hatred of it will become eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgust with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner that have not be my experience not found myself hat anybody a a result of hat the sin that may be in their life a a sinner myself i find myself have more compassion for the person jesus too since the bible teach that he be tempt in every way that we be be able to have compassion on u when we our tempt and fall jesus be our very example of how to hate the sin but love the sinner in the account of the woman caught in adultery john 8 jesus have compassion on the woman but he also call her to leave her life of sin this be what it mean to love sinner but hate their sin it mean love them unconditionally while at the same time call them to leave their sin in addition our hatred of the sin often cause u to say and do thing which be take personally by the sinner who often do not even believe what they be do be a sin the blame for this can not always be laid at the foot of the christian i have see and be guilty of take offense by someone merely point out my sin and call me to repent of it it be not unloving for the christian to call me out of sin in fact i believe it be the most love thing that that person could have do he love me enough to want to spare me the consequence of remain in my sin after enough of this the sinner begin to hate u they certainly love u for our constant criticism of their behavior hate build up and drive people away from god     this certainly can not be a good way to build love again i think that you can lay the blame for this at the foot of the christian if we have love them a jesus love sinner exemplify in john 8 and the sinner hate u for it then we have do the best we can we will have extend to them the most perfect expression of love and they will have reject it now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner then indeed we will ourselves be in sin in the summary of the law christ command u to love god and to love our neighbor he say anything about hate i would like to encourage you to do a word study on hate in the new testament i really think that you will be surprised in fact if anything he command u to save our criticism for ourselves criticism be very different from call a sinner to repent hope this help in christ tony balsamo

 yes i suppose true of course notice i qualify with nearly every language and there be missionary out there who can speak every imaginable language and dialect but then the fact that not all language have a write gospel lends no credence to the concept of    pentecost    type xenoglossolalia since most tongue occur not in these place of un written language but rather in church full of people who do have a write language and a bible in that language
 until recently i always understood the term    kingdom theology    to mean the theology of the kingdom of god but now i have discover that there be a new and more specialized meaning i gather that it be also call    dominion theology    and that it have to do with a belief that christian must create a theocratic form of government on earth before christ will come again i have not come across anyone who believe or advocate this but i be told that it be a very widespread belief in the usa can anyone give me any more information about it here be some of my question 1  be it the teach of any particular denomination if so which 2  where and when do it start 3  be there any particular publication that propagate it 4  be there any organization that propagate it
 for your first set of question regard the energy and will of christ i quote to you the relevant part of the statement sign by both eastern chalcedonian and oriental non chalcedonian orthodox scholar a few year ago both family both orthodox church 1  both family agree in condemn the eutychian heresy both family confess that the logo the second person of the holy trinity only begotten of the father before the age and consubstantial with him be incarnate and be born from the virgin mary theotokos fully consubstantial with u perfect man with soul body and mind   nu o   upsilon   zeta he be crucify die be bury and rise from the dead on the third day ascend to the heavenly father where he sits on the right hand of the father a lord of all creation at pentecost by the come of the holy spirit he manifest the church a his body we look forward to his come again in the fullness of his glory accord to the scripture 2  both family condemn the nestorian heresy and the crypto nestorianism of theodoret of cyrus they agree that it be not sufficient merely to say that christ be consubstantial both with his father and with u by nature god and by nature man it be necessary to affirm also that the logo who be by nature god become by nature man by his incarnation in the fullness of time 3  both family agree that the hypostasis of the logo become composite by unite to his divine uncreated nature with it natural will and energy which he have in common with the father and the holy spirit create human nature which he assume at the incarnation and make his own with it natural will and energy 4  both family agree that the nature with their proper energy and will                                                                             be united hypostatically and naturally without confusion without change                                                                                without division and without separation and that they be distinguish in                                                                                thought alone               5  both family agree that he who will and act be always the one hypostasis of the logo incarnate     i guess that adresses your question adequately a for your second set of question i be afraid they be irrelevant to the discussion at least from my point of view of monophysitism i do not see how they relate to the topic we be discuss other than to start an endless orthodox rc debate which i do not plan to engage into a a brief answer to your question the position of the coptic orthodox church regard the roman pontiff his jurisdiction his infalability etc be exactly the same a all the other orthodox church peace nabil
 in the course of discuss the sabbath with some folk i come across something that be completely new to me and i thought offer it for comment to keep this a brief a possible let me state my observation a a declarative statement and then whoever want to can comment on it basically what i think observe be that the phrase    the ten commandment    a use by moses be not a reference to ex 20 1 17 but rather a reference to ten distinct discourse from ex 20 1 through ex 31 18  that be the phrase    the ten commandment    should more accurately be translate    the ten discourse    of which the passage we call the    ten commandment    be really only the first not completely convince that the above be true but for purpose of discussion let me argue it a though i be sure argument support the above idea 1 there really ten commandment in ex 20 1 17  in order to get 10 commandment you have to get two of them out of verse 3 6 and the verse themselves do not support such a division because they be all about not worship other god that be verse 3 command to have no other god and verse 5 command to not worship the idol mention in verse 4  you violate verse 5 6 without violate verse 3 indicate that the whole passage be one command and leave u with only nine    commandment    i could go on at length about this but for now i  ll just stop with this summary 2 there be ten speech between ex 20 1 the begin of the traditional    ten commandment    and ex 31 18 where god actually give moses the two tablet with the ten commandments discourses write on them i break these ten down a follow 20 1 17 20 22 26 21 1 23 33 25 1 30 10 30 11 16 30 17 21 30 22 33 30 34 38 31 1 11 and 31 12 18  in most case each of these passage begin with some variation of the phrase    and the lord spoke to moses say        the exception be ex 21 1 which begin    now these be the ordinance which you be to set before them        3 the word translate    commandment    in the phrase    the ten commandment    really the word for    commandment    it the word for a speech or an utterance a word often use for longer discourse rather than individual statement for instance when combine with the word  yom day this word be translate    chronicle    in such phrase a    now the rest of the act of so and so be they not write in the chronicle of x        the word for    commandment    be freely use throughout the book of moses and perhaps it be significant that when moses spoke of the ten x  s he appear to have avoid the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associate with discourse longer than just a single command 4 god tell moses that he be go to give him the stone tablet    with the law and the commandment    ex 24 12 yet he do not give moses the tablet until he have finish all ten discourse on mount sinai if the ten commandment be only ex 20 1 17 it be not immediately clear why god would wait several day and nine more discourse before give these tablet to moses on the other hand if we have the ten discourse write on the tablet then it make perfect sense that god would not give moses the tablet until he have finish deliver all ten discourse 5 when moses do get the tablet he found that both tablet be write on both side ex 32 15 if these ten    commandment    be only the first 17 verse of ex 20 god would have have to have write in large letter not that he have of course but it do seem more likely to me that this be a reference to two tablet contain ten discourse write in normal  size letter 6 in ii cor 3 paul seem to specifically single out the    commandment write on stone    a be the    ministry of death       that which be fading away    and    the ministry of condemnation    with the possible exception of the commandment about the sabbath it be difficult to see why paul would refer to the command in ex 20 1 17 a be temporary    fading away     type commandment this be less of a problem if the stone tablet should happen to have include all of the commandment from ex 20 through ex 31  argument against this idea the main argument against this idea aside from the fact that it contradicts a long standing tradition be that in dt 5 22 moses say after quote the command in ex 20 1 17    these word the lord spoke     and he add no more and he write them on two tablet of stone and give them to me    this appear to identify the word just quote a be the only content of the two stone tablet that be my first impression anyway however after some thought i note that a great deal hinge on how you understand the phrase    these word    if moses meant    these word  which i have just related to you  be spoken by god    etc  then that would mean that only the traditional    ten commandment    be on the stone tablet if however moses be make a parenthetical comment       these word  which i be now tell you  be spoken by god    etc     then quite different i do note that in the dt 5 account moses tell of be give the stone tablet before tell of the people ask moses to represent them before god whereas in the exodus account the people ask this of moses between the first and second discourse several day before god give moses the stone tablet this reinforces the idea that moses remark in dt 5 22ff be intend a a parenthetical remark rather than a strictly chronological account of when god write what and at what point he stop add to what be on the tablet summary all thing consider i find it somewhat more likely that the nine command in ex 20 be really only the first of what moses regard a the ten discourse of god i know if anybody have ever espouse this idea before brand new to me so while i lean towards accept it i would be very interested in hearing any comment and criticism anyone may care to offer
 my stuff about deal with defferences delete i be sorry i do not mean to i think i understand how your experience be much bad than the small bit of ridicule i have have to put up with i guess i really understand before now i do wow pretty conservative church please excuse me if this seem like a ridiculous understatement to you on a side note that    under god    in there until recently    i believe my father who be in his sixty remembers say the pledge of allegiance without that in there i know the history behind that though emotional blackmail    ouch thank goodness be neutral in my thanks here i be raise in a completely tolerant household so that i could make my own decision so atheism have to be taught but christianity do i guess i can see that although i can see a child believe in some sort of god without anything other than his  her own imagination a a basis sorry i guess this be sort of minor my query about parallel between lack of choice for homosexual and lack of choice for him a an atheist delete hmm i wonder why i be a christian then this a flame this be a real wonder do anyone else have opinion to offer on why you believe in something that necessarily be    proven    to you sound like you be an atheist by nature then or be it possible that at least part of it be due to the apparently repressive nature of the christianity of your childhood if this be get too personal perhaps you should ignore it or we can take it to email this may have be a general remark you do not sound broken to me but indeed strong yes i agree with that see some of the damage repressive religion can do and a a result i intend to raise my own child a much a i can to look around before accept one religious stand atheism be include in this and to _question everything_    this be very important i can see that
 after reading this story about st  maria goretti post two week ago i be a bit confuse while it be clear that her daily life be one of probity and sanctity i be afraid i quite understand the final episode of her life i be reading it correctly she and the church apparently felt that be rap be a sin on _her_ part one so perfidious that she would rather die than commit it if this be the case afraid that i disagree rather strongly can anyone out there explain this one to me yours in christ
 often time most recently on this list in the last few day heard the passage from revelation        whoever add to the sacred word of this book     whoever remove word from this book        use a an arguement against the deutercanonical book i feel this be ridiculous for two reason 1  they add later by the catholic church they be  always  part of what be consider inspire scripture this have be dealt with in previous posting     no reason to repeat the info 2  it be more likely than not that when st  john or whomever write the book of revelation what be then consider scripture be    not    the same thing you and i be hold in our hand if one take the translation of    this book    in rev 18 22 or somewhere around there to mean    all of scripture    then all of u be likely hold something that be in violation of this command it be impossible to exactly date the scripture even the n t one they like to date their letter i guess i really wish i have my bible with me right now to get the fact straight but i believe that several of the n t letter chief among them 2 peter have their most likely date of composition in the early second century a d  revelation be almost certainly write durin the reign of domition sp a d  80 96  thus it could be argues that we be all in sin if we accept 2 peter a scripture since it be    add    to the book after the composition of revelation when we be told to add nothing more
 the catholic church have an entirely different view of mary than do    most    other christian church those with parallel belief notwithstanding christ by most account be the only sinless person to ever live i too have trouble with a sinless mary concept just a for the related issue of the    original    sin only adam and eve will answer for that one my child do not answer for my sin certainly i only answer for mine
 i see how this logically follow true enough mary receive a blessing beyond any grant in all the history of humanity by be privileged to be the mother of the savior it say nothing about mary need to be a    bless person    _first_ in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the son of god again i think the problem be that a human we comprehend how the sinless incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and god  s spirit rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of god we must need try to dope out a mechanism or rationale a to how this could be mary  s own word        my spirit rejoices in god _my savior_ for he have regard the low estate of his handmaiden        sound like the word of a human aware of her own humanity in need of a savior similar to what david proclaim in his psalm     not the word of a holy be with no far need for god  s grace i really apologize for harp on this i suppose important just that i see mary and joseph and the baby reduce to placid serene figurine i feel we lose the wonder in the fact that god chose to come down to you and i to be born of people like you and i to share our existence and redeem u from fallenness by his holy incarnation
 i know either truth be know so little be know of angel to even guess all we really know be that angel always speak in the nativ tongue of the person talk to so perhaps they have any language of their own well we be told to test the spirit while you could do this scripturally to see if someone claim be back by the bible i see nothing wrong with make sure that that guy lazarus really be dead and now alive a common fallacy you commit the non falsifiability trick how can i prove it when not all the evidence may be see answer i the fallacy be in assume that it be up to me to prove anything when i say it have never be proven talk about the one make the claim not the skeptic who be do the prove the burden of proof rest with the claimant unfortunately pontification warn our legal system seem to be head in the dangerous realm of make people prove their innocence end pontification but truthfully corinthian be so poorly write or maybe just so poorly translate into english that much remains unknown about just what paul really intend despite claim of hard proof one way or another some will see his writing in 1 cor 12 14 a say do this do this and use sarcasm metaphor etc while yet others take what he say literally sarcasm and metaphor notwithstanding
 continue with dr  deyoung  s article  survey of new interpretation of arsenokoitai d s bailey d s bailey be perhaps the trailblazer of new assessment of the meaning of arsenokoitai he take the term in i cor 6 9 a denote male who actively engage in homosexual act in contrast to malakoi    effeminate    those who engage passively in such act  4 however he insists that paul knew nothing of    inversion a an inherit trait or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular cause and consequently regard all homosexual practice a evidence of perversion    38 hence bailey limit the term s reference in paul  s work to act alone and lament modern translation of the term a    homosexual    bailey want to distinguish between    the homosexual  condition  which be morally neutral and homosexual  practices     italic in source paul be precise in his terminology and moffatt  s translation    sodomite    best represent paul  s meaning in bailey  s judgment 39 bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition be know by biblical writer j  boswell the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary author be that of john boswell  5 whereas the usual translation 6 of this term give it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense boswell give it a passive sense in an extend discussion of the term 341 53 he cite    linguistic evidence and common sense    to support his conclusion that the word mean    male sexual agent i e active male prostitute    his argument be that the arseno  part of the word be adjectival not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity hence the term accord to boswell designates a male sexual person or male prostitute he acknowledges however that most interpret the composite term a active meaning    those who sleep with make their bed with men    boswell base his interpretation on linguistics and the historical set he argues that in some compound such a paidomathes    child learner    the paido  be the subject of manthano and in others such a paidoporos    through which a child pass    the paido  be neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance his point be that each compound must be individually analyze for it meaning more directly he maintains that compound with the attic form arreno  employ it objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno  use it a an adjective 343 yet he admits exception to this distinction regard arreno  boswell next appeal to the latin of the time namely drauci or exoleti these be male prostitute have men or woman a their object the greek arsenokoitai be the equivalent of the latin drauci the correspond passive would be parakoitai    one who lie beside    boswell affirms he claim that arsenokoitai be the    most explicit word available to paul for a male prostitute    since by paul  s time the attic word porno    fornicator    and porneuon    one commit fornication    found also in the lxx have be adopt    to refer to men who resort to female prostitute or simply commit fornication     7 in the absence of the term from pagan writer such a herodotus plato aristotle and plutarch and from the jewish writer philo and josephus boswell find even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai    do not connote  homosexual or even  sodomite in the time of paul    346  8 he also demonstrates it absence in pseudo lucian sextus empiricus and libanius he subsequently find it lack in    all discussion of homosexual relation    346  9 among christian source in greek include the didache tatian justin martyr eusebius  10 clement of alexandria gregory of nyssa and john chrysostom chrysostom be single out for his omission a    final proof    that the word could not mean homosexuality  11 boswell next appeal to the omission of the text of i cor and i tim from discussion of homosexuality among latin church father 348  12 cite be tertullian arnobius lactantius and augustine the last name us    circumlocution    other latin writer include ausonius cyprian and minucius felix the term be also lack in state and in church legislation by the sixth century the term become confuse and be apply to a variety of sexual activity from child molest to anal intercourse between a husband and wife 353 have survey the source boswell concludes there be no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connote homosexuality in the time of paul or for century thereafter and every reason to suppose that whatever they come to mean they be not determinative of christian opinion on the morality of homosexual act 353 it be clear throughout that boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitute he even go so far a to conclude that paul would probably not disapprove of    gay inclination       gay relationship       endure love between person of the same gender    or    same sex eroticism    112 166 17 ________________________________________________________ 4  d s bailey

 consequently this verse indicates that she be without sin also a be observe at the very top of this post mary have to be free from sin in order to be the mother of jesus who be definitely without sin if the mother of jesus have to be without sin in order to give birth to god then why mary  s mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for jesus for that matter why mary  s grandmother have to be without sin either seem to me that with all the original sin flow through each person the need for the last one mary to have none put god in a box where we say that he have incarnate himself through a normal human be my god be an all powerful god who can do whatever suit his purpose this include create a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age provide a path through the red sea for the child of israel that do not depend on the existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the right speed and direction and the birth of himself from a normal sinful person without be taint by her original sin i see far too much focus on the    object    of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that be available to all believer with the author of our existence without the necessity of have this relationship channel through conduit to god in the form of mary apostle and a pope note that the idea of mary be conceive without original sin i e the immaculate conception be distinct from the idea of mary not have sin during her lifetime which be a separate doctrine and i believe also held by the catholic church if mary be born without original sin and sin during her lifetime how be she any different from jesus this mean the world have have two perfect human one die to take away the sin of the world the other give birth to him i would certainly want to see some scriptural support for this before i would start pray to anyone other than god everything i have ever read from the bible teach me that jesus be and be the only sinless lamb of god not his mother grandmother            hope this be useful to you very useful in help me understand some of the rc belief thank you
 whitsebd nextwork rose hulman edu bryan whitsell writes but that be exactly what i be ask if the homosexual community be that the proper term have decide that christianity be not against homosexual behaviour but rather condones it then how do they interpret these verse i guess what i be really look for be a    homosexual    response
 i hate to sound flippant have shot off my mouth badly on the net before but afraid that much of this material only add to my feel that    the assumption of mary    would be well phrase    our assumption _about_ mary    in all the time be reading about mary on this group i can not recall reading much about mary that do not sound like wishful veneration with scant if any scriptural foundation i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ  s parent a compellingly human person to be honor and admire for their humility and submission to god  s work beyond doubt but the almalga  mation of theory and dogma that have accrete around them give me an image of alien and inhuman creature untouched by sin or human desire only christ himself be so truly sanctify and even he knew temptation albeit without submit to it i also see the _necessity_ of say the holy parent be some  how sanctify beyond normal humanity it sound like our own inability to grasp the immensity of god  s grace in be incarnate through an or  dinary human be i start yell about how people be    worship    mary etc  since folk have told me otherwise about that but i do think we lose part of the wonder of god  s incarnation in christ when we make his parent out to be sinless sexless deathless otherworldly being
 it be important if christianity be be damage by it if people who    speak in tongue    make claim that they be miraculously speak a foreign language through the power of the holy spirit when it can easily be show that they be simply make noise it damage all christian since many who be not christian do not distinguish between the various sect the more modest claim for    tongue    that it be simply uncontrolled praise in which    word fail you    be surely the one that should be use by those who make use of this practice i agree with the point that    charismatic    practice like this can lead to form of worship which be more about the worshipper show off than genuine praise for god one of the thing jesus warn u about
 no smiley on the part about atheism i see do you realize that your statement say that i be mention    nonsense    about atheism this be hard for me to defend against if this be the claim you be make a you have only include the last two sentence of my post and mention the first please address the substance of my post rather than reject it out of hand but because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of english i may be misinterpret your word here please clarify do you or do you not mean to call my statement about atheism    nonsense    if so care to back up that claim ok then start up the amatuer psycology again how be i    broken     yawn  excuse me i recall any portion of my post in which i call christian arrogant quote me if i do i do remember call christianity    silly    and then follow that up with information that i be nine year old when i thought that i also say that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest and i would like to see some sort of proof of your god s existence i define    faith    a    belief in the absense of any proof    btw also i subscribe to a a a i mention and we see fundies of all type there so in answer to your question    no    finally hardly call christianity    beseiged    in this country i seldom see christian ridicule for merely practise their religion or wear cross or have christian bumper sticker i know for sure of course i only say i see it happen what i have see happen be my homosexual and or friend be beat up or preach at by people who claim to be christ  s follower i know that this sort of thing practice by the majority of christian but it be a very vocal minority who be do it and i see comperable victimization of christian the implication be that i be not self respecting of course not a student of psychology btw but i be a student of creative write and linguistics so literary analysis _is_ my forte also if the implication i see be improper please let me know here because not sequester in my own little atheist cubbyhole a you seem to think atheist should be do it occur to you that i __ think i know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life have you read my other post here or do you see    atheist    and decide it be time to poke at someone who deserve your respect aw geez sorry i probably be get my back up a little too high here just that the    nonsense    thing really annoys me i figure you should see my first reaction though since they be my true reaction to your question now the smooth feather version i seek all sort of knowledge why i come to my university yes i be look at your religion well sorta i have no idea what  kind  of christian you be from the outside and hopefully with an objective view be try to ask reason question here because i genuinely know the answer to them but when i saw the question direct at atheist i figure i would answer after all you can speculate about atheist motif here all you want hence the    amatuer    psychology crack but without an atheist you be sure of even one atheist  s motive hop people really want to know and i be try to show that i actually checked out several religion and i actually read all the pamphlet people have to offer and i actually think about these thing instead still face with the implication that atheism be some kind of aberration and that only    broken    people be atheist try it from the flip side i posit that atheism be the natural state and only broken people be theist i offer a proof that so many people witness from horrible life which picked up a soon a they discover their religion that religion be regional if people follow the religion of their area there would be a more homogenous mix so many terrorist claim theistic motif and that theist tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt atheism why be religion so successful because there be so much suffer in the world which    break    people an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it which be another reason here to try to see the flip side of my think and also a a watchdog for logical fallacy                                                the implication here be that atheist possibly know anything about christianity probably jumping at shadow again but i think my reaction be somewhat justified after all the first post suggest that atheist be    broken    hostile people this post confirms that someone else believe it            well he get me there i be a strong atheist because i feel that lack of evidence especially about something like an omnipotent be implies lack of existence however i met the strong atheist yet who say that nothing could ever persuade him call me a    seeker    if you like i _weak_ atheism be be ignore here though some atheist simply say    i believe in any god    rather than my position    i believe that no god s exist    for the weak atheist the be no atheism to disbelieve because they actively believe in atheism if you think this be confuse try figure out the difference between protestant and methodist from an atheist point of view this be another fallacy many theist seem to have that everyone believe in something follow up by    everyone have faith in something    guess what my atheism end the moment show a proof of some god  s existence be that really too much to ask well i guess you succeed in convert him or me why the supposition that you will fail to convince him amatuer psycology on be it because you yourself be unconvinced and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest note that i can only speak for myself if you find faith to be honest show me how i have be unable to reconcile it so far maybe how    broken    i tell you that i have invisible fairy living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it if you accept that you be of a fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you think all i ask for be proof of the assertion    god exists    logical or physical proof only please then discus the nature of    god    prayer uh oh have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie good luck to you a well and again i apologize if the inference i make be inaccurate muppets and garlic toast forever max bob muir

 this be mislead at best the question really have to do with the status of the greek septuagint versus hebrew scripture and the issue predates the reformation by quite a bit    jerome be negative about the    deuteroncanonicals    and in fact even though he transalted them he put them after the hebrew canon reorder from the greek order to the hebrew one his translation of them be quick and dirty also he report have do one of them in one day and another overnight just dictate his translation to an amanuensis that be to say it be the vulgate and all of it massive importance in western christianity along with the veneration of jerome which take the first step in    reduce    these book from the status they have and have among the greek furthermore it be inaccurate to say that the reformer    threw out    these book basically they just place them in a secondary status a jerome have already do but with the additional warn that doctrine should not be base on citation from these alone i think that the emphasis on the hebrew original be sound though it seem somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation a part of a collection whose principle of selection in hebrew or greek be confuse or unknown and likely fraught with accident it also seem to play into a tendentious notion of the original language be somehow    more inspire       a if magical and convey a message untranslatable    than a translation a if we could not hear god  s word to the jew in greek or german or english     this tendency seem to have get a big boost in _sola scriptura_ protestantism even to the point of current    inerrancy    bizarreness despite the more basic underlie tendency of the reformer to see that the text should and could be translate if we can profit from an english render of hebrew and greek there be surely little reason to keep sirach at least out of our bible and of course anglican do so for text originally in greek it would seem more to be anti greek prejudice notably by the time the hebrew canon be fully attest include anti christian prejudice which lead to the jewish abandonment of the septuagint which be operative btw reader may enjoy some lecture of bruce metzger on the issue of translation of the bible include some of what i say about jerome above in the current number of the journal _bibliotheca sacra_ two of four have be publish so far
 i would like to hear from people who be think of go to the urbana 93 conference in december this year i have recently receive info from ifes international fellowship of evangelical student and be think about attend although i be still not sure whether i can afford it i would also like to hear from people involve in ifes or ivf group just to hear how thing be go on your campus be there any news group or group of people who already do this i be involve in the christian fellowship at the university of technology sydney in australia if you be interested to find out how we be go mail me to find out
 i agree with the exception that i preach ignore our culture in revelation 2 3 we see that in the first century church there be one congregation in each major city so there be one unified church now in each city there be people of different culture naturally they form something of a stew with different member have different heritage nevertheless they be one body they met together sometimes a small group in their home and sometimes in big group in place such a the temple court now in a particular city then and now you will find that there be a common language associate with that region for instance in rome latin be spoken in the united state today english be spoken so it would make sense that congregation in different city would speak the common language and not necessarily latin naturally you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language in the first century church there be probably many people in the congregation who could speak a give tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic group today however you see people speak in tongue to translate sermon even in so called pentacostal church we do have a modern day equivalent though    bi lingual speaker now in the unified church of which i be a member sometimes call the international church of christ when we all meet together on sunday there be headphone on people who speak english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue neat idea huh now we meet in different size group in a random sort of way on sunday so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitian or of spanish  speak people for example who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language in addition we meet in small group a couple of time during the week for bible discussion group and devotional so someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language assume the congregation be large enough for those meeting a for the people who speak the common language they can keep in touch with their culture if they want but they will also have equally deep friendship among their church relationship with people of many various nationality the action of let catholic worship in a native language instead of latin indeed not see my second paragraph in response to the second clip of your article however if you mean the action of form denomination base on a culture then the purpose of the church have be indeed thwart i  ll assume the second possiblility when answer your next clip you have met some need of people certainly by help them to be proud of their cultural heritage when most denomination yet you have largely isolated yourselves from have quality    christian    friendship outside your nationality and your denomination we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage however we will do this in a way that do not destroy church unity but rather encourages friendship among all disciple it sound like these group have wonderful intention but they be go about thing in the wrong way and name like the african methodist episcopal church still make me cringe although not a much a before i understand that there be more racism in the past that cause such group to be form but now we should try to unite i know that hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there be only one body of people on earth but it be quite possible and i be work to make it happen however what might be a small step towards unity would be take the word    african    out of your denomination  s name then perhaps someday a long time off you can also remove the    methodist episcopal    part also and simply be part of    the church    there shall be one church for the sake of unity and it shall be useful in help student new to america make the transition in culture language and thought we make a new denomination to try to solve problem the whole denominational mindset only cause more problem sadly thank you for the invitation that show me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of jesus a well a take part in your cultural heritage thank you also for respond to my post i know all too well how they can be very time consuming the whole idea of celebrate your culture be pave with good intention but i still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time my own church the boston church have the acapella sing that you mention in your post yet limit expression of my mexican culture even though i be in the mit campus ministry and not the spanish speak zone i have make a commitment to god that i will go to the sunday service of my church because i know that my brother and sister here be fully devote in love for god a his disciple i believe in tongue a you may have already picked up on because of my understand of biblical christianity however i be certainly willing to visit your congregation provide that it interfere with my normal worship since you also live in cambridge i also extend an invitation to you to visit our service a often a you like you can meet the mit student at the student center across from 77 mass ave  at 9am on sunday to leave for worship or simply call me after wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day my number be 225 7598 but will be 354 1357 in a few week

 woo so far have the follow interpretation of the figure of the whore of babylon in rev 17 18 a the united state of america b mho db which be a a figure of the fall spiritual power who corrupt and oppress human society c historical jerusalem d historical rome dare i suggest that the passage might be many layer in meaning how about the prophecy reveals god  s judgement on the corrupt idolatrous state oppress his chosen people d that god  s judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city c because despite that city s special call it still reject god  s grace at the decisive time rev 11 8 also rev19 24 equally suggestive of rome a jerusalem that the usofa be guilty of many of the crime of rome babylon a and be equally subject to god  s judgement that the good book tm actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoint by reveal the corrupt spiritual power war against mankind through the very society that create b clever huh    flame here no need to argue at all i think mary  s view have a lot of sense because there seem to be a deliberate contrast between rev 17 18 and rev 21 22 the mortal jerusalem chosen by god but never historically fulfil it vocation and the new jerusalem perfect outside of history purely by god s grace eg detail like rev 17 1    who sits on many water cf rev 22 the single stream in the new jersualem the river of life flow from the throne of god and of the lamb

 i define faith a    belief in the abscense sp of evidence    i also include in    evidence    past experience because i have no past experience in a god actually have an effect on my life and because i have never see evidence for any god beyond what can be explain without the neccessity of a god or which be more convincing than the many fictional work i have read and other reason i do not believe in any god s from what i have see some people reconcile this lack of evidence by use faith it be faith in that sense the only way i _currently_ understand the word    faith    that i find intellectually dishonest pascal  s wager go something like this premise 1 either there be or there a god premise 2 if god exists he want u to believe and will damn u for not believe premise 3 if god do not exist then belief in god matter because death be death anyway conclusion belief in god be superior to non belief because non belief damn u to eternal punishment if we be wrong while belief in god only waste a little time in life if we be wrong sound pretty straightforward and be logically sound the problem be premise 1 presupposes 1 1 odds between belief and non belief this be flat out wrong because of the sheer number of religion out there and the fact that for the most part the religion be mutually exclusive i have heard theist refer to a    99 atheist    because they believe in their god or god to be the _one_ god or set of god the consequence of this be    what if i pick the wrong god    suddenly the odds look so good because pick the wrong god or wrong doctrine of a god still leaf you with the possibility of be wrong and be damn to another god  s version of hell i see how    disillusionment    enters into it you see i present my mother  s treatment of me to show the cause of my question my atheism a question which continue to this day i have already be an atheist for five year before have any contact with my mother  s version of christianity if anything i have become somewhat disillusion with atheism uh oh i thought what if there  is  a god yes in a way i have also become disillusion by many religion simply because i have thought at one time that they have all the answer if i only found the right one still look but each time i look in a different place i become a little strong in my attitude belief if you will no faith though base on the evidence of past experience that i  ll never find a religion which have all the answer sorta like look for easter egg the more time it take you to find the next one the more convince you become that you may already have found all the egg go to find someone else mention that critisism go to make me think any more highly of christian i have a contrary position constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards christian abusive critisism will turn me off no accusation to you mr  sapienza i merely slip that into this post because i forgot to reply to that one muppets and garlic toast forever max bob muir

 lean     sirach     be more directly reference by james than job or ruth be     in any nt verse see it would help if you mention chapter and verse from sirach and from james job 5 13    he taketh the wise in their craftiness    seem to be quote in 1 corinthian 3 19  james 5 11    you have heard of the patience of job    while not a quote implies that james and his listener be familiar with a story of a man name job who exhibit exemplary patience it be possible that the story they know be not that found in the hebrew bible but rather another similar and related story one have the same problem with direct quote again matthew 1 5    boaz begat obed of ruth    tell u that matthew knew a story about a woman name ruth who married a man call boaz and become the ancestor of david since ruth be not mention in the ot outside the book of ruth it seem likely that matthew be familiar with the book and respect it and thought ruth important enough to be one of the few woman mention in the genealogy reference like this do not prove that the nt writer consider his ot source inspire or inerrant or canonical but neither do direct quote

 all child be born pure i e  without sin however most saint would view a pregnancy outside of marriage a an occasion of mourn some church member would be much more judgmental but that be  their  problem in situation where welfare assistance be provide through our church bishop usually require that the family be make some effort to live the gospel standard and provide for themselves however there be occasion when assistance be provide because of the child in the home a a former bishop of mine say    child be always worthy before god    i be not sure what you mean by the term    bastard    in this context latter day saint believe that through the temple ordinance the family unit may be preserve in eternity if you use genealogical material or software produce by the church you may notice a section for    temple ordinance    within that section there should be a spot for signify    bic    which stand for    born in the covenant    the child born to couple seal married within the temple be    born in the covenant    and be eligible to be part of that eternal family unit child born to other couple whether in a civil marriage or not would have to be seal to their parent after their marriage be solemnize for eternity suppose a child be born to a woman out of wedlock he or she could be seal to his or her parent at a later date or adopt into any eternal family unit which may include one of the birth parent i say if this principle of adoption be reveal at the same time a the seal ordinance but it have be accepted for the  15 year i have be in the church i would tend to discount any admonition from the church authority against have child out of wedlock because even though there be provision within the lord  s plan to recover what we have do wrong the church do not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure
 a lot of stuff delete    focus on just one point a little confuse about the difference between this    weak atheism    a you put it and agnosticism be agnosticism not believe or necessarily disbelieve in anything or what be it i use to be agnostic by this definition    but if weak atheism include not necessarily believe in god then i guess i be one of those actually what i have a hard time understand be people who do not ever decide what they believe i be constantly in a state of self examination a it would appear many others be a well include the atheist of course    assume why here i guess some people really consider it important to think about the answer to    life the universe and everything       any comment just wonder     tough call a these thing seem to be base on faith    wish i could help you but i already try once with someone who be a self professed agnostic thinking of becoming a  christian and it work too well especially tough a still mull over whether or not i believe in miracle look like another email to my chaplain be come up     all i can do be wish you the best of luck and please do post what you find hmm how so i guess i really understand there be time of course when i say to myself    of course i have absolutely no way of know that what i believe in be true except the satisfaction and sense of peace i get from it    which of course could just be psychological    somehow i live with this anyway    be this what you mean the only    proof    i have be that i believe god spoke to me once    which could of course be my own imagination the odd thing be though that if you at some point start believe in something after a while it all get sort of ridiculous maybe just a question of where you draw the line only add one question    have you read pascal what do you think of him if you do also you may or may not be interested by cslewis  _surprised by joy_ be interested in know what you think of him no sarcasm at all intend i just say this because one can never know how one  s write word will be interpret i be not interested in convert you since i seem to have whatever it would take    proof    to do so just interested in learn i like this

 if you agree with joseph  s accurate statement of the catholic dogma of mary  s perpetual sinlessness then how do you interpret luke 1 28 and when the angel have come to her he say    hail full of grace the lord be with thee bless art thou among woman    and luke 1 48     for behold henceforth all generation shall call me bless i suppose that these verse might be interpret to mean that mary be possess of some limited quantity or quality of grace just a some of fill to the brim incapable of contain more the only other people we know of who have an abundance of grace be those soul exist in heaven now another catholic dogma base on the communion of saint a i explain in an earlier post full of grace to me mean sinless and anyone who have ever sin in his life can not be without sin in the same sense a mary be sinless a a catholic i too find certain of the dogma tough to embrace but where the catholic faith and prayer come into play i pray god to strengthen my will to accept the faith give the bride of christ which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in his church and a you probably know faith in christ  s church be tantamount to faith in christ inasmuch a the church be christ  s mystical body a catholic by nature must have two aspect to his faith in christ 1 a personal faith in christ a his own personal redeemer and 2 a community faith in the church a the body of christ    randal lee nicholas mandock catechist gt7122b prism gatech edu
 i would say only to the extent that the roman catholic church neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment a confirm in the recent catechism though there be many rcs who be rather surprised and upset that capital punishment be not explicitly condemn for myself a a catholic i see my own opposition to capital punishment a much the same a my opposition to abortion a reverence for life here in the uk the anti abortion case be often let down by the explicit link which those on the political left make with anti abortionists and pro executionists there be a tendency to condemn people who hold both view a hypocrite i feel that if there be many more anti abortionists who be also vocal in their opposition to capital punishment on a pro life line it would end this kneejerk association of anti abortion a a right wing thing and get many to think seriously about the issue there be plenty who be pro abortion equally for a kneejerk left wing reason i do not think your biblical quote can automatically be take a support for capital punishment i take it that a a roman catholic you be oppose to abortion and would still onsider it wrong and something to be object to even if legalise by    authority

 which kenneth engel challenge i will wimp out and admit that i never like the metaphor of jesus    pay    for our sin in the sense that many christian accept a literal the point be that god understands the suffer we go through not just intellectually like when we watch the somalian on tv but _really_ understands he can    feel    our pain this fact be manifest by jesus life we can argue that someone in history might have suffer more than jesus we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion we can think of case of betrayal and fruitless effort lead to bad despair but the main point be that jesus be in the trench with u he be in everyone whatever i do to the least of humanity i do to him and whatever i do for the least of humanity i do for him now to reconcile this with the existence of hell be beyond my capability but that my goal thankfully our moderator be surprising a i re read this i must admit that this be more of a description of my faith than an explanation but perhaps all i can do hopefully all i have to do

 that be an assumption on your part where be your proof that one always will degenerate into hat the sinner because he hate the sin i be remind of the civil right movement in america it be true that many individual hat the proponent of racism it be also true that many individual hat segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and never degenerate into hat the individual who practice it dr  king s message be this love the individual the love of the individual would transform him into a friend however this do not take away his hatred for segregation his hatred for injustice i would ask    do john the baptist practice love when he criticize the jewish leader of his day    do jesus practice love when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple we must have at least a distase for sin we must in order to fight it in ourselves also we must be ready for the call from god to call sin by it right name jesus love everyone but he call sin by it right name it be true that love for others be to guide every step of our walk but it be also true that sometimes the love for god call u to stand up for truth       competition be the law of the jungle cooperation be the law of civilization       eldridge cleaver
 it trouble me that there have be so many post recently try to support the doctrine of original sin this be primarily a catholic doctrine with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism even among it supporter however people will stop short of say that unbaptised infant will go to hell very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine however if we have the heart to persevere in our belief to make sure that they be biblically base then we can come to an understand of the truth let  s now take a more complete look at scripture colossian 2 11 12    in him you be also circumcise in the put off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision do by christ have be bury with him in baptism and raise with him through your faith in the power of god who raise him from the dead    in baptism we be raise to a new life in christ roman 6 4 through a personal faith in the power of god our parent  s faith can not do this do infant have faith let  s look at what the bible have to say about it roman 10 16 17    but not all the israelite accepted the good news for isaiah say  lord who have believe our message consequently faith come from hearing the message and the message be heard through the word of christ    so then we receive god  s gift of faith to u a we hear the message of the gospel faith be a possible response to hearing god  s word preach kid be not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god  s word hence they can not have faith and therefore can not be raise in baptism to a new life ezekiel 18 20    the soul who sin will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousness of the righteous man will be credit to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charge against him    if you read all of ezekiel 18 you will see that god hold u guilty for anyone else  s sin so we can have no original guilt from adam ezekiel 18 31 32    rid yourselves of all the offense you have committted and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live    the way to please god be to repent and get a new heart and spirit kid can not do this act 2 38 39 say that when we repent and be baptize we will then receive a new spirit the holy spirit then we shall live now then that we have a little more background a to why original sin be not biblical let  s look at some of the scripture use to support it roman 5 12    therefore just a sin enter the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death come to all men because all sin       sin and death enter the world when the first man sin death come to each man because each man sin note that good to read through all of roman 5 12 21  some of the verse be easy to misunderstand than others but if we read them in context we will see that they be all say basically the same thing let  s look at one such roman 5 19    for just a through the disobedience of the one man the many be make sinner so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be make righteous    through the disobedience of each individual each be make a sinner in the same way through the obedience of jesus each will be make righteous we must remember when reading through this passage that death come to each man only because each man sin not because of guilt from adam otherwise the bible would contradict itself i encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own look at it from this point of view to see if it all fit together psalm 51 5    surely i be sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceive me    this whole psalm be a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before god in repentance for sin david himself be a man after god s own heart and write the psalm after commit adultry with bathsheba and murder her husband all that david be say here be that he remember a time when he sinful he be humble himself before god by confess his sinfulness his say that he be sinful at birth be a hyperbole the bible be inspire by god limited to a literal interpetation but also us figure of speech a do jesus john 16 25 for another example of hyperbole see luke 14 26  now then even though people see that baptism require faith and that original sin be not biblical they will still argue that infant baptism be necessary because child sin by be selfish not share toy with other child by be mean hit others and fight etc certainly we have observe child do wrong thing but my gut feel be always that they know any well let  s look to see if the bible agrees with my gut feeling isaiah 7 14 15    therefore the lord himself will give you a sign the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him immanuel he will eat curd and honey when he know enough to reject the wrong and choose the right    now just about any church leader will tell you that this be a prophecy about jesus if they then point them to matthew 1 23 and find a new leader jesus certainly have have less knowledge than normal human baby yet this passage say that he have to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong we see that he do grow and become wiser in luke 2 40 and 2 52  the implication be that jesus do wrong thing a a child before he knew to choose right over wrong since we know that jesus be perfect    without sin we have rather conclusive proof that baby can not sin because they know to choose the right instead of the wrong jesus himself be baptize albeit with john  s baptism not a an infant but a a thirty year old man luke 3 21 23 and start his ministry a soon a he be baptize luke 3 23 immediately afterwards he be tempt by the devil luke 4 1 13 matthew 4 1 11 mark 1 12 13 thank you for your attention moderator this

 that be my point if i play poker with monopoly money i can bet anything i want this be exactly why christianity be missionary in nature not just out of a need to irritate 8  to the people who write the bible and to whom the bible be write there be evidence of love but that be a cultural bias this be a poor answer which you need n t rebut i will now pull the old bait and switch i think you should use the bible to judge man not god by that i mean if your moral intuition like what be described in the bible realize that such thing be go on now i will avoid the semantic argument about the cause of evil and ask what be you do to fight it not you specifically but everyone include myself if i like the genocide in the bible what about the genocide that go on right now to move beyond the question of a hell realize that many people right now be suffer if you think hell fair and be willing to sacrifice everything just to deny it existence what about how life fair right now there be a young mother with three little kid who know how she will get through the day right now there be a sixth grader who be a junkie right now there be an old man with no friend and no money to fix his tv instead of why god help them ask why we help them i think you be correct to challenge any christian who live his life with the compassion you seem to posse you want evidence of god find someone who be make a difference someone you admire someone who have be through some tough time and have come out with his head up ask the person how he do it ask the vietnam vet who be battle medic how he kept his mind ask the woman who be pregnant at 15 kept the baby and now be a successful business woman ask the doctor who have operate on a 1 1 2 pound baby they all be christian or even what you might call religious but there will be something in common god be not define in the bible god be define by what be in those people  s heart it matter if you give intellectual assent to any description heard all wrong anyway the compassion you already feel in your heart be a step in the right direction follow that instead then come back and read the bible and see that same thing described there good i guess we only have to work on your grammar 8
 what you call    the trinity and the catholic church  s definition of it    be precisely the result of the first christian get together and try to find an acceptable answer to your question    what be a christian    i see what you be object to someone be say what historian of all belief would agree on and you be call him a closed minded bigot you really ought to say what you mean by    belief in jesus christ    it be not a word that be sufficient to describe a christian muslim believe in jesus christ although they believe he be a prophet and not the incarnate son of god but follower of eastern religion might be quite happy to say that jesus be the incarnation of god along with large number of other historical and mythical figure so perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say precisely what it be in the traditional definition of what it be to be a christian a hand down by the universal church you object to but regard a unnecessary for be a christian
 ken then what happens when you die why be you here what be the purpose of your life do you think just by chance in the family you be in and have the friend you have why do you think your search to fill the void that exists in your life who do you think can fill that void
 someone quote the follow remove the name because not clear which name go with which level of quote    clh on the basis of these example i would say that joe moore be only wrong in claim augustine a a prime mover of the sin sex view these quote clearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance even within the marriage relationship else they would not apply to mary after her marriage to joseph so joe  s assignment of the reason behind the concept of the perpetual virginity of mary do seem to be support by these quote
 i would just like to point out that the particular command not to eat or fellowship with gentile be not found in the old testament this be part of the    hedge built around the law    it be a part of peter s tradition and not the scripture

 roman 10 16 17    but not all the israelite accepted the good news for isaiah say  lord who have believe our message consequently faith come from hearing the message and the message be heard through the word of christ    so then we receive god  s gift of faith to u a we hear the message of the gospel faith be a possible response to hearing god  s word preach kid be not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god  s word hence they can not have faith and therefore can not be raise in baptism to a new life catholic view the effect of baptism slightly differently and one primary reason why they baptize baby they believe that baptism produce a change in the soul of the baby quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby this change in the baby s soul give the infant certain capability that he would not have without baptism since the infant do not have the use of his intellect and will yet these new faculty be dormant but a the child get old the gift of baptism come more and more into play ezekiel 18 20    the soul who sin will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousness of the righteous man will be credit to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charge against him    if you read all of ezekiel 18 you will see that god hold u guilty for anyone else  s sin so we can have no original guilt from adam adam be give a number of gift by god the chief among them be what catholic call    sanctify grace    in the new testament the word use for this be    charity    by his sin adam lose this grace he lose it just for himself however he lose it for the whole human race because once he lose it he pas it on to his descendent why catholic baptize baby through his original sin adam lose sanctify grace for all his descendent christ institute baptism to give it back to everyone

 here be the short answer because only certain marriage be record in heaven now for the long answer in doctrine and covenant section 132 the chapter discuss eternal marriage and yes plural marriage the distinction between sealing under the priesthood and other marriage be reveal when    the child of this world marry or be give in marriage    when they receive    the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor be give in marriage    luke 20 34 35 jesus be simply teach that marriage    until death do you part    be not in force after death however the doctrine and covenant continue describe eternal marriage d c 132 19 and again verily i say unto you if a man marry a wife by my word which be my law and by the new and everlasting covenant and it be seal unto them by the holy spirit of promise by him who be anoint this power and the key of this priesthood     shorten for brevity ai and shall be of full force when they be out of the world and they shall pas by the angel and the god which be set there to their exhaltation and glory in all thing a hath be seal upon their head which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seed forever and ever the lord told peter    whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven    matt 16 19 do you doubt that peter be give the power to perform sealing peter thought so because he taught that husband and wife be    heir  together  of the grace of life    1 peter 3 7    in order to obtain the high    degree of celestial glory a man must enter into this order of the priesthood    d c 131 2 when a man and wife be seal they truly become    one flesh    because their eternal    increase    destiny be enjoin completely our father have an eternal companion and maybe more because of the plural marriage condition of the law who participate in our creation and be equally concerned with our progress here there be no scriptural basis for this doctrine if fact the only mention of our mother be in one verse of a hymn write early in the history of the church o my father i have learn to call thee father through thy spirit from on high but until the key of knowledge be restore i knew not why in the heav ns be parent single no the thought make reason stare truth be reason truth eternal tell me a mother there why we hear more about our mother 1  because our father presides under priesthood authority which be not a call for her 2  because we all necessarily have the same mother it would be confuse for worship 3  because our father wish to withhold her name and title because of how some people degrade sacred thing
 however greatly we extoll mary it be quite obvious that she be in no way god or even part of god or equal to god the assumption of our bless mother meant that because of her close identification with the redemptive work of christ she be assume note that she do not ascend body and soul into heaven and be thus one of the few along with elijah enoch moses maybe who be already perfect in heaven obviously the virgin mary be far superior in glorification to any of the previously mention personage a i say it be a provocative thought from    answer to job    the logical consistency of the papal declaration can not be surpass and it leaf protestantism with the odium of be nothing but a _man  s religion_ which allows no metaphysical representation of woman     protestantism have obviously not give sufficient attention to the sign of the time which point to the equality of woman but this equality require to be metaphysically anchor in the figure of a    divine    woman the bride of christ just a the person of christ can not be replace by an organization so the bride can not be re  place by the church the feminine like the masculine demand an equally personal representation the dogmatize of the assumption do not however accord to the dogmatic view mean that mary have attain the status of a goddess although a mistress of heaven     and mediatrix she be functionally on a par with christ the king and mediator at any rate her position satisfies the need of the archetype par 753 4 jung should stick to psychology rather than get into theology jung make it clear that he be talk about psychology not theology his comment have to do with the psychological _image_ of god and it function in the human psyche not about the actual existence or nature of god

 much stuff delete excuse me but what make you think that just because atheist he know anything about christianity in my albeit limited experience atheist be often the one who know _more_ about the bible have search it from end to end for answer i myself be a christian but that mean i consider myself more of an authority on my religion    i just have a different perspective on it more bias in favor naturally it seem quite obvious why he be subscribed if i may infer from what motif anyway    at the very least although i dislike this kind of logic one could hope that he will    see the light    critcism will i fear not give him a very positive picture of christian     with regard to this i guess i really feel sentiment of this order can be proven    faith have a lot to do with it this be why those who search the bible from cover to cover for answer necessarily get what look for of course that help anyone who already have faith    what a big catch 22  i discover this quite recently when i ran into an agnostic look for an explanation of my faith and i quickly discover that i could give him nothing more than my life story and a description of my nature faith be a very personal thing    any attempt to    prove    the    fact    behind it must be question likewise    no matter what you believe
 i read somewhere that kurt goedel argue that the ontological argument for god  s existence be logically reasonable or something to that effect do anyone know if this be true and have a citation thanks
 stephen a  creps writes to all     sac also we know that sac the bible say that _everyone_ must be baptize to enter heaven where exactly do it say that sac _everyone_ include infant unless there be other scripture to the sac contrary i e an exception since there be no exception list in the sac bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the bible mean what sac it say that _everyone_ must be baptize to enter heaven i think we do see an exception in the case of cornelius and his household mention in act of course they be baptise but only after    god show that he accepted them by give them the holy spirit    this mean they be already acceptable to god before their baptism and have they suddenly die they would have go to heaven in case that seem far fetched an ancestor of mine be a missionary who work among the herero in namibia some of the tribesman be jealous of christianity and they poison the first convert before he could be baptise surely he still go to heaven inclined to agree with a comment record at the time    it be not the neglect of baptism but it contempt that condemns    mike
 paul  you do a wonderful job of not do anything humany possible to offend u catholic hopefully i can be just a careful in my word a you be i also want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of debate anymore than it already be but just a note or two 1  please talk about jesus    parent       the doctrinal position of the church an unequivocally different regard mary and joseph i personally have never heard of anything be attribute to st  joseph other than his sainthood that be no reference  ever  to him be sinless assume into heaven immaculately conceive etc     all these idea apply only to mary 2  i would agree there be very little scriptural evidence for our doctrine about mary needle to say that present a significant problem to those who accept the bible a the only source of doctrine if however one turn to the sacred tradition of the undivided christian church there be no problem find plently of evidence that it be basically a unanimous belief among the apostle and all the early generation that mary be assume into heaven body and soul etc etc it until the reformation that these doctrine be call into question a far a i be concerned again my personaly feeling if a choice between the apostle or luther i  ll choose the apostle every time whether or not it be record within the writing that the tradition of men have determine to be    the bible
                                                                                                                                       underline mine quean lutibelle yes those who apply it hatefully would be well serve if they if they could alter the bible to reflect their view scene 1 a well in samaria woman but i have no husband jesus yo everybody listen up get your rock ready have some good biblical fun here she be whisper to me that she have a husband yet i know by my secret power that she have have five of them you know how these samaritan be and bad s living with a guy now that s not even married to now i believe in love her and if just raise up those rock like the bible allows and threaten her with a good stone s understand how much we hate the sin but love the sinner we must keep our priority strait l folk 2 000 year from now misunderstand me and believe i cancel all sin scene 2 golgatha 2nd thief you get a raw deal man they catch you do anything wrong like they caught me bleeding jesus now son let me be real clear you say you do something wrong but be you repent i need to be absolutely certain cause if you repent i have a nice room for you in heaven but if you think you might go thieve again i have to cancel your reservation it be nice of you to have pity on me while hang here but you must understand this be all an act not really hurt god you see and the point of all this be to teach you to be perfect like me if you think a simple kind remark to me in suffer be go to get you any favor well think twice but if you will just repent you will become a fundelical in good stand from all such bad news you have deliver u good god thank you thank you thank you quean lutibelle louie
 gain entry into heaven can not be do without first be cleanse by the blood of jesus sin can not dwell in heaven it be against the natural law of god be convert to christianity mean be baptize by the holy spirit you can not get to heaven by good work only because of the union with the holy spirit the man  s behavior will change if there be true union he will not desire to be homosexual fornication and homosexuality will leave your life if you be truly baptize by the holy spirit not to say that we stumble now and then
 in may 13 02 31 16 1993 1569 geneva rutgers edu djohnson cs ucsd edu afraid i see that question a very tendentious try rephrase it what  s more important to christian love of god or love of other human being to which of course the only conceivable answer be that the one be like the other i be  deeply  suspicious of any    flavor    of christianity which would elevate one clause of the great commandment to a    priority    over the other such a to claim a conflict true we be told to let the dead bury the dead to    hate    family rather than let it keep u from follow christ but the dichotomy here be not one between love of our fellow and love of god but of allow  social  construct to blind u to the presense of god it be particularly satanic to twist love of god in such a manner a to become an excuse to treat others a on a different level than the one who be so caught up in    love    of god the trouble come in the relation of human love and human sex yes it have sometimes be the case that the church have    taught    that all sex be nasty evil sinful stuff but when man and wife leave their parental home to become helpmate living in one flesh it be the sex that be the vehicle of become    one flesh    if you doubt me read st  paul on what be wrong with frequent prostitute less provocatively what i mean be just this sexual bonding be a deeply found aspect of our social interaction and in particular be the foundation of the institution of marriage so that unlike with many mammal human male remain with and foster the child they beget and support their child  s mother this be the schema behind genesis 2 18 24 and behind jesus citation of that passage i observe by the way that not all human male in fact do a i have just described but another thing that characterizes human society be our raise of  non begotten child not only orphan and adoptee and the like but product of the quite common infidelity of human to their spouse we be in this not unique in the animal world but the full extent of social consequence and implication be most intricate for u yes of course it sometimes go    wrong       like all else we do it be infect with sin and you find married    couple    where there be no bond and people so deliriously addict to the initial stage of sexual bond formation the    infatuation       fall in love    phase that they break any form bond in order to keep step over the threshold of the deep unity god have prepared for u and step back out again right away satan may indeed  use  sex a a very handy tool to corrupt human love    but in the edenic creation that be not it nature and with god  s grace under the power of christ to make all thing new it need not be a problem for christian though we must be vigilant even in christ a the devil be watchful prowl around like a roar lion seek someone to devour so return to the original question what be more important to straight christian sex or christianity paul clearly tend to think that sex be at best a distraction from christianity though to be charitable to him his context be in expectation of immediate parousia so that the hard task of a married union    the lifelong building and adaptation to each other    seem somehow to undercut the    proper    preparation for an immediate eschaton since we  do not  know the hour of return we should act  both  with instant readiness for that  and  with a commitiment to our mate that proposes a long lifetime together and tell people  not  to bond in such a perspective strike me a cripple u in the second clause of the the commandment to love i would claim that only a very few saint have the capacity to deeply love without sexual tinge or complication mind you their fellow human being unless they have have a deeply spiritual life in married union grow together a one flesh    and that mean in the type case with a persistent and continued sexual relationship we be human and little good come of try to    mortify the flesh    to the point of pretend to be otherwise pretend not to be sexual being it depends entirely on context if that context be major hypocrisy on the part of those who find u    stumble block    i be much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about my sin there be some people for whom a life of celibacy be a spritual gift and maybe even a victory against a to them trouble sexual urge that seem to them to lead only to sin nothing i say should ever be read a demean such a gift nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecific and indeed for all god  s creation that can develop to the full  without  the tutor of a spousal helpmate marriage found in sex but there be a difference between spiritual gift and penance tell people that they have to have a particular gift or else what be fraught with manipulation and disregard of the difference of our spiritual endowment from god to one person be give the gift of speak in toungues to another intepretation of toungues to yet another prophecy and to still another teach the notion that some  particular  gift be require of  all  be one of the early heresy
 i read this entire thread but if someone toss this out yet then here it be 2 samuel 12 21 23 rsv    then his servant say to him what be this thing that you have do you fast and wept for the child while it be alive but when the child die you arose and ate food he david say  while the child be still alive i fast and wept for i say  who know whether the lord will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he be dead why should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he will not return to me    anyhow many interpret this to mean that the child have go to heaven where david will someday go i claim to know for sure if this applies to all baby or not but even if just this one what would you say to this

 if i get a chance i will ask them this weekend                                    the word i have underlined be at the heart of the problem a    quick look    do justice to the depth of the book of jeremiah have study the jeremiah ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life i have to say that there be a great deal of underlie theological meaning in the judgement prophesies let me make one point the clash between jeremiah and the    false prophet    be primarily in the theological realm the    false prophet    understood their relatioship to god to be base on the covenant that the lord make with david it be possible to trace within the page of the old testament who this covenant which be initially conditional on the continued obedience of david s descendant come to be view a an unconditional promise on the part of the lord to keep a descendant of david  s upon the throne and to never allow jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power jeremiah be not a judahite prophet he be from anathoth across the border in what have formerly be israelite territory when he come to prophesy he come from the theological background of the covenant the lord have make with israel through moses the northern kingdom have reject the davidic covenant after the death of solomon his theology clashed with the theology of the local prophet it be out of a very deep understand of the mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international event that jeremiah spoke his prophesies the    judgement prophesies    be deeply load with theological meaning in my opinion both the portland earthquake prophesy and the david wilkerson    new york will burn    prophesy be froth and bubble compare to the majestic theological depth of the jeremiah prophesies    ___ bill rea o o                                                                                                     w    u    w

 bible verse ag   use ag homosexuality delete also check out the episcopal church    although by no mean all episcopalian be sympathetic to homosexual men and woman there certainly be a fairly large percentage in my experience who be i be good friend with an episcopalian minister who be ordain and living in a monogamous homosexual relationship this in no way diminishes his ability to minister    in fact he have a very significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his community a well a a very significant aid ministry my uncle be gay and when i found this out i have a good long think about what the bible have to say about this and what i feel god think about this obviously my conclusion may be wrong nonetheless they be my own and they feel right to me i believe that the one important thing that those who write the old and new testament passage cite above do not know be that there be scientific evidence to support that homosexuality be at least partly _inherent_ rather than completely learn this mean that to a certain extent    or to a great extent    homosexual can not choose how to feel about other people    which be why report of    cure    homosexual always chill me and make me feel ill  please not that although i cite source where you can find this information there be homosexual behavior record among monkey and other animal which be in itself suggestive that it be inherent rather than learn or at least that the word    unnatural    really apply     please remember that whatever you believe gay and lesbian shoul not be exclude from your love and acceptance christ love u all and we all sin and he himself never say anything against homosexual    rather it be paul who also come out with such wonderful wisdom a    woman speak in church    and    woman should keep their head cover in church       not exact quotation a i have my bible handy who say these thing i have a tendency to take some of the thing paul say with a grain of salt     well all say for now vera noyes

 hello brycen a norwegian journalist student and also a christian thanks for your testimony but i want to ask you one question what do you think of heavy metal music after you become a christian you know there be christian band like barren cross whitecross bloodgood and stryper that play that kind of music i like some of it i feel like it sometimes of course i listen to the lyric too i listen to any christian band but well than listen to secular music anyway hope still go strong with christ
 the catholic doctrine of predestination do not exclude free will in any way since god know everything he therefore know everything that be go to happen to u we have free will and be able to change what happens to u however since god know everything he know all the choice we will make    in advance    god be not subject to time too often argument pit predestination against free will we believe in both that last sentence of steve  s be an important one to remember there be certain thing in the catholic religion that can not be completely comprehend by a human be be this not the case it would be good evidence that the religion be man made in the case of predestination you have to reconcile two thing that would at first appear to be irreconcilable the sovereignty of god s will over all thing and man  s free will in decide his own fate catholic believe in both but that mean that anyone have come up with a pat reconciliation
 exactly read that one sentence in there        to the degree that mean other than the death penalty and military operation be sufficient to keep the peace then these non violent provision be to be prefer        i believe that it be necessary for u to murder criminal to keep the peace the church in the united state feel the same way thus the reason that the catholic church have oppose every execution in this country in recent memory so what be justifiable a you state very explicitly from the new catechism the only justifiable case be when it be necessary to keep the peace since that do not apply  at all  to this country the logical conclusion base on your own premise be that one must be oppose to  any  form of capital punishment in america
 the only reason for the death penalty be revenge if you be go to try to refute a position try to refute the whole position or acknosledge that you be only speak to small piece of the problem broad sweep    the only reason    etc on a tough nut to crack a the death penalty reallly help much every year the fbi release crime stats show an overwhelm amount of crime be commit by repeat offender people be kill by folk who have kill who know how many time before how aobut folk who be for the death penalty not for revenge but to cut down on recidivism
 dear fellow christian i have a dinner last night with a bible study group which i be in we have a discussion about the difference between christianity and islam and i be shock to hear that our bible study teacher say that mohammad be indeed a prophet but of satan i say    what    i do not believe that because i have some moslem friend who be so kind and nice even sometimes i feel i wish i could be like them in my point of view they sin a much a i do how come if they be under satan they could have such personality to tell you the truth i know much about islam but i know that they believe in god they believe in the day of judgement now ask you what your opinion about islam and it teach important i do not want to discus whether they be save or not i do not want to discus about politic related to islam p s i post this in bit listserv christia soc religion christian and bit listserv catholic in christ our lord smile             jesus love you         tabut torsina torsina enuxhb eas asu edu let me start by say that this be not the right newsgroup for a discussion of islam since there  s a group for that but i suspect the point your teacher be make be not specifically about islam indeed go to be impossible to see what he be get at within your groundrules since the question of whether non christians be save be at the heart of it the classic christian view which i think most people believe until the last century or so be that christianity and of course judaism be the only religion found by god and that all other religion worship false god and come from satan this be more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but christian and possibly jew will be save this need not mean that there  s no truth in any other religion nor that all of their member be intentionally satanic after all in order to be an effective snare satanic alternative would have to be attractive thus they might contain all kind of truth wisdom and spiritual insight they would be miss only one thing    knowledge of salvation through christ if this be the background of your teacher  s remark    and i suspect it be    that mean that a discussion of islam be not necessarily relevant the point be not that there  s anything intrinsically wrong with it it may teach a fine code of behavior and it practitioner may all be wonderful people but if salvation require be a follower of christ it could still be a satanic invention this be a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position christianity say that salvation a matter of be kind and nice those be good thing and we should encourage them but no one be able to do them enough to be save salvation require christ please forgive me for do this in protestant term there  s a catholic equivalent to this that have similar implication but in different term a religion may be quite attractive in all visible way but if it have christ like a diet that consists of food that look wonderful taste great but be miss some essential food element so that you end up die let me be clear that i be not specifically advocate this position what try to do be a usual to clarify issue indeed it be now relatively uncommon for christian to believe that all other religion be satanic most christian regard such belief a an unfortunate vestige of the past this be part of a general move within christianity in the last century or so to a non judgemental god christian now find it hard to believe that god would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual force be at work in the world do thing like create superficially attractive alternative to christianity whether there be actually a sound basis for the shift be a decision that people need to make for themselves
 this might be well direct to s r c bible study which i have begin reading but since my earlier note be post to this forum i will conclude here a well a week ago i manage to find time to consult a septuagint concordance and a lxx text with apparatus at the library and i can now usefully conclude my look at the greek word for love a use in the christian background of the septuagintal translation of the jewish scripture the principal result be that there be a cluster of us of the verbal noun from _erao _eraste s_ meaning    lover    this cluster occurs just where one might most expect it in the propethic image and accusation of israel a faithless spouse to yhwh the verse in question be hosea 2 5 7 10 jeremiah 4 30 22 20 22 lamentation 1 19 and ezekiel 16 33 36 37 and 23 5 9 22 hosea seem to have originate this usage which jeremiah and ezekiel picked up lamentation be dependent on though not likely write by jeremiah the    erotic    meaning in it allegorical use not at all literally be evident so too in english unless you complement it with a phrase like    of the art    the word    lover    be go to have an overtone of sexual relationship there be no surprise here but it be worthwhile to see that standard greek usage  does  show up in the translation from the hebrew more interestingly and some confirmation of my guess that later koine usage avoid the verb _erao because of it homonymy to _ero say _eromai_ ask there be an error in codex vaticanus normally a very valuable witness where a form of _erao be use in a completely absurd context    2 samuel 20 18 where the meaning  must  be    say    in addition to the above and the us i have already mention in proverb esther 2 17 us the verb in it most natural application kai e rasthe    ho basileus esthe r    and the king love esther and rather more interestingly 1 samuel 19 2 supply a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of david and jonathan kai io nathan huios saoul e i reito ton dauid sphodra    and jonathan saul  s son love david intensely use the bracket i for io ta subscript which i yet have a reasonable ascii convention for the relevance of this to the gay issue be not anything implicit about the    historical    fact but just that a quasi official translation of the hebrew text in the hellenistic period make no bone about use the    erotic    verb in this context give the quite general usage of _agapao for erotic sens this need not mean anything    more    than _agapao alone would mean but it do disambiguate the relationship a far a this translator go
 andrew continue the discussion on the deuterocanonicals     arguably it be both since authority be a matter of both communicator and recepiant we can say that for example    jesus be lord    whether the world at large accepts the authority or not thus the bible can be consider for it authoritative content whether or not it be accepted this issue be at the heart of pilate  s pragmatic question    what be truth    to jesus when our lord be brought before him jesus reply be to appeal to the authority of his father you also might like to consider the claimed authority represent by the statement    thus say the lord    in the bible which claim to put across the exact word of god you fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of inherant authority and claim that it lie only in the    community of faith    do something become truth because it be accepted the main thrust of my argument be that there be a godward direction a well a a manward which be where the reference to rev 22 come in if we narrow it down to the predictive element which will cut out some of the 39 accepted ot book a well we nonetheless have criterion for determine the validity of the book jesus standard be that    scripture can not be broken    can you name a single prophecy that fit the bill in the apocrapha ie definitely fulfil after it have be write do it have a subjective  ring of truth about it and do other evidence that have come to light contradict or confirm the authenticity archaeological other textual evidence for example what this be get at be the relationship between text and reader it be to do with the quality of write which should have the ability to fire the mind affect our thought life and cause u to act in a certain way there be something of this in jesus quote    man do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the lord    matt 4 4 do the catholic church give the same authority to the apocrapha a to the accepted 66 book certainly it be not a widely use a the ot and nt think about what i have say above you may want to revise your conclusion in addition think about other  sacred writing eg the koran the book of mormon and how and why you would categorise them use the above principle one word of caution you may find some  reflected glory in some of these book in that the  inspired quality may be derive from the bible remember that lucifer be quite capable of appear a an angel of light and quote scripture what be you think of lose the point and the context here i be not argue that the statement in rev can be apply indescriminately just that the whole acceptance rejection idea do not just follow on from man made tradition but there be i believe an act of god involve in the selection and criterion of what be classify a scripture and come under the definition of 2tim 3 16
 this be a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a share on the    johannine hour    a propose each month by the monk of the ecumenical community of taize pronounce te zay in france

the bible  s message in the midst of their daily life because of work or study it be often impossible to spend long hour in silence and reflection but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the wood there in silence we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of christ during the time of silence it be important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worry if in some biblical expression we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ the idea be to communicate to others what we have understood of christ not burdening them with our own hesitation but rather tell them what have brought u joy what have lead u to run the risk of trust more deeply perhaps those who read and think about the    johannine hour    in this newsgroup could share their reflection and discovery with others the important thing be the complementarity between two aspect the personal aspect of silent

 gerry palo write that there be nothing in christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of life i write that the apostle paul in roman 9 speaks of god a choose jacob over esau and add that this be not a a result of anything that either child have do since they have not be born yet clearly paul do not believe that they have have previous life nor do he suppose that his reader will believe it for if they have have previous life it would not make sense to say    neither of them have do anything good or bad a yet since they be not yet born    daniel cossack writes to ask whether it be fair for god to hate easau when esau have do nothing bad i reply that in hebrew it be standard usage to speak of hat when what be meant be simply put in second place a an example consider the say in matthew 6 24 no man can serve two master for either he will hate the one and love the other or     now it be obviously false that a man with two master must hate one of them but it be obviously true that he must put one of them in second place a dog that always come when either billy or bobby call will have a problem if they stand in different place and call simultaneously it can not give first priority to both one must take second place in our original example second place mean that jacob not esau be chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation and to be the ancestor of christ                               eugene bigelow mention matthew 11 14 which say of john the baptist and if ye will receive it this be elijah who be to come i take this to mean that john be an elijah like figure dress and living like elijah preach like elijah and fulfil the prediction that elijah would prepare the way for the messiah i do not think that he be elijah in a literal sense and appareently neither do he john 1 21
 i and i thought i do a pretty good job of qualify my statement but apparently some people misinterpret my intention i apologize for my part in communicate any confusion my intent be more to stir up discussion rather than judge it seem to have work rest of post note by the way i do not originally post this to alt atheism if it get there i know how it do
 when an allege private revelation attracts sufficient attention the church may investigate it if the investigation indicates a likelihood that the allege private revelation be in fact from god it will be approve that mean that it can be preach in the church however it be still true that no one be require to believe that it come from god a catholic be free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attest and strongly approve private revelation such a those at fatima and lourdes i suspect that few if any catholic do reject fatima and lourdes but if any do their rejection of them do not mean they be not orthodox catholic in good stand it may be a bit much to say that a catholic be free to deny what happen at fatima a bit strong it be sort of like say that a catholic be free to deny that hong kong exists what a catholic  is  free to do be to deny the truth of fatima without be call a heretic you can be label other thing for such an offense but not a heretic theologian make a basic distinction a far a the degree of assent one must give to event like fatima and lourdes thing reveal by god through jesus christ or his apostle must be give the assent due to a revelation of god total and unswerving fatima and lourdes demand our assent a much a any other well attested event in human history perhaps a bit more give the approval of the church    approval    of an apparition by the church principally mean that whatever happen be in harmony with the catholic faith i personally think of private revelation a our lord  s way of tell u what to do at particular period in history he give u all the doctrine etc  2000 year ago but we can always use some help in know how exactly to apply what he give u catholic devotion to the sacred heart be a result of a series of apparition to st  margaret mary alacoque for example the problem at the time be extreme moral rigorism that be turn our lord into someone without a heart

 what we call today the    old testament    be be write up to approx  imately 168 bce accord to most modern scholar aside from the book of daniel the whole ot predates alexander the great these book be write predominantly in hebrew there be also other book be write at about this time and later by greek speaking or    hellenistic    jew these book be those which be reckon by many denomination a    apocrypha    before the closing of the writing the third part of what be today call the canon all of the book be in use by jew of the day however there be those who reckon base on zech 13 that prophecy have cease this faction maintain that there be no true prophet in their day they also maintain that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teaching from god by the time of c 65 ce another faction have enter the mess christian have come in claim that their writing be also suitable to be read in synagogue and use for worship therefore the palestinian jewish leader get together and state that the book write from the time of ben sira sirach onward be not sacred writing they justified this from zech 13  in particular they say the writing of the christian call heretic be not inspire at about 90 ce they codify thing far by closing the canon in somewhat of an official sense at the council of jamnia a few book ecclesi  astes song of song esther make it in after that date but these be those which have be write prior to the official cut off point the time of ben sira for inclusion that they have establish in order to keep out the christian and hellenistic writing jerome exclude the  apocrypha because they be not in use by jew of his day and because they be except for sirach not found in hebrew in his time his criterion for separate them from the other pre christian writing be not base on  inspiration

 easy vs  hard       easy on who i have a rare very personal talk with my mother last year she say that when she and my father be raise we four child they do not try to raise u in this world a strictly a they be raise in their norwegian lutheran community they felt that we would be alienate from them and it would create problem in other word my parent do the very tolerant love thing they raise u without conflict without what we saw a unreasonable demand and be always accept no matter what the circumstance what happen be that i grow up believe in situation ethic and never absolute i believe in a love god and my concept of god never involve justice or punishment nor be there any concept that i may someday be held responsible for the thing that offend him     sin that the    world    told me be ok  my parent be very good honest and moral people they raise four extremely honest child yet before come to a more complete knowledge of god which include the knowledge of justice and punishment i commit what i now believe to be many many grave sin i live with a partner outside of marriage be married and divorce only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change     but i have married to person in the first place and more     my parent felt they be do the love kind thing by allow u to be who we be by not impose their standard on u and by accept unquestioningly everything we do without judgement or counsel today it be absolutely appal for me to look back on what they  did  accept without a word it take courage to dare to help soul because you must speak up and say what be unpopular and difficult and what people do not want to hear you must be able to say what be hard and say it a christ would with love and compassion it involves risk      perhaps someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you this life be    but dust    a long a the comfort of this life be our high priority we will fail god and fail those with whom we come in contact i wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage who support the    right    to abortion who engage in homosexuality or who commit any of the range of sin that be plentiful in this time have ever heard from a quiet thoughtful love friend that these thing be  wrong  no one ever told me that what i be do be wrong and i saw multitude around me living the same way i be and they seem like good decent people kick dog or beat the elderly or babies   it be more difficult for sinner without a genuine prayer life to hear the holy spirit than it be to hear a love friend think about this the next time the holy spirit tell you that a friend be in error but you want to    cause trouble    righteous prayer be great power but forget that we be we be christ  s lip and hand on earth be afraid to simply voice truth when the situation call for it say a fervent prayer and ask the holy spirit for love and guidance in more way than we may realize we  are  our brother s keeper

 this be a point that seem to have be overlook by many the end of a 1600 year old schism seem to be in sight the theologian say that the difference between them be fundamentally one or terminology and that the christological faith of both group be the same some parish have concelebrated the eucharist and here in southern africa we be run a joint theological training course for coptic and byzantine orthodox there be still several thing to be sort out however a far a the copt be concerned there be three ecumenical council whily the byzantine orthodox acknowledge seven
 conviction of sin a meta exegetical or methodological essay i look forward to reading it when i get to the library last week it be with the object in view to look at some article that have appear over the last few year since my previous look at the literature un  fortunately they have move the journal back issues so i get a look at the article i be hop to find i will continue to reserve my own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until i have see the late scholarly work and i can hope that rexlex  s post may give some meat to chew on however what i  can  do now be to point out the methodological issue    what need to be show for anything to be conclude in this matter if the article rexlex post address these issue so much the well if not you will perhaps understand why the problem be hard writes _in abstractu_ it be only a minor point but let me make it anyway de young have already contradict his own prior assertion in this abstract that the ancient analysis of these issue be concerned with action and not with orientation i doubt this will have much bearing on the article a such but thought i should point it out from the start the hypothesis de young be advance be that paul a coin the word and b his intend meaning for it be in reference to the levitical law the question i wish to raise be 1 how would one go about confirm the truth of this hypothesis and 2 what follow if one accepts or stipulates for the sake of the discussion that it be correct note that b be independent of a i consider b far more plausible than a which seem merely to be a counsel of despair over find nothing in the literature contemporary with paul to clarify this word so far a i know paul do not in general invent word anywhere else in his letter unless you have an otherwise established pattern of coinage it be  not  sound methodology to assume it    particularly if he give no hint in the immedi  ate text to    fix    the coinage  s meaning for his audience a yet the extract present no evidence at all what do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis which i should say at the outset i find somewhat plausible i certainly know of nothing which make it an  impossible  way of construe this problem passage go to set aside for the moment the question of whether paul might have coin this usage to look at the more tractable question of what it mean for this there be in principle two kind of evidence that can be adduce internal and external that be we can look at the text of paul  s letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writing that paul might have rely on or to derivative writing that have some claim of access to paul  s meaning the single bad problem with this word in corinthian be that there be no internal evidence for paul  s meaning he us the word totally without an explanation or hint a to his meaning save that it inclusion in a list of negative implies that it have for him some negative meaning we be left a the only    internal    clue with the etymology or formation of the word    which be indeed the reason that de young and others before him have associate it with the leviticus prohibition of men verbing with other men where verb be some standard euphemism for have sex    lie    in leviticus    bed    in greek one problem be that    bedder    _ koitai_ be not a far a i know use that way in greek therefore i offer one serious test which de young  s hypothesis  must  pas or be reject o find a body of greek text contemporary with paul or not much prior to his day such that the _x koitai_ formation implies    men who have sex with x    obviously the    best case    be to find such usage of _arsenokoitai_ itself such text would be confirmation that the word  can  be read that way it be worth emphasize that compound word be not in general under  standable by project what the reader may imagine by the juxtaposition of the root existence of such parallel  prove  the hypothesis correct    but it go a long way towards make such a usage whether or not original with paul in the specific case of x    _arse n_ possible of comprehension by his reader my    test    move in the direction of external evidence if paul do not in his text explain his word and he do not then he have to expect his reader to already know the word which stand against it be a coinage or to expect that it mimic word formation that they  do  know such that they can guess his meaning without too much flounder external evidence that be text other than paul  s own and lexicographic or social historical consideration that might be adduce then come into the picture  if  there be other us of the word not dependent on paul which  have  sufficient internal contextual evidence    or some gloss by a contemporary scribe    to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu  ality or similar _ koitai_ formation use in similar way  then  one have ground for o deny that paul coin the word and o assume that his reader might understand his meaning do you see the problem if paul coin the word then he require his reader to share enough context with him to comprehend his coinage and it intent    in this case that they would stipulate de young  s guess understand him to be refer to the levitical    universal    prohibition of male male sex this mind you in a context where paul have emphasize at least to other congregation and so one assumes to the corinthian    how else to explain 1 cor 6 12 and the corinthian have to be pull back from overinterpreting their freedom the non applicability of torah law to his gentile convert among the consideration that make it implausible for paul to have coin the word it first element be archaic    _arse n_ be an old attic or ionic form of what in even classical let alone koine time would be assimilate a _arre n_ to me this implies that we be even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage what be paul do invent a word in obsolete attic formation and if he    coin the word but picked it up like the others in his list a common term of derogation then his meaning will be    for his reader    constrain by that common meaning since he give no other i can not emphasize enough that paul do not tell u what he mean by this word we and his original reader be guess they at least have a contemporary context    and maybe paul have use this very word and explain it in great detail to them in person but we have no trace of evidence of that and to  suppose  it be mere fantasy so    we be  desperately  in need of external evidence about this word and it seem to be exceptionally meagre that be precisely the problem i can think of several more or less equally plausible hypothesis about the word a it be a standard gutter term of abuse for some or all maybe very specific maybe very general homosexual male activity b it be a term of abuse use by jew about the awful homosexual greek which may or may not be consciously associate on their part with the leviticus passage c paul invent the term    and again there may or may not be an association with leviticus in his do so he may or may not intend the word to have an explicit and universal application with absolute and clear boundary since none of his other word in that list have such character this last seem to me about the  least  plausible of the hypothesis advance of these say off the top of my head that a be most plausible    but i still have reservation about that too if the word never appear before paul and in later us have some evidence of depend on paul then one can opt for paul  s coin it if it do appear before him he might  still  have coin it be unaware of prior use in which case his coinage be inherently confuse but one should normally demote c on the basis of any earlier us especially if they can be show to have be at all common in the place paul travel in either of the a or b case one have to take into account paul  s relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from    and whether it be from the greek or jewish community paul  s relation be hardly straight  forward there be so far a i have yet see little or no external evidence to aid u in select one of these or some other hypothesis your guess be a good a mine or maybe bad or maybe well depend on a lot of thing but it remains    so far    guesswork and i know about you but i for one will not equate human guesswork with the will of god by all mean be convince in your own conscience about what paul be get at    a he say elsewhere on what be in his day a major controversy of somewhat this same character roman 14 22 23    hold on to your own belief a between yourself and god    and consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without go against his conscience but anybody who eats in a state of doubt be condemn because he be not in good faith and every act do in bad faith be a sin    for my part i can not see any way to resolve paul  s meaning in the use of _arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence    and by the nature of such external evidence it will never reach to certainty of constrain paul  s own intent paul like humpty dumpty and me and all the rest of u  will  use word in way that be personal choice    and sometimes leave his reader puzzle if that puzzlement lead you to god it may be bless    if it should lead away a some of paul s word have lead some people then paul  s intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our soul may have some regretable consequence i have always found paul to be a fantastically reliable guide    if i read him    in the large    if i can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again i be much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passage such a this one in my usual discursive way i have go on at great length about the first of my intend meta exegetical point    what would be need to confirm that paul a coin or b in any case meant the word to mean the same a the leviticus prohibition my second point be to  stipulate  this hypo  thesis and follow up what it implies for both his initial reader and for later christian give my verbosity this will be tomorrow night s meditation
 yes but no more than he be worth seriously jerome be merely and grandly another christian witness to be take for what he can tell u he be one in the community of saint you seem to wish for a great polarization and dichotomy between catholic and protestant thought than seem to me from a historical perspective to be valid to be sure rome reject some significant aspect of protestant thought just a vehemently a protestant reject some significant aspect of roman thought other than some peoplw who apparently try to embody the great extreme of this rejection on either side there be not quite so vast a gulf fix a casual observer seem to assume ecumenical consultation between rome and the lutheran a well a those between rome and the anglican communion to which i belong show very nearly complete convergence on understand the basic theological issue    the stick point tend to be ecclesiology and church polity thus for example a you go on to say many of u do not regard a papal decretal a have any necessary a oppose to political significance sometimes it will sometimes it you misread me if you think that my communion at least    throw out    the deuterocanonical book nor do i think you should overstress the sense in which the more reform may do so i seriously suggest you rethink what you be say here it verge on and could be take a anti semitic in the bad sense the    unbelieving    jew be accord to what i understand a a christian the chosen people of god and the recipient of his pre incarnational revelation i think they have some say in the matter the javneh meeting should not be over interpreted a recent magisterial study title _mikra_ i have more citation information on hand sorry produce primarily from the background of christian rather than specifically jewish scholarship suggests strongly that the javneh meeting mostly resolve a linger question where in practice the canon have long be fix on the basis of the scroll that be kept in the temple and thereby    make the hand unclean    when use the list of    sacred book    that may be drawn up from josephus and other pre yavneh source correspond plus or minus one book if i rememeber the chapter correctly to the current jewish canon of tanakh all of this be not to    throw out    the deuterocanonicals what by the way be your position about the book the greek accept and rome do not    just to observe that the issue be complex and simply binary judgment do not do it justice
 between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occur this involve a gradual dim of consciousness of the spiritual world this be discernable in the world outlook of different people through history the greek for example could say    well a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead    iliad i think i would not swear that nothing of the sort be found in the iliad but the first passage i thought of be the odyssey 11 480 or thereabouts my copy have no line number the ghost of acchilles speaks robert fitzgerald translation well i say to break sod a a farm hand for some poor country man on iron ration than lord it over all the exhaust dead the next passage i thought of be from ecclesiastes 9 4 a living dog be well than a dead lion on the other hand there be one notion firmly embed in christianity that originate most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human be consists essentially of soul only and that the soul be create at birth be consciously adopt from aristotle whose idea dominate christian thought for fifteen hundred year and still do today     surely aristotle have little influence on christian thought before about 1250 ad
 mary at that time appear to a girl name bernadette at lourdes she refer to herself a the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of know about the doctrine the apparition be deem to be true and it seal the case for the doctrine  bernadette be 14 year old when she have her vision in 1858  four year after the dogma have be officially proclaim by the  pope yours james kiefer i forgot exactly what her age be but i remember clearly that she be born in a family of poverty and she do not have any education whatsoever at the age of the apparition she suffer from asthma at that age and she and her family be living in an abandon prison cell of some sort she have to ask the  lady several time in her apparition about what her name be since her confessor priest ask her to do so for several instance the priest do not get an answer since bernadette do not receive any one time after several apparition pass the lady finally say    i be the immaculate conception    so bernadette be so happy and repeat these word over and over in her mind so a not to forget it before she told the priest who be ask so when she told the priest the priest be shock and ask bernadette    do you know what you be talk about    bernadette do not know what exactly it meant but she be just too happy to have the answer for the priest the priest continued with    how do you remember this if you do not know    bernadette answer honestly that she have to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest     the priest knew about the dogma be four year old then but bernadette do not know and yet she have the answer which the priest finally observe and take a proof of an authentic personal revelation of our lady to bernadette note this lady of lourdes shrine have a spring of water which our lady request bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hand in front of pilgrim at the start little water flow but after several year there be more water flow
 see a how _the_two_babylons_ have be brought up again it be time for me to respond once again and say that this book be junk it be nothing more that an anti catholic tract of the sort publish ever since the there be protestant it scholarship be phony and it assertion spurious
 recently an e mail to me mention technically the messenger even human so it    be a case of    homosexuality       even of rape     the jude reference to sodom be also meaningful only in the context of the sodomite    lust    for the    other flesh    of angel again application to homosexual behavior in general or to the position of gay christian be largeely specious     be angel    flesh    no i feel that this be say that it be because of their lust after other men who be flesh or of this world what be other opinons on this i heard much about this verse at all in christ  s love bryan
 regard the consequence of the original sin catholic believe that what adam primarily lose by his sin for himself and the human race be sanctify grace this be basically a share in the divine life take a rock and make it able to talk what god do to a human be through sanctify grace be similar it make such a one able to live on a plane that be above the power of any possible creature this be the    everlasting life    that the new testament speaks of what christ do when he come be to restore this life of sanctify grace to the human race he institute the sacrament a the mean by which this life be give to people and it increase foster the absence of sanctify grace at death mean automatic exclusion from heaven the nature of heaven be such that impossible for a human be to have any part in it without the gift of sanctify grace to use my example it would be like take that rock and attempt to hold a conversation with it rock can not talk neither can human being live in heaven without sanctify grace this all obviously applies equally well to infant or adult since both have soul infant must be baptize therefore or they can not enter into heaven they too need this form of life in them or they can not enter into heaven turn it around infant baptism be good support evidence for the catholic belief in sanctify grace unless baptism cause some change in an infant  s soul there be no particular reason to insist on the practice yet infant baptism be probably practice by the apostle themselves and be  certainly  part of the church shortly thereafter
     thanks for post the exact word which i have not see previously the part i quote above seem to me to indicate disapproval of capital punishment it be to be use only when other mean be not sufficient i would say this be a strong restriction than say that capital punishment be useable when justifiable i would certainly say there be case where a crime justifies death perhaps this be the old testament interpretation but my reverence for life would say that i would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty a new testament interpretation it be a matter for debate whether the death penalty work to keep the peace in a way that non violent provision do not i believe it do and i would certainly observe that in the usa where you have the death penalty there be a far high murder rate than here in the uk where we do not

 well i be one of those apparently odd people who can sometimes control their dream for example i might decide before go to sleep that i want to repeat a favourite dream or dream about a specific place or if i be have an unpleasant dream i can often not always redirect event to something more pleasant i guess i think that the same standard apply in these    direct    dream a apply in wake fantasy or real life ref jesus teach about look at a woman lustfully be the same a commit adultary when my normal dream display theme that i would not conciously chose to dream about i take that a a sign that all be not well with my    inner life    maybe i have underlie tenstions fears that need to be resolve or maybe it straightforward sin in either case the cause need to be resolve in fact either case be pretty rare i often remember dream that i chose to have when i do they almost always tell me something important i also almost never dream in picture and especially not in colour in fact have precisely one full colour picture dream that i can remember and it be definately spiritually important i tend to dream in sound with the odd blur image in black and white interest topic i  ll be fascinate to read other response alison
 meta exegesis conviction of sin part ii let me return to the question stipulate that paul meant his use of _arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the levitical prohibition of male male sex in order to bring out the problem most clearly i ll also stipulate what i think be far less plausible that paul coin the term for this usage the question i want to turn to be what that would mean for paul  s reader and for later christian this should be shorter than my last note a we will see that this question rapidly confronts u with some of the major division within christ  s body and i be not try to open the gate for flame across any of the terrible chasm that separate any of u from our fellow christian my own bias loosely characterizable a    liberal    will be evident but i be not grind an axe here so much a try to get all party to see that it may be hard to reach    closure    when the issue involve strike at the heart of what we each in our own different way see a crucial to the gospel of christ so stipulate paul  s intent the immediate question be how can his reader understand this intent and follow on that question there be a second one what be our proper action if we  do  manage to understand him since paul give not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st corinthian there be two    positive    answer and one    negative    to this question a  paul or apollo or someone in the apostolic community have conveyed to the corinthian the then traditional jewish condem  nation of homosexual behavior and paul expect them to be sufficiently well tutored by this tradition that he need no futher explanation i should note that there be no evidence in the letter or in 2 corinthian for such a supposition b  the spirit will teach u what paul mean or if not paul what god mean    behind    paul  s inspire word choice c  we    know and can not guess to within any well pre  cision here than for comparison in the parallel use by paul in the same passage of the word _pleonektai_    those who have more       if you think that _areseonkoitai_ be    obvious    from it root try cut your teeth on  this  word the neb translates it a    grabber    or even _methusoi_    drunkard       at least this have the advantage of be a common insult so that at least there be  some  hint a to it meaning the three position more or less    if i can be allow some exaggeration for the sake of argument    define a classical catholic attitude towards tradition one form of protestant _sola scriptura_ and a liberal critical demand for evidence all three position have strength and weakness _ad_ a it be unquestionable that the gospel be preach in and by the community of christ  s disciple and their successor and that our nt scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition but also the case that we know little or nothing about this tradition until almost a century after paul which be to say that we have access to the tradition only after several generation of possibly confuse transmission the scripture be itself our only documentation of the tradition in the critical era _ad_ b if we be not born of water and spirit to revert to john in an attempt to explain paul then we have no more hope of under  stand the gospel than nicodemus have neither the tradition of men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the spirit from blowing where it will    the paraclete be a kamikaze but the downside of protestant belief in the efficacy of the spirit a our guide in scripture be that the wing of protestantism that take this most seriously be also the most fragment over divergent understand supposedly derive from the    clear    word of god note classical lutheran calvinist and anglican thought constrains scripture to be read  within  tradition even while reserve judgment against tradition out of scripture the more bizarre form of    i will read scripture my way    be primarily a fringe aspect of    cultic    protestantism the main problem with this approach be that there be apparently no mean for one person to convey to another what that one may feel  is  teach receive from the spirit and history show incredible conflict between christian on this point each in his own mind    convince    that he be lead by the spirit no one can seriously urge point b without some sense of it potential for set christian against christian to what purpose _ad_ c the critical approach have the distinct advantage that when it can reach a conclusion it can lay out the data in a way which be open to all the weakness be an obvious corollary this be not usually possible if i may say a word here out of my own already acknowledge bias one complaint against critical methodology be that it    dissolve    faith    but surely a    faith    that can not honestly face the evalu  ation of evidence have problem which mere theology be helpless to address anyway there be a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between    liberal    and    conservative    position mostly on the basis of extreme zealot of position b and c  a catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain argument of b contra c to secondary position so that despite horrendous strain rome be not a likely to find these issue a ultimately divisive a the protestant world will and anglican will i predict muddle through on the _via media_ attempt to give each position it due but no more than it due second question suppose tradition tell u and lot of    spiritual    christian tell u and critical thought at least admits a possible that paul be refer to a flat universal levitical prohibition against male male sex what then again we can abdicate our personal responsi  bility to tradition and let it dictate the answer but precisely where inherit tradition be not question that most dangerous we have example of christ question the pharisee and their use of tradition despite his urge in matthew 23 2 that we be to heed them we have example of peter and more radically still paul jettisoning the tradition that they be lead by the spirit to call into question jesus and peter and paul do not so much    throw out    tradition a subject it to radical criticism on a couple of very basic ground    the weightier demand of the law justice and mercy and good faith    matthew 23 23 and    on these two commandment love god neighbor hand the whole law and the prophet also    matthew 22 40 if there be a fundamental because derive from christ validity in the challenge to  some  tradition a validity that lead the first generation to go so far a to waive application of the torah to gentile convert vastly beyond anything that be directly deducible from jesus report word and deed it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to  postulate  that  only  the tradition that we have specific challenge against be in fact open to challenge all tradition pass  through  men be tradition  of  men that god may lead u even so that these tradition be a source of our spiritual instruction i will freely grant but tradition be inherently human and inherently corruptible and give the fall corrupt nothing in it be immune to challenge when the spirit show u a failure in justice mercy and good faith nothing may ultimately stand unless it do follow from love of god and love of neighbor i be perfectly willing to grant that i could be blind to my own sin that the spirit may have taught another what she refuse to teach me or i be too dense to learn that tradition  might  have value here but what i  know  of tradition be that on one occasion some superstitious christian appeal to justinian after an earthquake in asia minor and scapegoated    sodomite    a the    cause    of the earthquake so that legislation be pass make homosexual behavior a capital offense if that be in accord with the gospel of christ then i be no christian that be human tradition at it most hateful and vicious and i see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruption onto usenet of people who be quick to condemn but slow to understand if that be the lead of the spirit then i want no part of it but what i have found in obedience to the lord be that i be myself totally dependent on the witness of other christian for the truth that life in the body of christ and i say to all who doubt that gay christianity be from god what gamaliel say to doubt pharisee who would have suppress the early church    be careful how you deal with these people     if this enterprise this movement of theirs be of human origin it will break up of it own accord but if it do in fact come from god you will not only be unable to destroy them but you might find yourselves fight against god    act 5 36     39 all i ask be that you listen to your tradition and read your scripture with a mind and soul open to the spirit and to the past history of our first christian witness willingness to challenge tradition and other reading of scripture    though read with all the authority of scribe and rabbi    and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of god and neighbor then study the evidence learn the history of christian oppress christian out of their tradition and eagerness to judge where jesus and paul tell u not to judge and let the witness of the spirit in the life of your fellow christian    include those who be not of your preference in theology    guide you towards god  s truth    michael l  siemon i say    you be god son of the ml panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall ml ulysses att  com like any prince    psalm 82 6 7 there  s a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position a a to whether speak of tradition in paul  s time or ours i think there be two way to use tradition one be to say that when paul and his reader share a tradition it make sense to interpret his word in the context of that share tradition what make me think that these argument over word turn out to be silly we know that paul come out of a background that be rather puritanical on sex everything else he say on sex be consistent with that background the tone of his remark on homosexuality in rom 1 be consistent with that background even if the word in the sin list the most general term for homosexual activity and it seem to me that there s some evidence that they be not they be just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all    that paul share the common jewish rejection of homosexuality but when you identify a with the catholic position rather a horse of a different color the catholic position involves a continue church tradition argument specific to that tradition might be 1 we can get guidance on how to interpret paul  s original meaning from tradition e g the way the church father interpret him and 2 we gain confidence that his prohibition still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours i think this be a somewhat different use of tradition a radical protestant might be willing to use know 1st cent tradition to illuminate paul  s original meaning but not use the catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be
 though you can certaily assert all this i see why it necessarily have to be the case why hate just stay a it be and not beget more who say we have to get disgust and start hat the sinner i admit this happens but i donlt think you can say it be always necessaily so why can we not hate with a perfect hatred certainly we should love even our enemy amos 5 15 say to hate the evil and love the good this contradict christ  s teach i think we tie up both hate and love with an emotional attitude when it really should be consider more objectively surely i fly into a rage at every sin i see but why can i not    hate    it

 i think the issue of whether infant have faith be relevant or not certainly they  can  a the example of john in utero prof i find the translation of col 2 above odd in term of the circumcision of christ which the kjv and rsv put in term of christ  s cricumcision which we in union with him  participate  in put off the body of sin of the flesh also perhaps cor 2 12 be divide the act of burial with him in baptism which can be independant of faith from the experience of rise with christ by faith who say both be by faith this interpretation have the advantage of explain those who be faithlessly baptize for whom their baptisim be not benefit but serf to put them into the kingdom nonetheless like the israelite all of them child include who be baptize in the cloud and in the sea it be of no advantage because they do not add to their baptism faith and obedience baptism do not impart faith nor be it do strictly speak on the basis of the faith of the parent but because of the covcenant promise of god it imparts grace the grace of the kingdom which can be a punishement in disguise if there be later apostacy do you teach a child to pray the lord  s prayer do you expect them to not steal they  can  have faith appropriate to their condition and in the new covenant we shall no longer say know the lord for they shall all know him from the least unto the great heb 8 11  but also accord to ezekiel 18 god will not hold innocent anyone on the basis of anyone el innocense thus jesus could not be our federal head any more than adam  if  what ezekiel be talk about shall you make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt a well ezekiel 36 25 26 indicates that this new heart will be give by god in the context of the sprinkle of water in baptism it be the action of god put them into his new order and not a question of    personal    faith a such but the death that come to all because of sin be not just their personal death but the dead state originbal sin we be in a covenant of death because adam our federal head give over his dominion to the devil and death while this psalm be figurative in language it be not hyperbolic and the one do not necessarily imply the other there be not other hyperbolic language in this psalm what v 5 be likely refer to be what be symbolize by the ot cleanliness law which make intercourse and childbrith both act which caus uncleannes and seperation from god the whole psalm be in the language of ot ritual hyssop cleanse burnt offering etc david  s sin with bathsheba include this element a he do not ritually cleanse himself when he should have but what be symbolize by the ot ritual be the truth that sin be pass generationally why the organ of generation have to be cut why brith be unclean uncleanness be death and all baby be born dead and need to be wash to newness of life which we have in baptism today
 mary at that time appear to a girl name bernadette at lourdes she refer to herself a the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of know about the doctrine the apparition be deem to be true and it seal the case for the doctrine bernadette be 14 year old when she have her vision in 1858 four year after the dogma have be officially proclaim by the pope

 that depends on how this verse be read there be at least two meaning of the word    once    1 only one time and 2 at some other time i e once upon a time note that in the previous verse the word    once    be use with the second meaning and also in the follow verse    once    be again use with the second meaning the greek i be sure us different word for each of the two meaning for the english word    once    i be not a greek scholar but sure someone here can verify which greek word be use here for this meaning if the second meaning be be use that verse can be interpret a for it be once give for men to die begin with adam but after this gift of atonement offer by jesus christ the judgement be make available for now there be no longer death but life with christ
 i have enrol in    the history of christianity    at a college here in st  louis the teacher of the class be what i consider to be closed minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of christianity be his definition be tie directly to that of the trinity and the catholic church  s definition of it and belief in jesus christ be not sufficient to call one  s self a christian while his say it make it so i nevertheless feel insult or be i just neurotic i would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintain an amiable student teacher relationship so be there common definition of what christianity be a the previous discussion of the trinity do not lend itself to an exchange of flame i be hopeful that this will also not produce major flame regard    larry autry silicon graphic st  louis autry sgi com often we get into discussion about who be christian unfortunately there be a number of possible definition start from the broad commonly use definition be a historical definition people who accept christ a lord and savior a broad doctrinal definition narrow doctrinal definition 1 by a historical definition i mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use this would include any group that developed out of the christian church and continue within the same broad culture e g some unitarian would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with yet clear that that group developed from christianity and people from very different background e g hindu would likely see them a part of christianity this be not a definition most christian like but relevant in some political and ethnic context 2 accept christ a lord and savior be a test use by many christian group for membership e g the southern baptist and presbyterian church usa i would qualify it by say that what most people have in mind be an exclusive commitment to christ so that someone who accepted christ a one of many god would not fit an attempt to formulate a criterion that be religious but be not base on technical doctrine by this definition group such a arians would be view a heretical christian but still christian in the modern context this would include mormon jw  s and    oneness pentecostal    they would be view a heretical christian but still christian in practice i believe just about everyone who fall into this category would accept the apostle  s creed 3 the next level be an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition which include all of the major strand of christianity but excludes group that be felt to be outside    historic christianity    this be of course a slippery enterprise since catholic could argue that protestant be outside historic christianity etc but i think the most commonly accepted definition would be base on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon the attempt be to characterize doctrine that all major strand of christianity agree be key obviously this be to some extent a matter of judgement a mormon will regard the lds church a a major strand and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their belief but i think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance 4 finally some people use definition that i would say be limited to a specific christian tradition e g some evangelicals only consider someone christian if he have have an evangelical style conversion experience and some even heard of group that limit it to their specific church i think you can find context where each of these definition be use a lot be go to depend upon the purpose use it for if use it descriptively e g in history or anthropology probably use definition 1 or 2  if use it normatively i e to say what you believe the christian message be probably use a definition like 3 or even 4

 perhaps because there be a connection here that be not there in the mexican variant you bring up that be many not all extreme fundamentalist christian use the excuse of teach their child biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment i do not see many mexican use their mexican heritage a an excuse for abuse it be indeed this judgemental control legalism of many fundamentalist christian that have lead me to reject that branch of our faith a not true to the gospel of christ the gospel of love i have see this sort of thing too often even amoung my own relative to believe there be no relationship judgementalism often lead to overly strict and thus abusive discipline of child this be not restrict to just christian fundamentalism it be found in many extreme sect of other legalistic religion i too be a christian but i do not condone the use of the bible to justify this sort of abuse i believe that it be only by expose the horror of the misapplication of the biblical concept of discipline that such abuse can be stop just because someone be also a christian do not mean we must identify eith them this sort of sin need to be make public

 paul repeatedly talk about the    thorn    in his side some think it refers to lust others pride but who know whatever the thorn be apparently it be not compatible with christianity yet do that make his epistle any less paul mention his    thorn    skolops actually a sharp stake in 2 corinthian 12 7 9 and to keep me from be too elate by the abundance of revelation a thorn be give me in the flesh a messenger of satan to harass me to keep me from be too elate three time i besought the lord about this that it should leave me but he say to me    my grace be sufficient for you for my power be make perfectr in weakness    he do not explain what it be but it need not have be a moral problem one guess be that paul have a disorder of the eye he ordinarily dictate his letter and then add a personal note and his signature at the end of the letter to the galatian he say    see i be write in large letter with my own hand    or else    see what a long letter i have write with my own hand    if the former translation be adopt it seem that paul could not write in the small script of a practice writer but need to make his letter large and this suggests eye problem again he say to the galatian 4 13 15 you know that it be because of a bodily ailment that i preach the gospel to you at first and although my condition be a trial to you you do not scorn or despise me but receive me a an angel of god     for i bear you witness that if possible you would have plucked out your eye and give them to me perhaps this last line mean simply    you would have do anything for me not withholding your most precious possession your eye    but in that case we would expect some word like    if i have need them       if it be possible    sound a though the bodily ailment be connect with his eye william barclay in his volume on act make a more specific suggestion before paul preach in the highland of galatia he have be preach in the coastal area of asia minor if he have have a malarial attack while there a doctor would have advise him to leave the low country and head for the hill malaria might well have give him both severe headache and blur vision
 welcome hm i get a little queasy around the phrase    morally responsible    perhaps because heard it misuse so many time i remember in college some folk try to argue that a person who be drunk be not morally responsible for his action in general most folk control their dream but perhaps what you do all day and think about have some impact on them hm and not sure what    action    be in a dream but i will note that jesus do seem adamant about the fact that our thought life be at least a important a our action go lightly with this argument we be all morally responsible for  who we are  and dream might well be an important part of that i know a thing about out of body experience have dream some fairly vivid one be an oobe just a very vivid dream i would argue that extreme interest in this sort of phenomenon be a tad risky it be probably much well to think about who jesus be and who we be in relation to that than to cultivate a strong interest in dream unless you feel plague by dream that be painful and out of control then pray about it and or get help what on earth be your definition of    often    i know exactly one case of two people who have substantially the same dream at the same time and a they be brother who have spent the day do the same thing i could see why their dream might be similiar anyway the only    other plane    i know of be the spiritual realm i think  anyone s  dream perhaps outside the occasional prophet  s represent actual action on an alternate plane if they be real action or conscious thought then yes they would have direct moral significance in a different environment then different moral law apply    be my guess of what you say i see the slightest hint in christian writing that one    environment    change the way a person determines what be moral for a christian it  always  come down to    what jesus would have u do    truth i claim to be an expert in dream i  ll note that the bible talk much about dream outside of the realm of god use them to speak to u with the caveat that such message be not always very clear a it warns somewhere in the ot give that i would not give them a lot of attention unless you feel your dream be try to tell you something

 the above article be a good short summary of traditional christian teach concern the death of mary also very good be    re question about the virgin mary    by micheal d  walker he tell the story very well i would like to add that in the eastern orthodox church we celebrate    the dormition or fall asleep of the theotokos the mother of god    the icon for this day show mary lie on a bed surround by the apostle who be weep christ in his resurrect glory be there hold what seem to be a small child this be in fact mary  s soul already with christ in heaven the assumption of mary be one more confirmation for u a christian that christ do indeed conquer death it forshadows the general resurrection on the last day the disciple be not surprised to find mary  s body miss from the grave she be the mother of the savior she be the first of all christian she give birth to the word of god if it be not for her we would not be save this be why we pray in the orthodox church    through the prayer of the theotokos savior save u
 marhaba nabil if we posit two mind in christ the mind of the logo and the mind of the human jesus then we must admit two will a mind be not a mind without a will i know this have be dealt with in past church prnouncements but there be a philosophical problem here that should examine t  v  morris argue that the incarnation can be see like this _____________ mind of logo _______ here the mind of jesus be circumsribed by god the human son god the son have complete access to the human mind mind but the human mind only have access to the mind of god the son when the son allows access this _______ explains why jesus say even he do not know the _____________ time of the kingdom the human will act in accordance with the divine will accord to free human decision but if the human will would have decide differently than what be intend the divine will would have intercede but this be never the case he employ some very interest analogy to support the one person two mind theory the idea of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology and the intrigue idea of be in a dream see yourself act know that be you but also be omniscient the one hypostasis would be the unity of the two mind agree but i be still wait for morris and others to respond to the linger problem of two mind make two person christian analytic philosopher be break new ground in explicate the rationality of theism and the incarnation                                      ted kalivoda tedr athena cs uga edu university of georgia athens institute of high ed
 whitsebd nextwork rose hulman edu bryan whitsell sent in a list of verse which he felt condemn homosexuality ml panix com michael siemon write in response that some of these verse    be use against u only through incredibly perverse interpretation    and that others    simply do not address the issue    remainder of my post delete the moderator then make some comment i would like to address if you be refer to the term    effeminate    and    homosexual    in the above passage i agree that the accuracy of the translation have be challenged however i be simply comment on the charge that it be an    incredibly perverse    interpretation to read this a a condemnation of homosexuality such a charge seem to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that paul intend to condemn homosexuality however i think i can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse therefore i do not believe it be    incredibly perverse    to read it in this way actually i think of the church at all after all a couple have to be married by a minister a secular justice of the peace could do the job and the two people would be married my point be that it be easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage but where in the bible would one get a christian marriage between two people of the same sex and if you do see a biblical basis for same sex marriage how willing would gay christian be to    save themselves    for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship please note that i be not try to imply that gay christian would not be willing to be so monogamous i be genuinely interested in hearing opinion on the subject i have heard comment from gay in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity a one of the main point of be homosexual yet i tend to doubt that gay who want to be christian would advocate such a position so what be the gay view mark
 this idea that the reformer somehow be the first to bring the bible to the people in their own language be a myth many vernacular translation of the bible exist long before the reformation the vulgate bible which be still the official version of the bible for the catholic church be itself a translation in the common i e vulgar    vulgate tongue of it day latin and have exist for about a millenium before the reformation it might also be note that the printing press be not even invent until the same century a that in which the reformation occur

 hi everyone try to find my way to god but find it difficult a i hear god talk to me let me know that he exists and be with me and that he know me and i feel that i possibly get to know him until he do maybe he _is_ talk to me but i just know or understand how to listen some christian tell me that in their opinion the only way to find god be to take a plunge and commit your life to him and you will discover this idea of dive into the totally unknown be a little bit frighten but i have a few question 1 how do you actually commit yourself if i just say    ok god her you go commit my life to you    i really feel that listen at least i be sure that he have so how do one or how do you commit oneself to god 2 in commit myself in this way what do i have to forfeit of my current life what can i no longer do i feel that a  good a many christian and i try to uphold the idea of  loving your neighbour i go round kill people steal etc  and i try not to get jealous of other people in any way and i would say that i keep to the standard of treat other people a well a many christian so what do i have to give up 3 when commit what do i have to do what do it involve what if any burden be i take on 4 so then what  s the general difference before and after i assume that like on your birthday you suddenly feel a year old it suddenly change my life the day i commit myself so what happens 5 how can i be sure that it be the right thing to do how can i find out what the  it in the last sentence actually _is_ thanks very much for all your help in answer these question perhaps e mail would be a well way to reply but up to you

 here a nice story to help explain the virtue of purity innocence and modesty and their importance the most beautiful virtue this story be an excerpt take from the basket of flower by johann christoph von schmid in a certain little market town over a hundred year ago there live an upright and intelligent man name jacob rede he be married to a most virtuous young woman and they live happily in a humble home which be in the midst of a large beautiful val  ley after living many happy year together jacob  s wife die leave him alone with only one friend     his daughter mary even a a child mary be uncommonly pretty but a she grow in year her piety her innocence her modesty and her unfeigned kindne s towards all she come in contact with give to her beauty a rare and peculiar charm her face be light up with a look of such indescribable goodness that it seem almost a though one look upon an angel mary  s great delight be the beautiful garden and her favour  ite flower be the violet the lily and the rise jacob love to point to them a emblem of the virtue most become to her gender when she once early in march brought the first violet to let the modest violet my dear mary be to you an image of humil  ity and of the benevolence that do good in secret it clothes itself in the tender colour of modesty it prefers to bloom in retire grot it fill the air with it fragrance while remain  ing hidden beneath the leaf may you also my dear mary be like the retire violet avoid vain display not seek to attract the public eye but prefer ever to do good in quietude and peace one morning when the rose and lily be in full bloom and the garden appear in it richest array jacob say to his daughter a he point out a beautiful lily which be beam in the morning sun let the lily my dear child be to you the emblem of purity look how beautiful how pure and fair it be the whi  test linen be a nothing compare with the purity of it petal they be like the snow happy the maiden whose heart be a pure and a free from stain but the purest of all colour be also the hardest  5  to preserve pure easily be the petal of the lily soil touch it but carelessly or roughly and a stain be left behind in the same way a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence let the rise my dear mary be to you an emblem of modesty more beautiful than the colour of the rise be the blush that rise to the cheek of a modest girl it be a sign that she be still pure of heart and innocent in thought happy be the maiden whom the suggestion of a thought that be indelicate will cause to blush a she be thus put on her guard against the approach of danger the cheek which readily blush will remain for a long time with their roseate hue while those which fail to blush at the least indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and wan and go before their time to the grave    among the many fruit tree that adorn the garden there be one that be prize above all the others it be an apple tree not much large than a rise bush and stood by itself in the middle of the garden mary  s father have plant it the day that she be born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apple once it blossom earlier than usual and with unusual luxuriance the tree be one mass of blossom mary be so delighted with it that she go every morning a soon a she be dress to look at it once when it be in full bloom she call to her father look father how beautiful be there ever such a lovely mingle of red and white the whole tree look like one huge bunch of flower the next morning she hasten into the garden to feast her eye once more upon the tree but what be her grief to see that the frost have nipped it and destroyed all it flower they be all become brown and yellow and when the sun come forth in it strength they wither and fell to the ground mary wept bitter tear at the sight then say the father thus do sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth oh my child never cease to remember how dreadful it be to be seduce from the path of right behold in the example of the apple tree an image of what would happen if you be to wander from the way if the hope your conduct hitherto have raise in my heart should vanish not merely for a day or year but for life ah then how much more bitter would be the tear which i would shed over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your cheek life would have no joy for me with tear in my eye i should  6  go down sorrowfully to my grave a he spoke the tear stood in his eye mary be deeply move and the word he uttered make so profound an impression upon her mind that she never forgot them under the eye of a father so love and wise and amid the flower of her garden mary grow daily in stature and intelli  gence blooming a a rise pure a a lily and retire a a violet and a full of promise a a tree laden with blossom happy be the old man at all time to behold how plenteously the fruit of his garden reward his diligent toil but with how much more happiness and content do he mark the gracious effect produce upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his pious teach and example jacob plucked several rose and lily tie them together in a bunch and give them to mary with the word the lily and the rise sister flower a they be belong the one to the other both incomparable in their beauty they be ren  dered still more lovely by be together in the same way my dear child be innocence and modesty twin sister of virtue and can not be separate the great and most powerful guardian of purity be the thought of the presence of god
 ezek 22 26 god seem to be upset with the priest who have make no difference between the holy and the profane this brought to my mind a sermon i heard recently in which the speaker say    god  s second name do not begin with a d    refer i believe to use of god  s holy name and title a swear word i be also remind of the experience of moses at the burning bush when god told him    take off your sandal for the place where you be stand be holy ground    these and other text seem to imply that god  s people must treat holy thing differently from other    common    thing or    make a difference    between holy and common thing the obvious question be what make something holy and how be christian primarily suppose to make this difference between holy and common thing e g god  s name the holy spirit the holy bible etc

 after reading the post on this newsgroup for the past 4 month it have become apparent to me that this group be primarily active with liberal catholic new agers and athiests someone might think to change the name to soc religion any or perhaps even soc religion new it might seem to be more appropriate heck flame me catholic gay and i vote for bill clinton on your side since when do conservative protestant old time religion believer get an exclusive francise to christianity christianity be and always have be a diverse and contentious tradition and this group reflect that diversity i fo one be not ready to concede to _any_ group  be they    liberal    or    conservative    catholic protestant or orthodox charismatic or not  the right to claim that they have _the truth_ and everyone else be not    christian
 this be no less logical than the assumption that if something be _not_ in the bible then it _must not_ be do but i really think what say anyway see below what about the letter to philemon in it paul at least hint that a certain slave be release also slavery in those time be not the same a the type of slavery we have in the u s  i think a well comparison would be to indenture servitude i really want to get into a discussion on slavery anyway although it do demonstrate your point i think it be relevent because the original poster do not say that absence of specific condemenation prof something be not immoral back to the original poster  s assertion he be not in fact make the logical error of which you accuse him he state the fact that the bible do not say that baby can not be baptize also we know that the bible say that _everyone_ must be baptize to enter heaven _everyone_ include infant unless there be other scripture to the contrary i e an exception since there be no exception list in the bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the bible mean what it say that _everyone_ must be baptize to enter heaven and so we baptize infant to summarize you accuse the original poster of say if something be not forbidden by the bible then that prof it be ok i e if something can not be disproven it be true he rather seem to be assert that since the bible do not forbid _you can not prove_ use the bible that it be _not_ ok  there be a difference between prove whether or not something can be proven or disproven there be theory on provability in the field of logic by the way and actually prove or disprove it the other logical error we must avoid fall into be the converse that if something can not be proven then it be false this seem to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believer i think the only thing that can be proven here be that one can not use scripture alone to prove something either way about infant baptism although the evidence seem to me to favor it
 like we have never heard of or read these verse before how about you read them in context take into consideration the time and place in which they be write the local custom and pagan ritual what the surround verse be talk about and how they interact with the rest of the bible there be many issue in the bible that be argue and can be argue successfullly from both side of an issue some example that come to mind be gift of the spirit when the rapture will occur pre or post tribulation how people should be baptize to name a few i have found nothing in scripture that condemns me or anyone else for have a monogamous relationship with the person whom i love even if we be the same sex sorry if i be come across a heat just that the lord have be so dear to me the last several year and tire of hearing this same old thing from people who believe what their told rather than find out for themselves check it out for yourself invite the holy spirit to guide you if i confident of this i invite you to do this

 the catholic doctrine of predestination do not exclude free will in any way since god know everything he therefore know everything that be go to happen to u we have free will and be able to change what happens to u however since god know everything he know all the choice we will make    in advance    god be not subject to time too often argument pit predestination against free will we believe in both
 it might be interest for folk to know that the church of scotland also a presbyterian church manage to    agree to disagree    over woman  s ordination for 25 year the reason be that congregation be free to call whoever they wish and that minister and session choose elder if a congregation do not wish to have a woman they be not oblige to and if a session do not wish to they could not be force to note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the congregation be very important here this year be the 150th annivarsary of the disruption where the church split on that very issue they get back together for almost 80 year a couple of year ago on the 25 anniversary of the allow of woman ordination the position be change so that in theory all minister and elder must recognise that woman can be ordain in theory a minister who refuse to ordain a woman to his session or refuse to work with a woman minister in presbytery could be discipline in practice this have not happen and i believe it be unlikely to happen my personal view be that the new legislation be a mistake and that the permissive but not prescriptive legislation work very well we be go to start go round the homosexual debate at next year assembly at this year a motion be put to ban the blessing of same sex couple after an edinburgh minister do so our panel on doctrine be currently look at marriage and will report next year the matter will be consider and debate then hope this be interest
 ites i realize that my generalization would probably have problem under scrutiny from various asian point of view they need to be discuss in detail indeed but for the purpose of this newsgroup and thread thus far and in this newsgroup i risk oversimpli  fication my main purpose be to emphasize that i be not come from a buddhist or hindu point of view a you observe the main context be that of christianity but by all mean add comment and correction a you find them i write a longer reply address some of your point but decide to not post it perhaps it would be more appropriate for soc religion eastern instead i just add the follow couple of item about karma and reincarnation a i see the matter from an anthroposophical and a christian point of view 1  karma be not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a    judging deity    2  reincarnation be not the same a be born again 3  reincarnation be not the same a the resurrection of the body 4  reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teaching of christianity about god the fall the be incarnation death and resurrection of christ his come again sin grace forgiveness salvation and the last judgement origen  s work be mostly lose he be not anathematize to my knowledge but his write come down largely in fragment and quotation from enemy perhaps someone else can comment on origen i know if there be a specific statement about reincarnation from him but from what i do know about him he probably do hold to the teach in one form or another i know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in the church however i heard an interest story about pope john paul ii from an astronomer who teach at the university of cracow the pope like to go to poland for a scientific conference every couple of year so he can relax and talk polish to friend and fellow countryman my acquaintance an anthroposophist related the fact that woitila knew about steiner and anthroposophy from his early day before he become a priest he be an actor in a dramatic company in cracow whose leader be a pupil of steiner and base his act and direct method on steiner  s indication part of the work be the study of the basic work of anthroposophy well go to this conference with him a few year ago the astronomer and another polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the pope what he thought about anthroposophy they chickened out at the last minute but one of them do ask him what he thought about reincarnation the pope smile and say    actually there have be quite a few good catholic who believe in reincarnation    and he proceed to name several from the early time to modern time then he change the subject my polish friend do not say whether origen be among those he mention gerry palo 73237 2006 compuserve com

 luke 16 talk about the rich man and lazarus matthew 25 talk about the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angel revelation 20 and 21 reference this fire a the place where unbeliever be thrown matthew 18 talk about be thrown into the eternal fire and the fire of hell it seem quite clear that there be this place where a fire burn forever from the revelation passage it be clear that the devil and his angel will be torment there forever from the matthew 25 passage it seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbeliever be everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual from dale  s question i come away with the suggestion that hell if it be short might be an acceptable alternative to living forever with the source of life peace and joy i e the unbeliever cease to exist whereas if punishment go on continually then one should have a great motivation to avoid it it definately seem to me that hell be something we want to avoid regardless of it exact nature there seem to be two main question in dale  s thought what be god  s main plan on earth why be continual punishment a necessary part of hell a oppose to simply destroy completely those who refuse god i believe that god  s main plan be to have a genuine relationship with people the nature of hell and the reason for it nature seem a lot more difficult to ascertain it do seem clear that hell be something to avoid at a minimum hell be the state one be in when one have nothing to do with god in the bible i be not aware of any discussion about the specific of hell beyond the general of hot unpleasant and torment for instance it be not discuss how if at all the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there be some point at which the pain sense ability be burn up if you can forgive the graphicalness if you throw a physical body into a fire assume the person start out alive at some fairly quick point the nerve be destroyed and pain be no longer sense it be not state what occurs when at the judgement the unbeliever who be already physically dead be cast into hell i e they no longer have a physical body so they feel physical pain what could be sense continually be that those in hell be to be forever without god the lazarus rich man parable be told with the idea of have the listener think in physical term in order to get the point that some people listen to god even after he rise from the dead the point of the parable be to reach the hard hearted here who be not listen to the fact of the resurrection nor the gospel about jesus christ it seem reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell be not even remotely pleasant

 i think joe be say any such thing however your question on    ask jesus to come into your heart    seem to imply that infant be not allow to have christ in theirs why must baptism always be view by some people a a sort of    prodigal son    type of thing i e a sudden change of heart go from not accept christ to suddenly accept christ why people start out with christ from shortly after birth and build their relationship from there after all do a man suddenly meet a woman and then marry her that same day from my experience learn that all relationship must be built include one  s relationship with god also joe be speak from the standpoint that baptism be not just a ritual but that through it god bestows sacramental grace upon the recipient certainly for those with the mental faculty to know christ it be necessary to believe in him however the sacrament itself bestows grace on the recipient and make a permanent mark of adoption into god  s family on the soul

 just a quick comment a a baptist clergyperson i find the idea of such a    baptism    if the news report be in fact accurate and they seldom be regard religion offensive the pastor here seem to have a most unbaptist view of baptism  one that seem to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice be absent we do baptize convert but no one who have be deceive into hearing the word be likely to be a convert if in fact the grace of god might work in such a situation there be no harm do in wait a day or two baptist believe in regenerate membership do this church include these half baked at best convert into their church fellowship or do they somehow feel there be some validity in dunk them and turn them loose this kind of    evangelism    be certainly not baptist and probably not very christian either

 jwindley cheap cs utah edu jay windley writes         this be curious i read in _eh_        the lord impart the gift of knowledge to james the just to john and peter after his resurrection these deliver it to the rest of the apostle and they to the seventy of whom barnabas be one       eusebius _ecclesiastical history_ it seem that the lord impart the gift of knowledge not that the lord impart secret information     afraid that i can not find this portrayal in _eh_ i see anywhere in 3 32 7 8 where eusebius mention that certain gnostic have the wrong gnosis the closest be when eusebius summarizes hegesippus statement        whilst if there be any at all that attempt to pervert the sound doctrine of the save gospel they be yet skulk in dark retreat           favorably interpret    just in look at two of the four reference that you give i have the _eh_ handy irenaeus and the _clemetine recognitions_ i will have to look for i see no room for such  interpretations and any such  interpretation still fall short of an equivalence to the temple ceremony the link for jay  s use _eh_ for support be    impart the gift of knowledge       impart secret information       be give secret sign and token to gain entrance to heaven    but there be not enough equivalence between the the idea for u to be able to call this    favorable interpretation    it appear to be closer to    fabrication

 arrogance be arrogance it be not the result of religion it be the result of people know or firmly believe in an idea and one  s desire to show others of one  s rightness i assume that god decide to be judge for our sake a much a his own if we allow him who be kind and merciful be the judge probably be well off than if others judged u or we judged ourselves not sure i agree with this 100 i agree that arrogance be not the result of religion and that god be a far well judge than we be i also agree if you mean to say that arrogance show up in the form of try to prove one s superior knowledge rightness or holiness over another person  s belief i need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that i do not fall into the mistake of misrepresent your view if i fall down in this area i hope you will forgive me arrogance be not the result of believe one be right or of believe that one  s god be great than the god  s of others or of believe that one s religion be well than other religion these be all naturally self implied belief it be self contradictory to say that i believe my current belief to be wrong be i to find myself in error my belief would naturally change and follow what i believe to be right therefore i must always consider my belief correct not arrogance unavoidable behavior it be nonsense to say that i believe another person  s god to be great than my god be his or her god great i be obligate to change so that their god would become my god we be naturally obligate to worship that god which we deem to be the great why should we feel obligate to worship a second best god for the sake of feel humble arrogance be not necessarily think onesself to be well look or more intelligent or strong or have more resource than another person no doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile be passive observation of one  s superior point arrogance then god would be most arrogant of all humility do not rest in slander or belittling god  s work of creation in our life people often go around try to be humble say to one another    not very smart poor not good look just a worm in the ground such a weak person and although i want to sin i really can not help it    be this person truely humble he would take a different approach    god thank you for make me the way you do i know that you never do anything second best yet with all that you have give me i have be so unthankful give me power to resist the devil i have not use it but have indulge myself in do exactly what you have say not to do i have slander your creation in my life and have credit myself with humility for do so lord with all give me i have be completely unfaithful and i do not deserve your forgiveness and yet your love for me be so boundless that you would give yourself to die for me to save me a terribly evil a i be i deserve to go straight to hell yet it plea you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life lead lord please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that i can bring glory to your name instead of insult lord so sorry for my wrong please help me to change    i think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because they want to be wrong if i find someone arrogant i typically have anything to do with them for me often found it hard to tell the difference often time the most humble christian have come across to me a arrogant while the most proud    worm in the ground    false humility type person have be found to be most comfortable company when wrong and arrogant about my wrongness i certainly feel like be confront by my wrongness be someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their fault and charge them with hypocricy for what they say to me at the root my desire would be to make them shut up so that i can go about living my life arrogantly a i wish however be someone to confront me silently by their example earn my respect and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private feel broken down and challenged to seek god for help in change from the error of my way the hard part be get to the point to where i can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride    regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity    regardless of whether onlooker will frown down upon me or not it easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one  s ability to serve god easy to cast aside any hope of reach true humility and merely hide behind slander god  s creation in our life instead but we should examine ourselves i hope i typed this back in right and why we react to certain situation with such emotion for instance many of u feel    justified    to be insult by an arrogant person a if we need a reason to feel insult but after be insult over and over again by the word of others think either toughen up or decide not to be insult or ignore the insult just because you can justify feeling of anger or insult or outrage that make that reaction the appropriate one it be in this light of self examination that we can change our emotional reaction sometimes it help when we can understand and feel the difference between what be a true statement of our character and what be a false and slanderous statement of our character the devil be the accuser of the bretheren he would love u to feel hopelessly guilty where we be innocent and feel arrogant and self righteous where we be indeed wrong the devil  s aim be to get u into a much misery a he can just think of the devil a a cruel and merci  less criminal who torment a parent by burning his or her child with hot iron the way the devil get under the father  s skin be by hurt those that the father love so much                                                                                                                i deplore the horrible crime of child murder     we want prevention not merely punishment we must reach the root of the evil     it be practice by those whose inmost soul revolt from the dreadful deed     no mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffer the unborn innocent the woman be awfully guilty who commits the deed     but oh thrice guilty be he who drove her to the desperation which impel her to the crime
 like to field this one if i may although i be a believer in and follower of christ my experience with religion be all that positive in fact there be one point in my life when for about three day i simply __ believe in the existence of god anyway when i look back upon the trouble have they seem to fall into two category    impulse to unbelief that result from logical contradiction and impulse to unbelief that result from frustration with god the first category occur to me much anymore a i have work through most of the argument for the non existence of god but way back when these would cause me some problem and i would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe i can see where others less stubborn than i and i do mean stubborn stubborness have often be the only thing stand between me an atheism from time to time would fail the second category arises out of some long term personal difficulty and the struggle to live my life a god would have me live it without living my life a others would tell me how god would have me live it a good example of this be my struggle with the more radical christian i meet i be not nor have i ever be    on fire for chirst    and i think i ever want to be nevertheless i be not    lukewarm    about my faith so i really fit in with the mainstream either quite naturally i feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within christian society and it can lead to a lot of internal tension when i want to do what i _know_ be right but when another part of me believe that what i want to do be wrong because all the other christian think so to quite naturally this tension have a destructive effect on my relationship with god and during all of this internal strife there  s atheism sit there like the promise land    no rule no responsibility no need to live up to anyone  s expectation but my own complete freedom of course all an illusion but nevertheless a very appeal illusion especially when the so called    people of god    be behaving like total twit i can easily understand why someone would go that route and would be hostile to ever come back imho many of the former christians turned atheists who are now actively  hostile to christianity be so because their experience with christ and god a very peaceful one but one of mind control and    shut up and do what   told because we know what s best for you because    god s will and   to young to know what god s will is yet    courtesy of some of christ s more overzealous follower a final reason why people become atheist be because christian do not have a very good reputation right now one of the thing that attract people to christianity in the ancient day be the love that christian obviously have for one another and the world around them unlike the rest of the world christian community actively care for their poor and the christian rich do not trod on the back of their poorer brother but bent down to help them christian be know for living exemplary life even if they be thought to be traitor to the state because they sacrifice to the emporer nowadays courtesy of the medium and some christian leader who lose christ on their way to power people see christian a sexually repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view there be a lot more reason why people become atheist but i have time to go into them right now

 my understand that the u s  supreme court have never give a legal definition of religion this despite the many case involve religion that have come before the court can anyone verify or falsify this have any state or other government try to give a legal definition of religion accord to the legal practice of today  s america i imagine the legal definition of religion if define may resemble the follow    any system of belief or practice to which people be commit for the benefit of society which must in the opinion of secular thought be isolated from political and educational influence       should any system of belief or practice to which people be commit be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the opinion of religious thought a define in the previous paragraph isolation of such from political and educational influence would constitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of civil right

 not scriptural but come from the patristic age i think something about    amare errantem interficere errorem    which sound more like    love the errant slay the error    no doubt someone else will know in particular who mint the phrase if i have to guess blame st augustine who seem to have have a gift for aphorism

 sorry i put my foot in my mouth concern the church  s history it be correct to say that the council of hippo 393 list the deuterocanonical book among those accepted for use in the church and that this be ratify by the council of carthage and by pope innoent i and gelasius i 414 ad    at the end of the fourth century view still differ in regard to the extent of the canon or the number of the book which should be acknowledge a divine and authoritative the jewish canon or the hebrew bible be universally receive while the apocrypha add to the greek version of the septuagint be only in a general way account a book suitable for church reading and thus a a middle class between canonical and strictly apocryphal pseudonymous writing and justly for those book while they have great historical value and fill the gap between the old testament and the new all originate after the cessation of prophecy and the can not be therefore regard a inspire nor be they ever cite by christ or the aposteles       in the western church the canon of both testament be close at the end of the fourth century through the authority of jerome who waver however between critical doubt and the principle of tradition and more especially of augustine who firmly follow the alexandrian canon of the septuagint and the preponderant tradition in reference to the catholic epistle and the revelation though he himself in some place incline to consider the old testament apocrypha a  deutero  canonical bearing a subordinate authority    this history go on to say that augustine attend both the council of hippo and of carthage it be interest to note however the follow footnote to the fourth session of the council of trent the footnote list various synod which endorse list of canonical book but then say    the tridentine list or decree be the first  infallible  and effectually promulgate declaration on the canon of the holy scripture    which lead one to think that the rc canon be not official until trent thus my previous erroneous statement be not entirely groundless it be also interest to note that the council of trent go on to uphold    the old latin vulgate edition    of the scripture a authentic which i would suppose today  s catholic scholar wish the council have never say also the council make no distinction between deutero canonical and canonical book    in contrast to eerdman  s statement of the fourth century view
 while this be essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of christianity gerry palo have make some comparison to asian religious belief on this topic which have simplify the asian idea of karma to the point of misrepresentation there be significant difference in the idea of karma among hindu jains buddhist and even among the various buddhist tradition to refer to karma a a system of reward for past deed be totally incorrect in the buddhist and jain tradition karma be consider to be a moral process in which intention either good or evil shape a person  s predilection for future intention and action and produce a person who be more prone to good than evil or the opposite       reward    have nothing to do with it both jainism and buddhism be atheistic so there be no deity to dispense reward or punishment karma be usually described in term of seed and reap the fruit thereof in fact    a you sow so shall you reap    be found in the pali canon a i recall the metaphor of natural growth be explicit hinduism or some sect in that tradition be i believe much more deterministic and involve concept closer to reward and punishment be theistically inclined in point of fact the theravadin buddhist tradition of southeast asia considers karma a only one of five influence in human life and in fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanic of karma without the element of free will also in eastern religion there be a difference between reincarnation and rebirth which be essentially absent in western consideration origen usually cite a the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation among christian thinker what be his view and how do he relate them to the christian scripture
 this be too often true many people try to place this a a    high    sin however     a big part of the problem be that many of the homosexual and people advocate acceptance of homosexuality in church do not consider active homosexuality a sin i often see the attitude of    forgive me and i will try to change    instead i see    there  s nothing wrong with my life and i can be a good christian so it must be you who have an illness because you accept me    christian can and will accept homosexual just a they will accept  any  sinner sure it may be natural to some people to be homosexual but it be also perfectly natural for everyone to sin i be born with a desire to sin but i work to prevent myself from sin much less common now but i  still  have urge to lash out in anger there also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desire or ever so it be sad to see people leave the church when they be discourage that they be still homosexual after several year
 my feel on baptism be this parent baptize their baby so that the baby have the sanctify grace of baptism and thus removal of original sin on it soul in the event of an unexpected death that be the parent speak on behalf of the child which be too young to speak on it own this should not surprise anyone parent  always  do what they believe be the best for their baby why would that apply to the baby  s physical need only but not his her spiritual need to have god  s grace the purpose of confirmation be for the baby now young adult to decide to re affirm for himself herself the promise that his her parent make at baptism that be where accept jesus into your heart come in in baptism the parent ask jesus to come into their baby  s heart at confirmation the child repeat that request independently
 i have be study the bible now for about a year i love it but i be not very familiar with the different denomination or tradition or common belief of various christian group i have heard various people outside this news group describe  idols  such a power money material possession etc these thing be worship in some sense i suppose but i never really give idol much thought until now     i have be reading the posting in this news group which i just found a few day ago and i have a question     first not try to question anyone  s belief or try to push my view on anyone else i be at this long enough to have any view other than i can not get to heaven by be good i must understand that christ bore my sin on the cross so that i could be save and i need to repent i e realize that every time i sin i might a well stick a sharp stick in christ  s side because he take the punishment for my sin when he die on the cross in my study mary never really come up i know who she be but about it it seem to me that a statue of mary could be consider an idol do people pray to statue of mary it sound like educate christian more educate than myself sure believe mary be sinless wow     i hop to spend the summer convincing myself one way or the other about tongue reading    charismatic chaos    i guess i  ll study tongue in parallel with reading this news group any help you can give me will be appreciate                                                                i think the issue be so much that people be more educate than you though it may well be that they be a that they come from a different tradition than yours this be a discussion between catholic and protestant catholic generally believe that mary be sinless protestant do not the issue come down to different source of authority protestant generally limit themselves to the bible a a source of doctrine since this in the bible except in passage that no one would understand in this way if they already believe it protestant accept it catholic see continue revelation through the church though they believe the result be consistent with the bible i interpret your post not a a call for yet another argument about whether the catholic marian devotion be idolatry an argument i be not prepared to see newed here but a a sign of be interested in learn about tradition other than your own catholic be of course a major one but by no mean the only one i generally consider the major tradition to be catholic orthodox and various subset of protestantism within protestantism a matter of how finely you want to cut thing these day i think the major division be between those who accept biblical inerrancy and those who there be also a number of major historical tradition but in recent decade distinction be tend to blur identify the major protestant tradition a lutheran reform anglican sort of halfway between catholic and protestant wesleyan baptist holiness pentecostal church of christ but there be a number of others historical distinction tend not to be so important among the liberal church anymore and i think current trend in society and the church be also tend to make conservative see themselves a ally from a general    evangelical    perspective but difference among these various tradition be still quite marked i think the best introduction to these issue be to read a good book on church history anyone who want to understand the church really need to understand how we get where we be now a church history will normally show you where each of these tradition come from and give a feel for their nature unfortunately away from my library at the moment so i have anything specific to recommend
     that brings up an interest question if this interpretation be correct how would these people be get into heaven before jesus open the gate of heaven
 a christian friend of mine once reason that if we be never create we could not exists therefore we be create and therefore there exists a creator i hesitate to comment on the validity of this because i do not know what your friend meant by it if he meant that whatever exists must have be create then he be open to the obvious retort that god exists and so god must have be create perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there be a time when we do not exist and therefore something other than ourselves must have brought u into existence this seem plausible but an atheist might reply    so my parent engender me so what    here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of cause be not a satisfactory explanation he would have some support from philosopher who be not ordinarily consider religious ayn rand and some others who be in the tradition of aristotle have argue for a first cause he would have to bridge the gap between say entity and the god of abraham if he merely asserts that the thing we observe be ultimately dependent on thing radically unlike them few physicist would disagree
 hello i just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country i be not sure if it be go on also here in the u or any other country in all these 4 1 2 yr be here in illinois usa i have not encounter it may i just call it    travel fatima    since i know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language for certain region in a district in a town or city an image  statue of our lady of fatima be move from one home originate from owner to another this will stay with that family for one 1 week and this family be require to pray the rosary and other prayer prayer sheet accompany the image to our lady of fatima the move will be like a simple procession of folk pick up the image from it current  home after  departing  prayer and proceeds to move it to the next home which have the prior notification about the move there will be the  receiving  prayer at the next home to welcome our lady of fatima image there it do not have to be that only member of the family in that home who must pray to the image they may invite others or others friends can invite themselves in to participate during prayer time in that  new home everyday for one week this image be move from one family to the next within the bound region of that district until it go back to the owner of the image this be probably go on around there philippine right now or somebody correct me when exactly since i forgot and every year this be part of our devotion to our lady of fatima it have be easy to facilitate this back home because it be more likely that your next door neighbor be a catholic and the image then be just move next door i be think of start something like it in the village where my sister and her family life most of our friend and neighbor there be catholic and practice one like to know if there be any state community law that this practice will violate whatsoever before i go for it thank you for any comment or help about this matter

 this be a continuation of an earlier post i be sorry you found this offensive it be not my intent to offend i be lead up to another point which i discus in more detail below i can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for homosexuality certainly if i spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality nobody would have any trouble label me a homophobe let me ask this gently why be you so judgemental of other people  s sexual preference what happen to    no doubt i be free to do anything    i think you have a serious double standard here when you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality a    slimey    and    sleazy    you be make an implicit judgement that bestiality be pervert sinful disgust unnatural    in short all the thing that society once thought about homosexuality not all people share your view you claim not to know any sincere zoophiles but this do not mean that they do not exist they even have their own newsgroup alt sex bestiality be you go to accuse them all of be mere    joker    i notice you delete the main point of my comment the fact that the only biblical condemnation of bestiality occur in connection with the levitical prohibition against homosexuality while there be some new testament passage that can arguably be take a condemn homosexuality there be none that condemn bestiality one of your main point seem to be that christian homosexuality be acceptable due to the lack of any    clear    new testament statement against it if this be a valid argument then should not christian zoophilia be make that much more acceptable by the fact that the new testament make no reference clear or unclear to the subject at all i be quite serious here if i be go to accept homosexuality a biblically acceptable on the basis of your argument then i be go to be fair and apply the same standard to everyone else  s declare sexual preference a well if the argument you make for homosexuality can be apply to other sexual preference a well go to apply them and see what come up not try to    torpedo a serious issue    by use what you label    a ridiculous joke    i post a question about how we should interpret biblical guideline for christian sexuality and i think such a question be    irrelevant    in a group call    soc religion christian    the bible discus homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context and therefore i feel i have a good precedent for do the same i know whether it make any difference but for the record this be not a side issue for me i believe love one another include not encourage people to defile themselves therefore it be of high importance to determine whether god regard certain sexual act a defile i can read in the new testament that    god have join together    heterosexual couple and that the marriage bed be undefiled i can read in the old testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person be under the law if gay christian can validly put aside the old testament standard of defilement then i want to know so that i can fairly apply it to all the sexual practice that defile a person in the old day i think right to take just bit and piece of the law and try and apply them to christian today e g bestiality still defile you but homosexuality that be pretty much what you say earlier right you use different example but i think you say essentially the same thing about it be wrong to apply only certain part of the law to christian it be not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction i personally get all that upset discuss alternative to the monogamous heterosexual orientation afraid i naively assume that others would have a similar attitude please note that i have never intend to equate homosexuality with child abuse i have merely note that for all the lack of    clear    nt condemnation of homosexuality there be an even great lack of nt condemnation or even mention of bestiality a practice which a number of people e g on alt sex bestiality consider to be their true sexual orientation this be an excellent question and i pray that you will not treat it a a mere rhetorical question but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer i recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it a slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientation why do you not apply all the same verse about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexual be it because you automatically experience a subjective feel of revulsion at the thought a lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse be it because you regard the practice a socially unacceptable a lot of people regard homosexuality a socially unacceptable do you feel that it violates the traditional judeo christian standard of sexual morality many people feel that homosexuality do do you feel the bible condemns it many people think the bible say more to condemn homosexuality than it do to condemn bestiality why then do you think compare bestiality with homosexuality be insult to homosexuality if you can honestly answer this question you will have come a long way towards understand why many people feel the same way about homosexuality a you feel about bestiality also please note that i be not in any sense condemn  people  i be merely point out that when i read the bible i see certain sexual  practices  that the bible appear to condemn e g sex outside of marriage when i say i think adultery and pre marital sex be sinful do you take that a me fail to love my neighbor when you treat bestiality a something disgust and unmentionable be you disobey    repeat order not to judge or condemn others    when you say other christian be guilty of sin by condemn you and judging you be you by that accusation make yourself guilty of the same offense or be you and i both simply take note about  practices  the bible brand a sinful and leave the judgement of the  people  up to god not sure what you mean by the above two paragraph if you mean that jesus be the truth and that he accepts sinner and do not reject them then i agree if we be not sinner then we would not  need  a savior our salvation in christ however do not mean that sin be now irrelevant for u and we can now do whatever we want nor do christ  s grace mean that those who refer to sin a    sin    be be judgemental or intolerant i be speak in general term here not specifically about homosexuality if the bible call something    sin    then it be not unreasonable for christian to call it sin too a apply to christian homosexuality i think the only definitive authority on christian sexuality be the bible if you make a list of everything the bible say on the subject of homosexual intercourse i think you will find that every verse on the list be negative and condemn at bad and    unclear    at best the most pro gay statement you could make about the list be that there be some dispute about the new testament verse which many people interpret a condemn homosexual intercourse that be from a gay perspective the most positive thing you can say about the bible  s treatment of homosexuality be that some verse fail to clearly condemn it it jesus declare all food clean the council at jerusalem declare that gentile be not require to keep the ritual law but nobody ever reclassify homosexual intercourse from be an abomination deserve of death to be an accepted christian practice you have verse describe homosexual intercourse a an abomination that defile both jew under the law and gentile not under the law and you have some verse which be at best    not clear    but which some people believe  are  clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior and the sum total of what the bible say about same sex intercourse i can appreciate from personal experience your desire to have everything simple cut and dried black and white what i want  is ok and those who oppose me are wicked however i do not think the bible make your case a definitively a you would like it to in fact i believe it say anything positive about your case at all yes i know the verse about love one another and not judging one another but not really the issue be it you know and admit that there be still thing that be sinful for christian to do since you say it be wrong for christian to condemn you therefore the issue be whether the bible say homosexual intercourse be a sin even if you do challenge the clarity of the new testament verse you be still left with the fact that the only thing the bible do say clearly about homosexual intercourse be that it be an abomination that defile both those who be under the law and those who be not mark

 curiously enough this subject have occupy a good bit of my prayer life recently god  s experience of time be so completely different from our own since he be both within and without it use word like    foreknowledge    and    predestination    be semantically incorrect when it come to describe god  s perception of our action because for god the begin living and end of our life be all the same sort of for god there be no    before    when he do not know so he could not have    foreknowledge    of our life or a time when he could have    predestine    our action in fact since our understand of thing be so tie to our linear experience of time i would say that it be impossible for u to understand completely how our free will interacts with god  s control of the universe
 thanks for the letter your comment help some a to the last comment i certainly realize that it be not intend to sound that way i be still try to understand  how  a spiritual be colud truly be one and three at the same time all of the description of this be either platonic or sound like special plead sort of    they appear to be three seperate being in all way but really they be one trust me    neither of these be acceptible to me the fact be so far the only description of the trinity that make any  sense  to me be the modalistic one such a modalistic monarchianism or    economic trinitarianism    i can accept that the three aspect be intrinsic to the nature of god so i perhaps lean more towards the latter i be try here to see if anybody can come up with another description that be both orthodox and believable    sarima teradata com formerly tdatirv sarima or stanley friesen elsegundoca ncr com
 dave you might like to read a book by florence bulle    god want you rich other entice doctrine    which discus oobes in one of her chapter in the bible we have example of men caught up in the spirit eg ezekiel paul i believe that also this experience be counterfeit by satan so that for example yoga and other eastern medatitive technique can be use to induce the soul to leave the body and float off someone try to sell me a book in los angeles airport entitle    easy journey to other planet    which us such technique the occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body departure the book    the challanging counterfeit    about a former medium who get save tell how the author on his last trance be attack by evil spirit who try to kill him while return to his body at the end of the seance because of his interest in christianity and how he be supernaturally protect by the lord there may be some similarity in mind altering drug and the phenomenon of  tripping a regard the connection between body and soul there be an interest verse in ecclesiastes in a passage talk about old age the preacher writes    then man go to his eternal home and mourner go about the street remember him    before the silver cord be sever    12 5 6 my understand of this silver cord be that it be something that attache body and soul in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an astronaut  s air line to his spaceship when a person go out of body this silver cord still attache the soul whereever it go and be vulnerable to be broken astral projection can be dangerous bulle i think report a case of a yogi off on an oobe who be found dead in his apartment with no apparent external cause
 no it be very relevant homosexual act and act of beastiality be topically aranged together in the law this be very important anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deal with temple prostitution and i think you would agree that there be no proof for this if the law reveals the character of god and be    holy just and good    a be write in the new testament then those who consider we who be against commit homosexual act to be biggots have to address this passage of scripture why must we only discus scripture that involve consensual human adult relationship that bordering on sophistry the point we be make be that god do not ordain certain kind of sex act not everyone who brings up these scripture be just try to use and emotional argument that compare homosexual to beastophiles and child molestors the issue we be deal with be that some sex act be ungodly i do not have problem with a love nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex i have them and we all do the issue at hand be the sinfulness have sex with member of the same sex or lust after so other forbidden sex act be a valid topic for conversation and the idea that these relationship may be emotional relationship between adult human be red herring we all agree that it be okay for adult to have care relationship with one another
 be you sure you want to include chalcedon here i presume that you mean the description of jesus a fully human and fully devine almost everyone would consider the majority of copt and armenian and the jacobite a christian yet for 15 century it have be maintain that they disagree with the formula of chalcedon those that consider them christian be most likely to object that these community require a personal commitment to jesus which be only tangentially related to the formula of chalcedon    thanks john kolassa kolassa bio1 bst rochester edu

cheapest book i could find to buy be the  50 and 1 00 book by hagin and others consequently i begin receive hagin  s monthly magazine and they still send it to me and also copeland  s also still sent to me it until i read a booklet by jimmy swaggart call _hyper faith the new gnosticism_ that i begin to realize the teaching i be partake of be error i start reading the bible more and study more sure enough jimmy be right in many point a part of my experience i be alert christian particularly new christian that these teaching be heretical and they need to do a the bereans do in act 17 11 check these teaching out with scripture 2 my brother in law be involve in a word faith    cult    in my area leader be real good friend with benny hinn rather then go into much detail about this suffice it to say he be deceive mistreat and have now fall into atheism still pray for him phil 1 6 3 the assistant pastor at the church i teach adult sunday school in have be a follower of copeland for 15 year

jesus become sin take on the very nature of the devil and become one with him b  jesus death on the cross enough to atone c  jesus be drag to hell after his death be beat and abuse by satan and demon thus finish our atonement satan be ruling over him there d  jesus be born again in hell e  jesus die spiritually lose his divinity and reassumed it after the resurrection f  we be god these be heresy

tremendous documentation and insight zane        i have a nice scriptural answer for why i believe it be at best un  profitable for christian to engage in this type of activity heresy hunt    my reply     why do you call it    heresy hunt       hunt    implies it readily accessible or available this movement be the fast grow movement in christendom hagin have sell over 40 million book and booklet hinn have sell more book in the last couple of year than swindoll and dobson combine fred price have the large church in term of seat capacity in the usa sound like much    hunt    be need it be scriptural to expose doctrinal error i give some verse to you before more can be give most of the epistle be write due to error doctrinal practical in the church the early church have numerous council to expose error and heresy not a new thing remember luther zane        i would like to point out though that historically those who hunt heretic often end up cause a big mess than the heretic     but this be my un  document opinion    my reply     1 if you can provide documentation it would be appreciate 2 read ephesian 4 11 16 esp v 13 and 14 and tell me what cause disunity and immaturity in the body eph 4 13 14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we should no longer be child toss to and fro and carry about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plot     disunity contrary to popular opinion cause by expose error cause by error zane        there be many who probably give no place for see the scripture a document a spiritual development or growth in it writer but i would suggest that the fiery paul of the letter to the galatian mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of love in the end    my reply     most scholar believe paul write 2 timothy last let  s examine his admonition to tim to ascertain how mellow he have become     2ti 1 13 15 hold fast the pattern of sound word which you have heard from me in faith and love which be in christ jesus that good thing which be commit to you keep by the holy spirit who dwells in u this you know that all those in asia have turn away from me among whom be phygellus and hermogenes 2ti 2 15 18 be diligent to present yourself approve to god a worker who do not need to be ashamed rightly divide the word of truth but shun profane and idle babbling for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus be of this sort who have strayed concern the truth say that the resurrection be already past and they overthrow the faith of some 2ti 2 24 26 and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correct those who be in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their sens and escape the snare of the devil have be take captive by him to do his will 2ti 3 6 9 for of this sort be those who creep into household and make captive of gullible woman load down with sin lead away by various lust always learn and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now a jannes and jambres resist moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt mind disapprove concern the faith but they will progress no far for their folly will be manifest to all a theirs also be 2ti 3 12 17 yes and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution but evil men and impostor will grow bad and bad deceive and be deceive but you must continue in the thing which you have learn and be assure of know from whom you have learn them and that from childhood you have know the holy scripture which be able to make you wise for salvation through faith which be in christ jesus all scripture be give by inspiration of god and be profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equip for every good work 2ti 4 2 5 preach the word be ready in season and out of season convince rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teach for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but accord to their own desire because they have itch ear they will heap up for themselves teacher and they will turn their ear away from the truth and be turn aside to fable but you be watchful in all thing endure affliction do the work of an evangelist fulfill your ministry 2ti 4 14 15 alexander the coppersmith do me much harm may the lord repay him accord to his work you also must beware of him for he have greatly resist our word zane        the picture i have of paul be not of one who go out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolf     but of one who teach the sheep with many tear the necessity of absolutely not allow themselves to be transform into wolf to protect themselves    my reply     act 20 26 31    therefore i testify to you this day that i be innocent of the blood of all men    for i have not shun to declare to you the whole counsel of god    therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which the holy spirit have make you overseer to shepherd the church of god which he purchase with his own blood    for i know this that after my departure savage wolf will come in among you not spar the flock    also from among yourselves men will rise up speak perverse thing to draw away the disciple after themselves    therefore watch and remember that for three year i do not cease to warn everyone night and day with tear zane        for all the warn paul do it be of note that he never once drop a name of a wolf     but i will admit he cry in his beard at the end over those who have abandon him everyone in asia it    my reply     paul mention name     1ti 1 18 20 this charge i commit to you son timothy accord to the prophecy previously make concern you that by them you may wage the good warfare have faith and a good conscience which some have reject concern the faith have suffer shipwreck of whom be hymenaeus and alexander whom i deliver to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme 2ti 1 15 this you know that all those in asia have turn away from me among whom be phygellus and hermogenes 2ti 2 16 18 but shun profane and idle babbling for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus be of this sort who have strayed concern the truth say that the resurrection be already past and they overthrow the faith of some 2ti 4 10 for demas have forsaken me have love this present world and have depart for thessalonica    crescens for galatia titus for dalmatia 2ti 4 14 15 alexander the coppersmith do me much harm may the lord repay him accord to his work you also must beware of him for he have greatly resist our word so do john     3jo 1 9 10 i write to the church but diotrephes who love to have the preeminence among them do not receive u therefore if i come i will call to mind his deed which he do prate against u with malicious word and not content with that he himself do not receive the brother and forbids those who wish to put them out of the church jesus also single out teaching and doctrine     rev 2 14 16    but i have a few thing against you because you have there those who hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to put a stumble block before the child of israel to eat thing sacrifice to idol and to commit sexual immorality    thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate  repent or else i will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth rev 2 20 23    nevertheless i have a few thing against you because you allow that woman jezebel who call herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servant to commit sexual immorality and eat thing sacrifice to idol    and i give her time to repent of her sexual immorality and she do not repent    indeed i will cast her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deed    i will kill her child with death and all the church shall know that i be he who search the mind and heart and i will give to each one of you accord to your work zane        i question too the purpose of those who write book and build ministry on the fault deliberate or otherwise of others maybe if they would wander around in the desert eat locust and honey or barely cake     with no worldly good at stake money to be make or no reputation to maintain     i would question their motif conscious or otherwise less    my reply     i comment on this because it deal with the intangible motif of others but even if they have bad motif remember what paul say     phi 1 15 18 some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely suppose to add affliction to my chain but the latter out of love know that i be appoint for the defense of the gospel what then only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth christ be preach and in this i rejoice yes and will rejoice zane        if we want to be true to the admonition of scripture many of which you list about protect ourselves and the flock from wolf and wind of doctrine i suggest we start by allow the wolf program in our own noetic pasture to be nail to the cross    my reply     please explain zane        secondly i suggest any heresy hunt be restrict to our own fellowship which in the strict scriptural sense be the local city church    my reply     if heresy be not be propagate over the mass medium then it may not be need to go mass medium with the exposure unfortunately heresy be be taught not just in copeland  s church or hagin  s or hinn  s or price  s but all over the radio in print etc no pastor or church leader know what material the sheep be feed on outside the church imperative that leadership be make aware of this and cic do just that also let  s examine a passage of scripture     eph 4 11 and he himself give some to be apostle some prophet some evangelist and some pastor and teacher eph 4 12 for the equip of the saint for the work of ministry for the edify of the body of christ these ministry gift that the lord installs in the church be not just for one individual church but for    the body of christ    paul be an apostle he travel all over distil his message he be also a teacher 1co 4 17 for this reason i have sent timothy to you who be my beloved and faithful son in the lord who will remind you of my way in christ a i teach everywhere in every church 1co 7 17 but a god have distribute to each one a the lord have call each one so let him walk and so i ordain in all the church also 1co 12 28 and god have appoint these in the church first apostle second prophet third teacher after that miracle then gift of healing help administration variety of tongue eph 4 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ notice that the    five fold    ministry be go to be around    till    the church be in    unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man    this i believe will not occur fully until the lord jesus return see 1cor 13 9 12 but god want the body to continue on mature what hinders maturity and unity of the body eph 4 14 that we should no longer be child toss to and fro and carry about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plot clear that false doctrine integrate into the church    by the trickery of men    cause 1 disunity the thing we be strive for and 2 spiritual immaturity the church continue in spiritual childhood when christian be    toss to and fro and carry about with every wind of doctrine    the    five  fold    ministry of which there do not appear to be clear scriptural denominational boundary    pastor    appear responsible for their individual flock be to deal with these doctrine when necessary in their struggle to equip the body all believer be call to do this to a degree     jud 1 3 4 beloved while i be very diligent to write to you concern our common salvation i found it necessary to write to you exhort you to contend earnestly for the faith which be once for all deliver to the saint for certain men have crept in unnoticed who long ago be marked out for this condemnation ungodly men who turn the grace of our god into lewdness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ zane        if notice in scripture the heresy hunter that go from church to church and area to area be the    bad guy    and they go after the    good guy    namely paul who they consider to be the arch heretic    my reply     they be themselves heretic try to discredit paul who be preach contrary to what they taught zane        let  s face it the wolf be here for a reason and we be here for the reason and let  s hope the wolf become sheep and the sheep lamb    my reply     yes 2ti 2 24 26 and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all                  able to teach patient in humility correct those who be in opposition if                                                                               god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and

 let talk about principle if we accept that god set the standard for what ought to be include in scripture then we can ask 1  be it authoritative 2  be it prophetic 3  be it authentic 4  be it dynamic 5  be it receive collect read and use on these count the apocrapha fall short of the glory of god to quote unger  s bible dictionary on the apocrapha 1  they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracy and anachronism 2  they teach doctrine which be false and foster practice which be at variance with sacred scripture 3  they resort to literary type and display an artificiality of subject matter and style out of keep with sacred scripture 4  they lack the distinctive element which give genuine scripture their divine character such a prophetic power and poetic and religious feel but the problem with this argument lie in the assumption that the hebrew canon include the apocrapha in the first place and it until the sixteenth century that luther and co  threw them out the jewish council you mention previously accept them so the reformation protestant have good historical precedence for their action jerome only translate the apocrapha under protest and it be literally  over his dead body that it be include in the catholic canon how do you then view the word    i warn everyone who hears the word of the prophecy of this book if anyone add anything to them god will add to him the plague described in this book and if anyone take away from this book the prophecy god will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city    rev 22 18 9 surely this set the standard and not just man made tradition it be also noteworthy to consider jesus attitude he have no argument with the pharisee over any of the ot canon john 10 31 6 and explain to his follower on the road to emmaus that in the law prophet and psalm which refer to him the ot division of scripture luke 24 44 a well a in luke 11 51 take genesis to chronicle the jewish order we would say genesis to malachi a scripture i be not familiar with the book some other argument you might like to consider be found in chapter 3 of josh mcdowell  s evidence that demand a verdict

 let talk about principle if we accept that god set the standard for what ought to be include in scripture then we can ask 1  be it authoritative    authoritative    be not a quality of the write itself  it be a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the write a normative 2  be it prophetic how be    prophecy    to be define if it be    speak forth    of god  s message much of the apocrypha must surely qualify 3  be it authentic again by what standard be    authenticity    a function of the author the historical accuracy 4  be it dynamic what be this suppose to mean many of the apocryphal book be highly    dynamic     thought provoke faithful even excite 5  be it receive collect read and use by whom of course the apocryphal book be receive by some collect or else we would not have them read and use and they still be in the catholic and orthodox church on these count the apocrapha fall short of the glory of god this be demonstrably false to quote unger  s bible dictionary on the apocrapha 1  they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracy and anachronism so do other book of the bible 2  they teach doctrine which be false and foster practice which be at variance with sacred scripture    false    by whose interpretation those church that accept them find no contradiction with the rest of scripture 3  they resort to literary type and display an artificiality of subject matter and style out of keep with sacred scripture this be a purely subjective evaluation the apocryphal book demonstrate the same category and form of write found in the other scripture in fact one could argue that the apocryphal    addition to the book of esther    act rather to bring the    unscripturelike    book of esther more into line with other book 4  they lack the distinctive element which give genuine scripture their divine character such a prophetic power and poetic and religious feel have you ever read the wisdom of ben sira or the wisdom of solomon they exhibit every bit a much    poetic and religious feel    a psalm or proverb deletion how do you then view the word    i warn everyone who hears the word of the prophecy of this book if anyone add anything to them god will add to him the plague described in this book and if anyone take away from this book the prophecy god will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city    rev 22 18 9 surely this set the standard and not just man made tradition these word clearly be meant to refer to the book of revelation alone not to the whole body of scripture revelation itself be accepted very late into the canon the church simply do not see it a have a primary role of any kind in identify and limit scripture it be also noteworthy to consider jesus attitude he have no argument with the pharisee over any of the ot canon john 10 31 6 and explain to his follower on the road to emmaus that in the law prophet and psalm which refer to him the ot division of scripture luke 24 44 a well a in luke 11 51 take genesis to chronicle the jewish order we would say genesis to malachi a scripture jesus do not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day the canon have not be establish a a close collection the book of the apocrypha be part of the septuagint which be the bible of the early church the hebrew canon be not close until 90 c e the torah pentateuch     law    be establish in jesus day a be the prophet with the _exclusion_ of daniel the writing however be still in flux jesus do not refer to the writing only to the psalm which be part of them the book of the apocrypha be all part of the literature that be eventually sift and separate to argue that jesus be refer to the jewish canonical order in luke 11 51 be weak at best he be not quote scripture but tell a chronological story and a mention above the hebrew canon especially in the present order do not exist a such in jesus day
 ok what  s more important to gay christian sex or christianity christianity i would hope would they be willing to forgo sex completely in order to avoid be a stumble block to others to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong etc if not why not heterosexual abstain all the time it would be nice if protestant church have celibate order to show the world that sex be not the important thing in life to tell the truth gay church remind me a lot of henry the viii start the church of england in order to get a divorce or be this a myth note that i be not deny that gay christian be christian

 note i be break this reply into 2 part due to length i agree that there be no verse that have go unchallenged by gay right activist but if there be zero verse that     clearly address the issue    that mean that there be also no verse that clearly  support  your case be you sure you want to say that there be zero verse that clearly address the issue the story in genesis 19 tell of the citizen of sodom demand an opportunity to    know    the two men who be lot  s guest the fact that the sodomite become angry when lot offer them his daughter could be see a indicate that they be interested only in homosexual intercourse yes what they want be rape homosexual rape and everybody agrees that that be wrong some christian believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire be just a sinful a the rape aspect of their desire the passage do not say what it be that so offend god whether it be the homosexuality or the intend rape or both but i believe that it be only fair to consider all the possible alternative in the light of related scripture i do not believe that those who believe god be offend by both the homosexuality and the rape be try to say that homosexuality be itself a form of rape you seem to take the view that the  only  sin described in gen  19 be in the fact that the sodomite want to commit rape and that it be unfair to    stigmatize    their homosexuality by associate it with the sin of rape i can see how you might reach such a conclusion if you start from the conclusion that there be nothing wrong with homosexuality but then again not suppose to start from our conclusion because circular reason if god be in fact oppose to homosexual intercourse in general then the more probably interpretation be that he be at least a offend by the sodomite blatant homosexuality a he be by their intent to commit rape later on i will document why i believe the old testament portrays god a one who despises  any  homosexual intercourse even if both partner be consent adult the moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regard the church a the proper authority for determine what  kinds  of marriage would be legitimate and thus the church  s refusal to recognize    pervert    marriage be circular reason my question however have nothing to do with the church ordain new kind of marriage and so his argument be something of a straw man in term of my original question the precise definition translation of    porneia    really important unless you be try to argue that the bible really condemn extramarital sex not sure the moderator be try to do that in any case i think both you and the moderator have miss the point here when jesus be ask about divorce he reply    have you not read that he who create them from the begin make them male and female and say  for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh consequently they be no longer two but one flesh what therefore god have join together let no man separate    mt 19 4 6 i read here that the sexual union of a man male and his wife female be a divinely ordained union in other word the institution of heterosexual marriage be something ordain and establish by god    not by men and not by the church but by god men be not suppose to dissolve this union in jesus word because it be not something create by men this be not circular reason this be just reading god  s word i read in the bible that god ordain the union of male and female i do not read of any similar divinely ordained union of two male or two female grant there have be uninspired men who have ordain    alternative    union caligula report to have    married    his horse but the only union that jesus refers to a    what god have join together    be the heterosexual union of a man and his wife pardon me for mention caligula i know probably inflammatory and i should save it for the discussion on bestiality in part 2 of this post please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply anyway my original question be not whether we should translate    porneia    in a way that condemns only a select few kind of extramarital sex my question be give that heterosexual marriage be the only union described by the bible a divinely ordained and give a biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage be homosexual intercourse sinful of course i see now that first we need to ask whether the bible really condemns sex outside of marriage you seem to be try to argue that only certain kind of extramarital sex and other sin be really wrong alternatively it may be that the definition of such term a    porneia    and all the rest be in paul  s day what we would call a faq i e the law a the    tutor    appoint by god to lead u to christ have just spent some sixteen century drum into the head of god  s people the idea that thing like homosexual intercourse be abomination that deserve punishment by death perhaps paul go into detail on what    porneia    c be because after 1600 year he consider the question to have be dealt with already perhaps the reason god  s apostle and prophet do not devote a great deal of time define a distinct new testament sexuality be because he do not intend any significant change in the sexuality he have already establish by the law i  ll discus the law and homosexuality in great detail below but i just want to point out that the new testament  s failure to develop a detailed new standard of sexuality be not necessarily evidence that god do not care about sexual conduct    especially after 1600 year of put people to death for practice homosexuality and how do you define an    obsessively driven    mode of sexual behavior how do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drive be the desire to have    sinful    sex an obsessively driven mode of behavior i think you see that this be circular reason why be it define a sinful because it be obsessive what make it obsessive the fact that the person be driven to seek it even though sinful or be it obsessive because it be a desire for that which society condemns once again circular why be it define a obsessive because the person want it even though society condemns it why do society condemn it because it be obsessive you seem to be try to limit the bible  s condemnation of    porneia    to only    pervert    sex act but i think you can really define    pervert    without fall into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of what then be paul condemn when he declares that    fornicator     shall not enter the kindgom of heaven    i think you misunderstood me i be not try to make an argument on some technical definition of    porneia    i be raise the issue of the sinfulness of extramarital sex and the lack of any scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely ordained union of heterosexual couple please remember what you just say here for when we discus bestiality in part 2  i be glad you ask would you agree that if god condemns homosexual intercourse even among those who be not under the law of moses then this would show that god  s condemnation of homosexual act go beyond the ritual law if i can show you from scripture that god punish the homosexual behavior of people who be  not  under the law of moses would you agree that god  s definition of homosexual intercourse a an abomination be not limited to just the ritual law and those who be under the law be have a private email discussion with a 7th day adventist on the subject of the sabbath and my main point against a christian sabbath keeping requirement have be that nowhere in scripture do god command gentile to rest on the sabbath nor do he ever condemn gentile for fail to rest on the sabbath this illustrates the difference between universal requirement such a    thou shalt not kill    and requirement that be merely part of the temporary jews only law of moses such a the sabbath the point you be try to make be that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse a    an abomination    be  just  a part of the temporary jews only law of moses i on the other hand believe that it be label by god a an abomination for gentile a well a jew and that he punish those guilty of this behavior by death or exile here  s why back in genesis 15 god promise to give abraham all the land that be then in the possession of    the amorite       kinda hard on the amorite you think but in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be a unjust a it sound it seem god be go to postpone this takeover for quite a while because    the iniquity of the amorite be not yet complete    remember this be all long before there be a ritual law what then be the iniquity the amorite be commit that when complete would justify his be cast out of his own land and or kill go back and look at lev 18 again verse 1 23 list a variety of sin include child sacrifice incest homosexuality and bestiality begin in verse 24 god start say    do not defile yourselves by any of these thing for _by_all_these_ _things_ the nation which i be cast out before you _have_ _become_defiled_ for the land have become defile therefore i have visit it punishment upon it so the land have spew out it inhabitant     for whoever do any of these abomination those person who do so shall be cut off from among their people    notice that god say the gentile nation who be  not  under the ritual law of moses be about to be punish because they have    defile    themselves and their land by commit    abomination    that include incest bestiality and homosexuality flip ahead two chapter to lev 20 and you will find these same    abomination    list and this time god decree the death penalty on anyone involve in any of these thing include specifically a man    lie with another man a one lie with a woman    lv 20 13 their    bloodguiltiness    be upon them meaning that in god  s eye they deserve to die for have do such thing accord to lev 18 26 29 even    the alien non jew who sojourn among you    be to refrain from these practice on penalty of be    cut off by god from among their people    under the circumstance i believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the old testament god object only to the intend rape and not the homosexuality in sodom since god take the trouble to specifically list sex between two consent men a one of the reason for wipe out the canaanite nation not homosexual rape mind you but plain voluntary gay sex say god be not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior even by those who have nothing to do with the mosaic covenant accord to ii tim 3 16 all scripture be inspire by god and be profitable for teach reproof correction and training in righteousness thus i believe that even though we gentile christian be not under the law we can learn from study it if a certain action be define a a sin because it be a violation of the law then it be a sin only for those who be under the law for example in the case of sabbath keeping where god reveals that certain action be abomination even for those who be not under the law then i conclude that god  s objection to the practice be not base on whether or not a person be under the law but on the sinfulness of the act itself in the case of homosexuality homosexual intercourse be define by god a a defile abomination for gentile a well a jew i e for those who be not under the law a well a for those who be thus i be not at all try to say that gentile christian have any obligation to keep any part of the law i be simply say that god refer to homosexuality a a sin even for those who be not obligate to keep the law if this be so then i do not think we can appeal to our exemption from the law a valid ground for legitimize a practice god have declare a bloodguilty abomination that defile both jew and gentile continued in part 2
 i can see that some of the above verse do not clearly address the issue however a couple of them seem a though they do not require    incredibly perverse interpretation    in order to be see a condemn homosexuality        do not be deceive neither fornicator nor idolators nor adulterer nor effeminate nor homosexual nor thief nor the covetous nor drunkard nor revilers nor swindler shall inherit the kingdom of god and such be some of you        i cor 6 9 11  would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seem to say fornicator will not inherit the kingdom of god how do this apply to homosexual i understand    fornication    to be sex outside of marriage be this an accurate definition be there any such thing a same sex marriage in the bible my understand have always be that the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife i be however willing to listen to scriptural evidence to the contrary    you shall not lie with a male a one lie with a female it be an abomination also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defile with it nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it it be a perversion    lev 18 22 23  i notice that the verse forbid bestiality immediately follow the verse prohibit what appear to be homosexual intercourse i know of no new testament passage that clearly condemn or even mention intercourse with animal do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the bible condemns bestiality a a perversion and if so why that be what verse would you cite to prove that bestiality be pervert and sinful could the verse you cite be refute by interpret them differently can one be a christian zoophile by the way i myself be subject to sexual desire that i do not choose to have and that many people would regard a pervert and sinful so please understand that i be not ask these question out of an antipathy towards my fellow    people of alternative orientation    i do believe however that one should read the bible with an attitude of    what be the bible try to say    and not    what do i want the bible to say    i choose not to give in to my    pervert    sexual desire because i believe the bible try to tell me whether i like it or not that such thing be sin it be frustrate at time and i have have day where it really get me down but i blame god for this i blame the sin itself mark there  s some ambiguity about the meaning of the word in the passage you quote both liberal and conservative source seem to agree that    homosexual    be not the general term for homosexual but be likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute that meant that i think all the biblical evidence vanishes but the nature of the evidence be such that you just quote one verse and solve thing i think your argument from fornication be circular why be homosexuality wrong because fornication why be it fornication because not married why they married because the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony why do the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony because homosexuality be wrong in order to break the circle there  s get to be some other reason to think homosexuality be wrong
 comment                                                                        there be a big difference between the status of what you refer to a alexandrian actually this include all oriental orthodox church and not only copt and that of nestorian the oriental orthodox church never even    shelter    eutyches the advocator of monophysitism but on the contrary it condemn and still do condemn him and his heresy that be why the eastren chalcedonian orthodox church held talk with the oriental non chalcedonian that start 30 year ago and still continue till today but they have converge on many issue the most imporatant of which be christology i have more detail of the inter orthodox dialogue in case anyone be interested so i do not see how the    alexandrian    and the nestorian be in a similar position peace

 ouch this be a good question to me not exist be bad than exist no matter what so i will modify this question to be would i be a christian if it make no eternal difference in my reward or punishment i hope this be in the same spirit you want i personally be very goal orient it be hard for me to do thing that do not achieve some goal however to relate this to sport only after i learn to not care about the score do i become a good basketball player i have to learn to go all out no matter the situation perhaps this lesson be relevent after all only if i can give up my life can i keep it only if i be humble can i achieve glory only if i concentrate on living my life now the best i can will i be afford life eternal i think you have illuminate the true meaning of    save by faith    but what be my answer right now i would remain a christian however be that always my answer the problem heaven and hell be good motivator at certain stage of maturity and i admit there be certain time when perhaps i bite my tongue and put up with something in the hope of a well day i e i mentally trade present happiness for future happiness i hope the cynic and skeptic do not read more into that than appropriate but i be try to be honest i think these kind of question be extremely fruitful i guess it depends on how one view knowledge and learn by strip idea to simple straightforward oppose concept we can determine level of importance by analyze the theoretically absurd we can gain a well understand of the actually absurd

 but that go for any sin my father told me when he be grow up catholic be not allow to associate with anyone who be divorce there be a few verse prohibitting divorce somehow divorce become acceptable even in catholicism anullments certainly it be no longer a sin to associate with a divorce person the point be that each person have their own temptation to deal with paul repeatedly talk about the    thorn    in his side some think it refers to lust others pride but who know whatever the thorn be apparently it be not    compatible    with christianity yet do that make his epistle any less the bible warns u against judging greed anxiety impure thought bearing grudge etc  etc i suppose we should seek out all the so called christian who have entertain impure thought and oust them all those who have give in to greed get  em outta here jesus point out that he be the physician for the sinner any attempt to make homosexual feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality be incompatible with christianity be our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to jesus we need to keep them away do jesus need u to screen out those guilty of a particular sin do we really mistrust jesus when he say he can forgive any sin think about it among the people jesus encounter be sinner and the pharisee the sinner he embrace and forgave the pharisee hypocritcal unmerciful self righteous point out others sin and do not seek and thus do not gain forgiveness of their own sin what i take from this and other verse be that if we do not admit our sin those sin will not be forgiven and since those guilty of even one sin be guilty of the whole law those not repent the judging of others be guilty a guilty a if they commit the same sin they judged others of the poor in spirit meek humble merciful pure of heart peacemaker those who thirst for justice those who suffer for his sake be bless
 peter white writes miss on very important passage 2 thess 1 6 10 for after all it be only just for god to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to you who be afflict and to u a well when the lord jesus shall be reveal from heaven with his mighty angel in flame fire deal out retribution to those who do not know god and to those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus and these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he come to be glorify in his saint on that day and to be marvel at among all who have believe    for our testimony to you be believe thing to note from this passage unbeliever be both those who openly reject the gospel and those who do not know god the eternal destruction be the same a the eternal hope in 2 16  this distructions primarily emphasize that it be separation from the presence of god the context be speak of the 2nd advent while 2 1 be speak of the rapture confuse the two yet we have a far great discription of hell that we do heaven for instance if this be like earthly fire that require a gas produce substance to ignite however there seem to be a different type of fire a express in the burning bush that be not consume also the daniel acct show that the law of nature can be interupted even with earthly fire maybe you understand there will be those who be alive at the end of the millenium who will walk straight into the gwtj even those who have die in their sin will be resurrect i e reunite with their physical body to receive condemnation this be contrary to the teach of scripture this be conjecture at best if you be use it to support the    no physical body    thesis the true awlfulness of hell be that it be eternal separation from god after have see the glory of his presence at the gwtj but whether it be open rebellion against the reveal gospel of christ or if it be not have know god not saught him a he be then a paul say they be without excuss and that every mouth will be stop there will be no defense at the judgment seat of god therefore we understand    it be appoint unto man once to die and then come judgment    literally just because it be horrific make it less of a reality it should compel those of u who have the rich of christ to share it with others
