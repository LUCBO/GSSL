try position give try thanks eric att com danny db martin es start server joe english joe art com start lot client xsession whatever sleep second two launch one change script log actually take time heavily load system core sound crazy confirm work com provide good explanation work summarize start server take huge amount time start accept connection lot initialization server start process touch large number page process run same time fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance sort client start similarly lot initialization whenever client program start toolkits register widget resource fetch program initialize state database forth activity typically memory intensive once initialization process reach steady state memory usage typically settle use page use
