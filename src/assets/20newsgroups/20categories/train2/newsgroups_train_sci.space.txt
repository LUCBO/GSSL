actually originally intend go lunar orbit indeed fuel hand lunar orbit mission tiny lunar flyby transmitter failure proper insertion lunar orbit positively confirm note technique disadvantage take long time end relatively lunar orbit want useful like low circular polar orbit plan certain amount fuel reduce need brute force approach
comment office exploration office space science griffin chief engineer position just meaningless administrative ill opinion seem like bad thing least surface griffin seem actually interested thing willing look innovative approach thing faster well cheaper unclear whether able new position anyone know new duty _______________________________________________________________________________
