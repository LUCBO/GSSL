b"what be your proof that they `` do the best they could '' unless they have strong evidence that the child be in immediate danger then `` the best they could '' have do be to show restraint some of u do predict this outcome or at least suggest a strong possibility of it i for one say that in the event of an assault against the building the child be the one in danger either from the assault itself or from a `` jonestown '' my phrase a week after the seige start style suicide and a i point out then and repeatedly over the objection of people on the net who disagreed with me an adult may freely choose suicide but they have no right to impose this choice on their child now while i expect the fbi to pay any attention to what i have to say on this i *do* expect them to figure it out on their own or to take the advice of expert the cult specialist inter- view in yesterday 's boston globe say he be repeatedly `` stonewall '' by the fbi when he point out to them that their confrontational tactic played perfectly into koresh 's mad view of the world and so increase the chance of a tragic outcome give *us* a break pump teargas for 45 minute into a compound fill with child this seem to show much regard for their life or safety `` nontoxic teargas '' be an oxymoron child have tiny respiratory passage which be easily block by the secretion induced by teargas moreover teargas can easily cause fatality in anyone subject to laryngospasm asthma or heart disease if a madman be hold a gun to a hostage someone who provokes the madman by attack him bear nearly a much repsonsibility for the death of the hostage a the madman himself these kind of situation have to be handle *delicately* not by surround a place with tank and heavily arm personnel and blaring rock music from loud- speaker at all hour that approach be idiotic the solution be to greatly reduce the authority of the `` the authority '' the fed show themselves here a they have so many time in the past to be a gang of trigger-happy impulsive yahoo who cause more trouble than they prevent their confrontational approach reinforce every single message koresh be give his follower virtually guarantee- ing that whatever crazy solution koresh propose would be follow willingly this be point out here on compuserve in the press just about every place except in the justice department where it seem a n.i.h philosophy prevails"
b"the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 20 1993 remark by the president in question and answer session with the press the rise garden 1:36 p.m. edt the president on february the 28th four federal agent be kill in the line of duty try to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which have illegally stockpile weaponry and ammunition and place innocent child at risk because the batf operation have fail to meet it objective a 51-day standoff ensue the federal bureau of investigation then make every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and far loss of life the bureau 's effort be ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they be deal david koresh be dangerous irrational and probably insane he engage in numerous activity which violate both federal law and common standard of decency he be moreover responsible for the death and injury which occur during the action against the compound in february give his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostage no provocative action be take for more than seven week by federal agent against the compound this weekend i be briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi design to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan include a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it be hop force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i be inform of the plan to end the siege i discuss it with attorney general reno i ask the question i thought it be appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought be right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday 's action end in a horrible human tragedy mr. koresh 's response to the demand for his surrender by federal agent be to destroy himself and murder the child who be his captive a well a all the other people who be there who do not survive he kill those he control and he bear ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensue now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have direct the united state department of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happen and why and whether anything could have be do differently i have told the department to involve independent professional law enforcement official in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answer in whatever time be require to complete the review finally i have direct the department to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiry so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agent on the front line who do the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstance again i want to say a i do yesterday i be very sorry for the loss of life which occur at the begin and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempt to join cult and to become involve with people like david koresh will be deter by the horrible scene they have see over the last seven week and i hope very much that the difficult situation which federal agent confront there and which they will be doubtless require to confront in other context in the future will be somewhat well handle and well understood because of what have be learn now q mr. president can you first of all tell u why after 51 day you decide -- q mr. president can you describe for u what it be that janet reno outline to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- the president i hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno -- q mr. president -- the president i 'll answer both your question but i do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i be told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time have come to take another step in try to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be -- that they want to go in and use tear gas which have be test not to cause permanent damage to adult or to child but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it be hop that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i be far told that under no circumstance would our people fire any shot at them even if fire upon they be go to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicle which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact a you know an awful lot of shot be fire by the cult member at the federal official there be no shot come back from the government side i ask a number of question the first question i ask be why now we have wait seven week why now the reason i be give be the follow number one that there be a limit to how long the federal authority could maintain with their limited resource the quality and intensity of coverage by expert there they might be need in other part of the country number two that the people who have review this have never see a case quite like this one before and they be convince that no progress have be make recently and no progress be go to be make through the normal mean of get koresh and the other cult member to come out number three that the danger of their do something to themselves or to others be likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they have reason to believe that the child who be still inside the compound be be abuse significantly a well a be force to live in unsanitary and unsafe condition so for those reason they want to move at that time the second question i ask the attorney general be whether they have give consideration to all of the thing that could go wrong and evaluate them against what might happen that be good she say that the fbi personnel on the scene and those work with them be convince that the chance of bad thing happen would only increase with the passage of time the third question i ask be have the military be consult a soon a the initial tragedy come to light in waco the first thing i ask to be do because it be obvious that this be not a typical law enforcement situation military people be then brought in help to analyze the situation and some of the problem that be present by it and so i ask if the military have be consult the attorney general say that they have and that they be in basic agreement that there be only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military -- something that both side thought be not of overwhelm significance have ask those question and gotten those answer i say that if she thought it be the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr. president -- the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception -- report widely television radio and newspaper -- that you be try somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no bewilder by it the only reason i make no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason i make no public statement yesterday be that i have nothing to add to what be be say and i literally do not know until rather late in the day whether anybody be still alive other than those who have be actually see and take to the hospital or take into custody it be purely and simply a question of wait for event to unfold there be -- i have -- i account for why people speculate one way or the other but i talk to the attorney general on the day before the action take place i talk to her yesterday i call her again late last night after she appear on the larry king show and i talk to her again this morning a president -- it be not possible for a president to distance himself from thing that happen when the federal government be in control i will say this however i be frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatic murder themselves applause i regret what happen but it be not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people kill four federal official in the line of duty they be heavily arm they fire on federal official yesterday repeatedly and they be never fire back on we do everything we could to avoid the loss of life they make the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the child but in the end the last comment i have from janet reno be when -- and i talk to her on sunday -- i say now i want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she say because of the child they have evidence that those child be still be abuse and that in increasingly unsafe condition and that they think it will get any easy with time -- with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that be where i think thing stand q can we assume then that you think this be mishandle in view of the outcome that you run out of patience and if you have it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no -- well i think what you can assume be just exactly what i announce today this be a -- the fbi have do a lot of thing right for this country over a long period of time this be the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety-split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the step along the way be there something else we should have know be there some other question they should have ask be there some other question i should have ask can i say for sure that no one -- that we could have do nothing else to make the outcome come different i know that why i want the inquiry and why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non-political outside expert who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there be unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there be anything we can do particularly when there be child involve but i do think it be important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case be the people who kill others and then kill themselves q mr. president be there any other option present to you for resolve this situation at any point from february 28th until yesterday the president well yes i get regular report all along the way there be lot of other option pursue if you go back -- you all cover it very well the fbi -- you do a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authority there pursue any number of other option all along the way and a lot of them early on seem to be work some of the child get out some of the other people left there be a -- at one point there seem to be some line of communication opening up between koresh and the authority and then he would say thing and not do them and thing just begin to spin downward whether there be other -- in term of what happen yesterday the conversation i have with the attorney general do not involve other option except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we be pursue -- because they say they want to do this because they thought this be the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves what they thought q do the government know that the child do not have gas mask q congressional hearing once the situation -- be you in agreement with that the president up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think very important that the treasury and justice department launch this investigation and bring in some outside expert and a i say in my statement if any congressional committee want to look into it we will fully cooperate there be nothing to hide here this be probably the most well-covered operation of it kind in the history of the country go ahead sarah q there be two question i want to ask you the first be i think that they knew very well that the child do not have gas mask while the adult do so the child have no chance because this gas be very -- she say it be not lethal but it be very dangerous to the child and they could not have survive without gas mask and on february 28th -- let 's go back -- those people have a right to practice their religion the president they be not just practice their religion they be -- the treasury department believe that they have violate federal law any number of them q what federal law -- the president let me go back and answer -- i answer the question about the gas mask except to tell you that the whole purpose of use the tear gas be that it have be test they be convince that it kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathe it to run outside and one of the thing that heard -- i want to get into the detail of this because i know -- but one of the thing that they be speculate about today be that the wind be blowing so fast that the window might have be open and some of the gas might have escape and that may be why it have the desire effect they also knew sarah that there be an underground compound -- a bus bury underground where the child could be sent and they be -- i think they be hop very much that if the child be not release immediately outside that the humane thing would be do and that the child would be sent someplace where they could be protect in term of the gas mask themselves i learn yesterday -- i do not ask this fact question before -- that the gas be suppose to stay active in the compound longer than the gas mask themselves be to work so that it be thought that even if they all have gas mask that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance ms. myers last question q mr. president why be you still say that -- q could you tell u whether or not you ever ask janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide and when you learn about the actual fire and explosion what go through your mind during those horrendous moment the president what i ask janet reno be if they have consider all the bad thing that could happen and she say -- and of course the whole issue of suicide have be raise in the public -- he have -- that have be debate anyway and she say that the people who be most knowledgeable about these kind of issue conclude that there be no great risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future that be the judgment they make whether they be right or wrong of course we will never know what happen when i saw the fire when i saw the building burning i be sick i felt terrible and my immediate concern be whether the child have gotten out and whether they be escape or whether they be inside try to burn themselves up the first thing i want to know thank you q mr. president why be you still say it be a janet reno decision it in the end your decision the president well what say be that i have a four- or five-hour detailed briefing from the fbi i go over every strategic part of it it be a decision for which i take responsibility the president of the united state and i sign off on the general decision and give her the authority to make the last call when i talk to her on sunday some time have elapse she might have make a decision to change her mind i say if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow i will support you and i do support her she be not ultimately responsible to the american people i be but i think she have conduct her duty in an appropriate fashion and she have dealt with this situation i think a well a she could have thank you applause"

b"recent study have show that the number of men who have engage in homosexual activity in the last decade be 2.3 and the number of men who be exclusively homosexual be 1.1 these figure be much less than those that come from earlier study that show that homosexuality among men be a lot high so what can we deduce from these figure be there a lot less male homosexual than there use to be or be men perhaps woman too not a honest a they use to be about there sexuality presumably the people that be poll in you mean in the 1940s men and woman be much more open about their homosexuality than today want to try that one again this survey be assure of their anonymnity so they should have answer the question honestly i suppose however it could be that gay feel so repress and denigrate by society that they feel that they could be forthcoming about there sexuality in something like a survey if this true then be it possible that there be a lot more gay out there than we be lead to believe perhaps if american be more open about there sexuality -- -i think most american -- -then we might discover that there be really quite a few more people out there who be orientate toward the same sex -- -men and woman include venture a guess that there be a lot of people out there who have consider have a relationship with someone of the same sex at some point in there life maybe they take their longing seriously but this make these longing any less valid therefore if american so repress about their sexuality in general -- -as i believe they may be -- -then see a lot more people `` come out of the closet '' you mean ignore study after study so that we can continue to accept a study kinsey 's that be obviously wrong a for myself a heterosexual and never consider have sex with another man just the way i be ... i could have just a easily of be gay i suppose one of the big debate about homosexuality be whether or not a type of behavior that be learn or if one be just born that way imho the more likely explanation be that some combination of the two base on what besides your own warm fuzzy feeling here 's something to ponder upon have any of you gay-bashers out there ever consider that homosexual probably deem their sexual orientation a be a state of affair that be just a much an intrinsic and `` natural '' part of their life a heterosexual do about their own sexuality in other word someone who be *truly* alcoholic share that feel until they hit bottom gay may not be able to live any other way even if they date someone of the opposite sex or get married in their *heart* they be still a homosexual likewise if someone who be *truly* heterosexual form a relationship with someone of the same sex then they be *still* a heterosexual even though outward appearance may suggest otherwise scott kennedy brewer and patriot unless of course the problem be that homosexuality be a form of mental disorder cause by childhood sexual abuse a a number of recent work suggest if homosexual would stop use the government to impose their morality on others antidiscrimination law and leave our child alone i care in the least what they do in private but until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of government be to tell peaceful people how to live i have no choice but to continue to point out that homosexuality be not an `` alternative lifestyle '' but a sickness before `` david koresh be a cheap thug who interprets the bible through the barrel of a gun ...

b"note this be a repost of my earlier response to mr. starr which be not properly format apology to those who've see the follow before to explain my position on the `` war on drug '' i offer this drug and crime a new approach by ken barnes give that 1. the trade in illegal drug be responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation 2. people who want drug particularly people who be predispose to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they be legally available 3. despite current law enforcement effort drug be readily available to those who want them 4. addiction to drug both legal and illegal be responsible for a significant drain on the productive resource of our country and this occurs in a variety of way from the cocaine-addicted baby who be unable to learn to the spread of disease among addict to the tragic consequence of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking 5. a general economic principle of government be that whatever be subsidize you get more of and whatever be taxed you get less of to be most effective in confront the nation 's drug problem some way must be found to utilize these additional power of government to make drug deal and drug use less attractive while this country 's current effort to combat legal drug have succeed in some respect there be a great awareness of the health consequence of smoking and designated-driver program have help reduce drunk drive for example the same can not be say for the `` war '' on illegal drug there remains a core group of illegal drug user which support international network of smuggler pusher grower processor kingpin and gangster these network and their `` marketing activity '' which include drive- by shooting corrupt law enforcement authority and smuggle weapon be directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crime commit in our country every day clearly illegal drug and rise crime be link it take only a moment 's reflection to recognize how they be link the link be money a with this country 's fail effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market have be create in which greedy local monopoly like the gangster of a bygone era have profit enormously from their illegal trade the victim of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire but i would argue the drug user themselves be it not for the black market and the violent monopoly of the drug lord drug user might not be the thief robber prostitute and murderer they have become in order to pay the high price the drug lord demand in the absence of the drug lord most would be i believe simply people with a problem either a moral problem_or_a medical problem but_not_a criminal problem let me be clear however i am_not_advocating that we let the criminal who have be prey on our society for these many year of prohibition off the hook on the contrary the new approach i advocate be one which would not result in either the government or private industry get into the business of promote crack cocaine or any other presently illegal drug for that matter neither be it an approach which see law abide citizen hand over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug user until `` the land of the free and the home of the brave '' look like a police state here then be my proposal 1. possession and use of all presently illegal drug be decriminalize but buying and sell them remains illegal 'potheads can grow their own marijuana a many already do today other drug user can legally import their poison of choice a long a they pay the tariff and a barter economy of drug experimenter develops 2. because of the barter economy which supply the drug user the black market profit that have so enrich the drug lord dwindle if these drug can be obtain for 'free or next to nothing why buy them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these `` noncommercial '' drug even at relatively low price therefore 3. law enforcement activity be concentrate on those individual who continue to buy and sell and also on the crime commit by drug user too poor to afford even low price but here be where the strategy begin to differentiate between the drug dealer the victimizer and the drug user their victim 4. upon arrest for_any_crime _suspects be permit to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate be inform that upon conviction for the crime they be accuse of if they be found to be a drug user they will be institutionalize until they be clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and be already drug-free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and be convict face stiffer fine and serve longer sentence 5. institutionalization of drug use criminal serf several purpose drug use criminal and this include drunk and/or 'stoned driver be separate from their source of supply thus reduce the total number of drug user in society at large and consequently decrease the demand for drug on the street put more of the remain drug dealer out of business institutionalization provide an incentive for drug use criminal to straighten themselves out before become part of the general prison population while help protect society from crime institutionalization could also serve to deter drug user from become criminal since drug use criminal unlike other criminal would be delayed prior to serve their sentence by the additional time it take for them to sober up institutionalization of drug use criminal separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitor pool of addict who could volunteer for research study of new technique and treatment for addictive disease with the potential to benefit both themselves and others 6. dealer in illegal drug be generally not drug user themselves and this be particularly true of the drug boss or kingpin run large illicit organization under this proposal dealer would be more readily identifiable since upon arrest they would presumably pas the drug test or else decline to take it in order to avoid have to explain why they be in possession of drug when it be apparent they do not use them decline to take the test they would of course face stiffer penalty while each case of attempt sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own it merit the outcome of a suspect 's drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution 7. just a cigarette tax have contribute to the decline of smoking in our country by make cigarette more costly while at the same time provide revenue for anti-smoking campaign noncommercial drug should be taxed and the money generate should be use to combat their use enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however and should not be use a an excuse to infringe on the right and privacy of noncommercial drug user since to do so would have the effect of reintroduce prohibition instead drug user will be encourage to pay the tax by remind them that if untaxed drug be ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operation they will be require to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drug to be destroyed if drug dealer be found to be sell noncommercial drug on which tax have not be paid they will face additional prosecution for evade the tax the strategy of add tax evasion to drug deal charge be already in use in some jurisdiction but it effectiveness be currently limited by the illegality of drug possession revenue from drug possession tax and import tariff would be use to fund anti-drug advertising campaign and provide support to private sector drug treatment program for those unable to afford treatment 8. taxpayer subsidy to all drug producer must be end federal support of tobacco farm be both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budget and the marijuana crop grown illicitly on federal land in many state must likewise be eliminate while my proposal would have the effect of permit the use of what be now illegal drug it would hold the user of all drug responsible for their action and i believe would reduce the harm drug have on our society particularly the crime cause by the illegal drug trade so long a we remain a free nation with relatively porous border and freedom for our citizen to travel we will always have a drug problem whether it take the form of heroin addict die in abandon building drunk driver kill and maim others on our street or emphysema patient struggle for breath after a lifetime of smoking the result be the same needle suffer and death a a society we must recognize that while our society permit u to harm ourselves with drug a we be already do regardless of the drug law we must take a stand against the harm that drug and drug user cause to others we must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartel which prey on the weakness of drug user by take the profit out of their deadly trade my proposal go a long way towards shut down these powerful criminal organization the question of whether drug use be a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug user talk about different drug have different effect and some be more addictive than others the addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individual and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation while others find they can not resist the bottle nicotine which former surgeon general c. everett koop declare to be a addict a heroin be a legal drug with know harmful effect and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer for those individual who can stop take drug on their own we may argue that because they have chosen to use them this represent a moral failure on their part or an unwillingness to face the difficulty of life but for the addict while they may have chosen to use drug the first time by the time they discover their addiction it be too late we can not hold them responsible for their disease any more than we would blame someone who be drown for an inability to swim perhaps they should have know not to go near the water or perhaps someone should have warn them of the danger but in their present circumstance warning will not help neither do it help for the drug dealer on the shore to be toss them weight"

briefing room 12:36 p.m. edt mr. stephanopoulos a you know the president be go to come out at 1:15 p.m. with your indulgence i think what like to do be have the president award the national teacher 's award first and then have the teacher leave or whatever and then make a statement on waco and take a couple question so if we can just hold off go live and all that until do it probably will work out a lot well q if give u the time the problem q get a two-minute warn problem mr. stephanopoulos yes it be a problem about 1:15 p.m. q the teacher would walk off and then -- mr. stephanopoulos i think -- just try to work this out here i think the best way to handle it q can i ask you a series of question about the way the president handle the notification yesterday mr. stephanopoulos sure q do you for instance talk to the justice department about who would come out and discus what have happen in waco and whether it should be the attorney general or the president mr. stephanopoulos why we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of event on the contact between the justice department and the white house a you know and a say the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday sunday afternoon they have a good discussion about 15 minute the attorney general inform the president of what she want to do he raise no objection obviously she have the implicit authority from the president to go forward he raise no objection she go forward they have a discussion of a general nature about the incident again yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m. the president spoke with the attorney general again they have a brief discussion over what be happen in waco a you know this be before the fire broke out at the compound and i think that be why there be some -- just some confusion i think that she be confuse in her mind before and after the fire not the actual day when they spoke then there be a number of contact at a number of different level in the white house yesterday afternoon between the justice department and the white house they be inform u of their decision what they would like to do there be an fbi briefing in waco the attorney general have her press conference the president then issue a statement after that frankly yesterday afternoon you know there be a fair amount of confusion over exactly what be happen on the ground in waco and i think that we want to be very careful not to have the president say anything until we have a much well sense of what be actually happen on the ground once we be fairly clear on what be happen on the ground in waco the president issue a statement he spoke with the attorney general again yesterday even q at what hour be that mr. stephanopoulos it be quite late i believe it be after he return from the holocaust museum he take a tour of the holocaust museum last night q and he go out to dinner mr. stephanopoulos i believe briefly yes he go to dinner and then he spoke with the attorney general last night i know the exact time i think it be relatively late and he just say i think a dee dee have report that he just want to tell her that he thought she handle a difficult situation very well that she do a good job in a tough situation and that she should try and get some sleep he then again spoke with her this morning about the follow-up in waco and about what go to do this afternoon a you know the president will have an announcement to make at 1:15. q do he ever talk with webb hubbell yesterday last night or this morning mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge no q be webb hubbell the point man for the white house mr. stephanopoulos webb hubbell be the general white house liaison and several people talk to webb the attorney general be run the operation q do he tell her that she should sleep well that she have do a good job or he just tell her that she should get some sleep mr. stephanopoulos i think sleep well -- do a good job -- i know the exact word i think that sound right q i mean sleep well have implication a to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not mr. stephanopoulos well i mean i think everybody feel badly when you have a situation when -- q i understand that but whether the issue of blame be brought up in that phraseology mr. stephanopoulos i think the spirit -- no it have nothing to do with that the spirit with which it be offer be that the entire administration and certainly the attorney general have to face a very difficult decision a very difficult situation yesterday and that he thought that she have handle it well a best a she could and -- q well do he think it be mishandle mr. stephanopoulos -- it be just speak of warm word to a friend q do he think the situation be mishandle mr. stephanopoulos the president -- q in retrospect mr. stephanopoulos the president stand by the decision of the law enforcement agency the decision of the attorney general he accepts full responsibility at the same time i think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happen do a full review and make sure we do what we can to make sure this happen -- this kind of thing happen again or at least we know how to handle it q how much do he know about what she be go to go ahead with i know that she make the case to him -- explain -- outline the case for action do she say to him on sunday precisely what action mr. stephanopoulos i think it be specific operational detail a to what be go to happen i think that they have a general discussion about the action about the advisability of action i think a she note he ask a few general question just try to get a sense of how thing be consider but it minute-by-minute detail of how the operation -- q well be it `` we be go in '' be it `` go to use tear gas '' i mean what mr. stephanopoulos i believe it be that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out q george be there ever a conscious political decision make or even a discussion about distance the president from -- mr. stephanopoulos not at all i mean we be in close contact with the justice department the president accepts responsibility for this at the same time -- i mean we just want to be very very clear about how this happen and be a factual a we could be on how the decision be make it be the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendation the attorney general have operational control over this the president obviously accepts responsibility for all of this and he stand by the attorney general q george there be a report on the television today -- and i know more than that -- one of the member of the cult have say go into a courthouse that the fbi have start the fire and not themselves there be also a picture yesterday on the tv of a smash into the building where the fire broke out and my question be be the white house absolutely certain that this fire be -- mr. stephanopoulos all the evidence we have be that this fire be start by david koresh and those inside the compound -- every bit of evidence we have q do the president ask the attorney general why do this now why this particular date and do he ask about possible consequence of either death or injury mr. stephanopoulos i know the specific question he have general question about how the decision be go about be make q those be general question and do he ask generally why now mr. stephanopoulos i think he ask have you consider all of the consequence have you consider the recommendation i know if he ask the question `` why now `` i know if he ask that specific question q do she tell him why now in term of the stuff come out since then about the information provide by the listen device about koresh get increasingly more violent mr. stephanopoulos again not certain how much specific detail they get into i know that she generally say that this be the recommendation s prepared to make i mean the decision s prepared to make base on the recommendation she be receive from the field and after intensive question of those involve again i do not know how precisely detailed it be beyond that q what be the president 's understand why yesterday one of the people who go into the compound a couple week ago come out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitate this action why yesterday mr. stephanopoulos this be the first heard i think what we can go to be what the fbi and the attorney general have say there be indication that those inside the compound be at some danger it be clear that the negotiation have broken down and it be the judgment of the expert involve in the negotiation that the situation be not go to get any well at all there be also some concern over the vulnerability of the agent themselves who have be work long beyond the time that these team normally have to work and a the attorney general have say there be some concern over the fact that they do not have replacement in place who could stand in for them and there be a concern over the safety all of these factor come into play they also consider the advice of a number of psychologist and other expert on david koresh and those in the compound i would just go back to what the attorney general have say you have to make the best judgment you can give the information you have at the time they do obviously we all regret the loss of life a terribly unfortunate situation we all wish it could have turn out differently but that take away from the judgment that be make at the time q george when do the president know that they be go to use tear gas be it before the assault on the compound mr. stephanopoulos i just know i believe he be give a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go i just know q along that point george can you say whether the plan be present to the president by the attorney general a a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday mr. stephanopoulos i think it be present a a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and we all hop a a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it present a tomorrow be d-day this be it q be the president satisfied that a he have all this relevant information necessary to make a decision and b that janet reno have all the relevant information necessary to make a decision mr. stephanopoulos oh i think satisfied that they be act on the best advice and the best information they have and not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever q george be there a 12-hour gap between conversation between the president and the attorney general in other word they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they speak again until clinton get back from dinner at -- mr. stephanopoulos i think likely yes q do he call her what time do she call be there a gap between when she call him i mean be he at dinner when she call and -- mr. stephanopoulos no no no i think he call her last night i swear to it but i believe he call her last night he just want to talk to her q what be go on mr. stephanopoulos not that i know of no q what do you know about the situation now everyone have perish who -- except eight or nine and do you know any of the other detail mr. stephanopoulos i know any more detail than the fbi report in waco q watch cnn or how be he keep track of what be go on if he talk to his attorney general how be he keep track of what be go on here i mean with all due respect to cnn be that how he be do it mr. stephanopoulos no there be also -- a i say several people in the white house be in constant contact with their counterpart at justice to have the full and complete information q who be those contact i mean be it mack mclarty webb hubbell how be the president be kept inform not a -- mr. stephanopoulos i believe mack be in contact with webb i spoke with several people at the justice department i believe bruce lindsey spoke with people at the justice department either bernie or vince be also in contact at different time during the day with people at the justice department we be fully briefed and fully inform q we be told this morning that the president may have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with webb do you know if true or not mr. stephanopoulos i think there 's a chance he may have i believe he do but i think there 's certainly a chance that he may have at some point i believe he do i think that the last contact he have during the day yesterday directly with the justice department be the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the attorney general but the white house be fully inform on a minute-to-minute basis of what be happen in waco and what be happen at the justice department q george who decide that the briefing would be do by the attorney general mr. stephanopoulos the attorney general q do you or do the white house communication staff -- be you ever involve with that decision mr. stephanopoulos no we be told about it q do you ask her to go on nightline and macneil- lehrer and all that stuff be that part of -- mr. stephanopoulos no q there be no advice from the white house at all about her -- she be on all night all day laughter mr. stephanopoulos yes and she do a very good job q why do you decide to have the president 's reaction to the situation be only a write statement which be traditionally the white house 's way of distance the president from the issue not have him appear a personally say anything mr. stephanopoulos well that the intent at all a i say we have to -- we want to wait until we have all of the information at hand the president be also make a statement today the president make a statement yesterday morning the president have be fully involve -- q after this turn into less than a successful operation the only statement from the president be what be on paper after the attorney general have already give what amount to the major fact in this mr. stephanopoulos well it be the first statement from the president not the only statement from the president number one q after the -- mr. stephanopoulos number two -- well the first number two the attorney general -- q he give a statement early in the morning when the thing be start to move -- mr. stephanopoulos right and he give one yesterday and give one today now the second point -- q it just happens this be a write statement with no sort of communication policy or thought process involve it be the president want to put out a write statement mr. stephanopoulos know what we knew at the time we thought it be appropriate for the president and he thought it be appropriate to put out a write statement express his regret and express his support for the attorney general 's -- q why be it not appropriate for him to personally do something mr. stephanopoulos well he do personally do so that be his statement a statement under his name q george yesterday during the briefing you say the president take full responsibility for what happen -- mr. stephanopoulos i certainly do q no what you say be -- mr. stephanopoulos just not right susan q well i think you can go back to the transcript i mean unless i miss something -- mr. stephanopoulos love to q janet reno say that she take full responsibility and you say that she make the decision that the fbi -- mr. stephanopoulos and the president take responsibility absolutely q take responsibility -- all right mr. stephanopoulos check the transcript q consider how little be know about what be go on inside the compound and even now how little be know why be washington call this a mass suicide mr. stephanopoulos well i think that know what we know now and give all of the action of david koresh before and during it be painfully clear that those there be under his control q stretch it a little bit where the kid be concerned though it george mr. stephanopoulos i think that that be an entirely different matter i mean i think that david koresh must bear responsibility for the death of those child absolutely but he clearly be intent on create some kind of an apocalyptic incident and what he do q still operating completely on assumption right i mean you have no evidence or you know of no evidence that this be mass suicide mr. stephanopoulos we have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound which lead to the death of those inside q i quite hear it this might be ann 's question i quite hear it but at what time do clinton himself put out a statement on this i know dee dee say some stuff on this at 6:00 p.m. but the president put out -- mr. stephanopoulos at 6:35 p.m. 6:40 p.m. q right after the even news go on the air mr. stephanopoulos no right when we have all the information we be work on it q dee dee confirm this morning that the investigation the president be go to announce be go to be an administration-run investigation why not have someone from the outside to make sure that not color by those who would have a political stake particularly those at the atf whose action have already be -- mr. stephanopoulos i think that clearly the atf and the justice department will bear responsibility for the investigation not to rule out a be often in investigation like this have some sort of independent involvement a well but it will be run by the treasury and justice q be you confident that you will not have any problem get -- mr. stephanopoulos absolutely q george do the president reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with janet reno and who else in the white house sat in on that meeting anyone else from justice mr. stephanopoulos i believe anybody else be there at the time it be a phone call on monday it a meeting q sunday mr. stephanopoulos sunday it be a phone call it a meeting i believe he might have be there with bruce but beyond that i think he just talk to the attorney general q george you say that in that phone call she say that we want to go in and take action a you say that will force him out what do he think she be talk about if he know about tear gas what exactly be his idea of what he be approve mr. stephanopoulos i think he be approve an action to increase the pressure on -- q\x08q it matter how she do that mr. stephanopoulos no no i mean -- q what information do he have in term of how this would proceed presumably he would have want to know not minute- by-minute but in a general sense -- mr. stephanopoulos i think he knew that this be the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agency i just know -- q what be `` this '' -- when you say that `` this '' be the recommendation -- mr. stephanopoulos the action to increase pressure i know exactly what he be told -- whether he be go to be told that the tank be go to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window or whether he be just told generally that they be move forward in a way that would increase the pressure i just know q hard to imagine him not ask though q that janet reno present him with a her best advice about what they should go forward with he would have agree mr. stephanopoulos he be -- he do ask some general question about the advice and recommendation he give at the same time -- and i would repeat -- that this be base on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agency involve q george it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the president be inform about the nature of the operation be go to come up again here and elsewhere can you take that question and -- mr. stephanopoulos absolutely yes q get the answer and come back to u with all of it mr. stephanopoulos yes q can you tell u that there be never a meeting -- a strategy session -- where you and others decide we will put out a write statement from the president and we will have janet reno be on all of these television broadcast mr. stephanopoulos never never q and you never call the justice department and say to anyone or janet reno `` the one who need to be out front explain this '' mr. stephanopoulos not once q it just happen that way that she be the spokesman that no one ever saw bill session until -- mr. stephanopoulos she make a decision a attorney general that it be important for her a the operational officer in charge a the person who make the decision to go out and take the question on this tragic incident q she have no guidance from the white house at all mr. stephanopoulos we certainly object q but do you -- laughter -- no sure you object but do you suggest it be this a plan -- mr. stephanopoulos no absolutely not q a strategy mr. stephanopoulos no q do she clear it mr. stephanopoulos no q do she notify you mr. stephanopoulos we certainly knew about it q what happen to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talk to every public information officer and every -- under every rock and every place in government that something a major a this could have occur without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the justice department mr. stephanopoulos the attorney general make the decision and the attorney general want to go forward it seem like a good decision it be a good decision she do a good job q let me ask it this way george if in hindsight how you would handle it mr. stephanopoulos i think it be handle very well q you change a thing if -- mr. stephanopoulos change what q the way the white house handle any part of it -- from start to finish mr. stephanopoulos well i think an awful broad question and certainly go to have a review one of the reason for the investigation be to look for way in the future that something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them if talk specifically about the issue of the press conference no there -- make any change at all q two question first of all on her go on tv no white house people or outside medium consultant come up with this idea just very reminiscent of what you guy do during the campaign mr. stephanopoulos how so q think of like watch clinton on nightline after the draft story watch clinton on -- mr. stephanopoulos there 's absolutely no comparison yesterday there be a law enforcement incident the incident end in tragic death of many many people the attorney general be involve in that decision the attorney general make the decision to do that she felt it be her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the question of the press in order to make sure that all of the question be answer and she do a fantastic job q the second question be do -- a someone who know clinton a well a you do can you understand why sort of hard to believe that he might not have ask some detailed question about what she intend to do in other word she come and she say go to put pressure on them hard not to see clinton who 's fairly intelligent and inquisitive ask how q what kind mr. stephanopoulos both the attorney general say that he do ask question he do ask general question i have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation q how long a conversation mr. stephanopoulos i think it be about 15 minute q telephone conversation mr. stephanopoulos yes q george be the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in term of step up the pressure -- mr. stephanopoulos i believe so no q george you keep say that the president take full responsibility but then you refer to it a her decision do the president not accept the fact that a commander-in-chief it be ultimately his decision mr. stephanopoulos i know what this have to do with commander-in-chief this be a law enforcement action not a military action and he clearly take responsibility for the decision of the law enforcement agency involve take in his government i mean i think there 's just no ambiguity about that q but be he accept it a his decision a well a hers or be he say her decision there 's a difference mr. stephanopoulos a a matter of fact it be her decision he do not object to that decision he clearly take full responsibility q george this briefing have go on just a little over 15 minute and a you can see a lot of thing can be exchange what exactly do they spend 15 minute talk about if it be just very general a long period of time in a phone conversation mr. stephanopoulos it be an awful long phone conversation it be a very important phone conversation i think brit have ask that we take the question and say that i would q one of the thing reno say last night be that the buck stop here i think that be her direct quotation do the president agree with that in this case mr. stephanopoulos the president say he accepts full responsibility i think what the attorney general be say be that she make a decision that s go to accept all the responsibility that come to her and s not shrink from that at all but neither be the president q at any point in the conversation last night between the president and the attorney general or this morning do she ever offer her a resignation mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge q even before the fire be out yesterday there be some republican on capitol hill call for an investigation be the white house at all concerned about the timing of those request try to make political hay out of this situation mr. stephanopoulos no and i want to cast any question about the motif of those who be request investigation we want an investigation and have a full and complete investigation q in what forum will you answer br question will you put out a write statement will you -- the wire how will you answer the question that take mr. stephanopoulos just not sure q george can you remind u what the president be do all yesterday afternoon where he be and what meeting he be involve in mr. stephanopoulos i 'll have to try and remember he have a series of meeting with different member of the staff during the afternoon he be certainly monitoring the situation in waco and get periodic report on that a well he do see some on cnn a well i believe he saw a fair amount of the fbi press briefing a well q and those report would have come to him from mack mclarty would they -- do you think mr. stephanopoulos mack talk to him bruce talk to him i talk to him q george to follow helen 's question in their conversation this morning do they discus at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign do he say i know why you felt the need to say that here to reassure you that you have to do this do that come up at all mr. stephanopoulos i know if it even come up that specifically i know that the bulk of the conversation be discuss where do we go from here and what form the investigation -- q the talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about -- mr. stephanopoulos well i believe she be ask a question q and her response be if the president want me to i will mr. stephanopoulos which would be i think the standard response that most cabinet member would give i mean a conditional statement q have a need to talk about whether -- personally about whether the president want her -- mr. stephanopoulos i know if they talk about it i mean what i learn about the conversation be that it be largely about the investigation itself and this just come up i do not ask the question if they talk about -- q will you take that with the brit package mr. stephanopoulos certainly laughter q george for the record do the president want her to resign i know dee dee answer this morning -- mr. stephanopoulos absolutely not he support janet reno s a good attorney general s do a good job she handle a difficult situation extremely well q george do the president feel that he and janet reno be let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement expert on the ground mr. stephanopoulos no and the president be not second-guessing that decision and those recommendation in any way that be not to say that he regret the loss of life everybody regret the loss of life in this situation but the best judgment be make in a difficult situation base on the best information we have q george the 15-minute conversation be the one on sunday be that correct mr. stephanopoulos yes q how long be the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning mr. stephanopoulos i know i 'll take that question too q be these outside expert that they be consult with or expert within the atf and the fbi mr. stephanopoulos have to ask them just not sure i know that there be several expert q and also why there replacement for these people be the unit that small mr. stephanopoulos again i think it be a very small highly-specialized unit but i think one of the kind of thing that the investigation will examine q george there a factor here involve the fbi director normally a president when he want to get information only asks the attorney general i know the chain of command but president talk to their fbi director in this case throughout this entire siege he have not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to bill session who be from waco and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do mr. stephanopoulos i think he talk to the fbi director well in the begin of the situation when it first broke out in waco at the same time the attorney general bear the ultimate responsibility and he be get fully briefed from the attorney general q you think the ambiguous situation that director session be in have some impact on the way the president be briefed and on the way that all of this evolve mr. stephanopoulos not at all i mean perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the attorney general and that the attorney general have supervisory authority over the fbi director and follow the chain of command the press thank you end 1:03 p.m. edt"
b'your post be base on the premise that the law a they stand do not discriminate anybody so your argument fall over immediately be you really that dumb a to use emotive language to prove an argument please feel free to answer that be if you have anything intelligent to say on the matter'
b'seem like those responsible for the assault be very concerned about the welfare of the child inside seem like they be more interested in flex their muscle before the medium my reason just ask yourself this one question suppose the scenario be slightly different and we have chelsea clinton be kidnap by terrorist hole up in a compound for 51 day do you think clinton reno the fbi and the atf would be so eager to use a show of force nuff say -- richard mulac ck347 cleveland.freenet.edu'
b"sorry but have to differ the canadian-bashing wrt to the health insurance system be largely with little evidence or prompt have kept up with this debate on the net for some month just about all the criticism of the canadian system have misquote or misinterpret even the anti-canadian propaganda put out by the american insurance industry and the ama in a few case such a mr. case the critique be well-reasoned and worthy of response most others be misinform illogical or just plain dumb i think the same can be say of the `` american proponent '' of the canadian system much less of the canadian proponent jsh"
b"saw it in t.p.m. thanks yes and the individual be not omit i just fully articulate the principle of fractal federalism all government power derive from the people each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process where a true consensus say a 3/4 majority writes that power into the constitution of the level above in the case of the low level an amendement be pass by a 3/4 majority vote in the case of high level it must be pass by 3/4 of the legislature we can of course haggle about the specific of `` true consensus '' when we hold our constitutional convention once a power have be grant it may be exercise by the legislature power not in the original constitution must percolate upward start from the individual the ratification process for the original constitution should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority grant a `` right '' in a constitution be of course the same a empower the government at that level to restrict the activity of the government at the low level so it operates in the same way a the amendment process again that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual u.s. government structure this government structure be a very frustrate one for those people read- '' liberal '' who would like to have concentrate power to use the government to force people to do `` good '' a difficult-to-define word and one that it be difficult to reach a consensus on it be also a frustrate structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior read- '' big-government conservative '' i personally would rather see those type of people frustrate than the incredible erosion of liberty both civil and economic that be go on now this be imho a `` good '' government stucture for those who see the role of government a the protection of individual liberty while still recognize that individual need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in one which maintains peace liberty and the opportunity for happiness for it people while work within the reality of human nature you do bring up the point intentional or not that a `` last '' idea be by no mean necessarily a `` successful '' idea i believe that fractal federalism would at least bring many idea to light and the people would have the opportunity to democratically choose between `` good '' idea and `` bad '' idea if the docialists er i mean democrat be right and government activism foster a prosperous people they will have a plethora of local opportunity to check their thesis if libertopia be possible it will arise if a balance conservative republic be democratically receive a the best level of government activity it will become clear to the people that it be best right and people would not rescind any freedom read- `` empower the government '' except through the amendment process that be how the federal government be suppose to work now but the supreme soviet er i mean the supreme court put a stop to that `` republican government '' nonsense in my hypothetical government if there be a constitutional provision empower the government to regulate church the government whatever level we be talk about could indeed ban church the constitutional provision would be invalid if a high level have a constitutional provision protect free exercise of religion the uppermost constitution be still the supreme law of the land it be a matter of individual be able to control their own association and environment not a matter of suppression of idea one dilemma of the human condition be that individual need liberty and they also need to have some control over their environment in my '' fractal federalism '' government certain `` right '' be protect by the constitution other `` right '' be protect simply because the government have not be empower to infringe upon them when a consensus be reach that the government should have a certain power then freedom be infringe upon this can not be avoid -- murder statute infringe upon freedom but i think that the consensus of the american people be that murder statute be a good idea i be sure that many parent believe that they have a `` right '' to control the environment that their child live in people feel that they have a `` right '' to sleep peacefully at night thus there be noise ordinance there be zone law that keep business from overrun residential neighborhood i do not view these a bad thing certainly some individual instance be bad but the concept be not necessarily bad i view them a the people in a community have some control over the type of community that they live in i see the alternative a near anarchy like i say in another post if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero effect on anyone else -- then no individual or government have the right to restrict that activity there be simply not very many behavior that fit into the category of the truly autonomous so the whole thing becomes an issue of one individual or group have power over another individual or group i think that the `` fractal federalism '' approach be a sound if not ideal approach to limit this restrictive power the libertarian scenario degenerate to `` might make right '' and the system we have right now be one of `` lawyer abuse natural right philosophy to decide what power the government should have by subvert the democratic process though the supreme court '' i think i answer this above already but let me expand a little more with an example if i stand naked in front of your house and masturbate in front of your child while they play in your libertarian small l scenario the only recourse you have be to yell at me `` autonomous '' be a value judgement 99.99 of the time it be not a scientific reality with a clear definition exactly who would you empower to make that value judgement lot of people be long on complaint and short on practical solution although i be pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit i be at least try to be long on solution also i be truly interested if you have any improvement to make on my idea i call them `` my idea '' but they all come from an `` average guy '' reading of the u.s. constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of constitutional law academia sorry the confusion be my fault when i say that `` fractal federalism '' resembles the u.s. constitution i meant it and thought it be pretty clear i should have more clearly explain that the ultimate derivation of government power be from the consensus of the people although not the consent of every individual a practical observation not a moral judgement it be certainly well than have all government power derive from nine lawyer which be the situation we have now that be why i think the supreme court should be a jury court with a different jury for each case it be certainly not perfect no philosophy of government be but do you still find it a repugnant idea if so what be your solution i think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government i advocate and it be my fault for not be more clear the majority do not make the rule the majority or possibly a plurality simply elect representative to exercise limited government power those limited government power derive from a large consensus not a simple majority and the federal government in my scenario still have the power to protect freedom matt freivald -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

b"i thumbed through the janus report in a bookstore recently look for a clue about their methodology they be very unclear about it but a far a i could tell they rely on their professional associate in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subject interview and number if so this would hardly represent an average cross-section i post to usenet at the time ask for more data about their methodology but answer come there none i must have be out of my mind for even ask for factual information on usenet this be the problem people have to have a lot of confidence in the anonymity of a study before they can count on to speak freely about stuff like that but i agree that if someone 's go to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claim to be straight rather than the other way around i see why there 's any more evidence for this figure than any other it seem totally arbitrary"

b"a very well put together post i disagree with several key point but the post be an excellent one with which to `` engage in discourse '' there have be much discussion recently about the right to freedom of association mr. cramer and mr. ronzone appear to take an absolutist position on this right -- that it be a fundamental human right perhaps the fundamental human right and that it supersedes other right such a the right to an equal opportunity others feel that a right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and thus we have the never-ending debate that flare up repeatedly freedom of association foa involves the mutual and voluntary agreement of two or more people right to equal opportunity let call it reo involves coercion in all case by definition a major problem be that neither of these right be explicitly declare or protect in the constitution or in the declaration of independence although both can be derive from these document unfortunately this mean that the debate will never end because neither side can conclu- sively prove the validity of their view -- it becomes solely a matter of personal philosophy yes there be much debate but no it can end with once and for all recognition of these right well not totally 100 perfect end but end in the same way that there be no worldwide disagreement that say murder be a crime my personal opinion be that the real answer lie somewhere in between i regard both of these right a fundamental human right which unfortu- nately come into direct conflict with one another which be strong depends on the give situation hmm there be even more discusion about religion should we take a '' somewhere in between '' approach towards the state a state recognize religion the first amendment be so uh so absolutist you know for example if the owner of a `` mom-and-pop '' store wish to hire an employee to help out their right to freedom of association outweighs the right of their job applicant to an equal opportunity they should be free to hire whomever they choose use whatever criterion they choose without any government intervention at all similarly if a family wish to rent out a bedroom in their home or a garage apartment or something similar then their right to freedom of association outweighs the right of their prospective tenant to an equal opportunity if on the other hand ibm a multi-national corporation with 275,000 employee publicly own and operate by a board of director wish to hire additional employee then whose freedom of association be we protect the board of director the other employee the owner of the stock in this case the applicant 's right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we a a society can ask ibm to use only those criterion which be relevant to the specific task why say who why can mon pop have foa but ibm be force and force be the correct word here to have reo a purchase of ibm be voluntary then there be very well define procedure on how ibm chooses to do some thing and chooses to do other thing why not let those same procedure work for employment policy similarly if a landlord own a number of apartment building in which he do not live and which be manage by an independent management agency then whose freedom of association be we protect if the owner do not live in his building and have no contact with his tenant then the prospective tenant 's right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we a a society can ask the owner to use only those criterion which be relevant to `` good '' tenant put `` good '' in quotation mark because i really want to be drawn off into the side issue of what constitutes a good tenant why do this tenant have an `` option '' i call it a right to destroy the foa of the landlord if the landlord and the tenant agree then they both can cease from use each other 's property suddenly by arm wave by magic a landlord do not have foa and on what basis do the foa of the landlord `` disappear '' it seem that vague term like `` no contact with tenant '' suffice well i think foa be one our most important rightts in the top 2-3 and by golly if the state be go to make it suffer i sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right i think `` no contact '' with the tenats be even a crime much less something that should cause severe interference with important right i suspect that the majority of the people in this country agree with my position on these extreme case particularly if they be present in this manner i know if mr. ronzone or mr. cramer would agree -- i suspect not in any case additional problem arise when we try to apply guideline for the middle ground what if the company have 10 employee or 100 or 1000 where do we draw the line between protect the right to freedom of association and protect the right to an equal opportunity right be not define by majority/mob choice foa be an absolute reo be a fancy name for thuggery for racism and coercion the difficulty be that any line we draw will of necessity be artificial and any legislation result will be flaw in the past the government have usually try to pas law which refer to the number of employee hire by the company -- e.g. any company with more than xxx employee be affected by the law those with few be unaffected of course it would be you dimly see that the line must be artifiacial because foa be the only right just like a state religion -- you jsutify that either generally i believe that if we do not have any regulation affect these right then the right to freedom of association will be strong on the other hand many of the regulation protect the right to an equal opportunity too much weaken the right to freedom of association i believe there be a satisfactory solution which will please everybody a solution that i come up with be to use publicly own vs. privately own a the divide line if the company remains privately own then the owner should be free to do whatever they want with their company if the company becomes publicly own then the public have a right to ask the company to submit to additional regulation why i assume that when you say `` publicly own '' you be talk about those quasi-state company that do not have shareholder the company on the fortune 500 for example be all privately own they can give you a list of all of their owner they have no `` anonymous '' unknown to them owner by the way the above analysis be base on the assumption that the right to freedom of association and the right to an equal opportunity be both fundamental human right of equal importance since this be entirely a matter of faith not subject to any `` proof '' i do not choose to even try to establish this you either accept it or you any comment foa can be derive by any two rational people on a basis that neither have evil malicious or murderous intent towards the others in short agreement be mutual or not at all your reo on the other hand life only by accept coercion the gun into the situation and that be self-destructive of the whole argument because it be base only on might make right sort of like say `` nobody have a right to live '' whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument -- there be actually people that still believe love canal be some kind of environmental disaster weird eh"

b"certainly many religious belief seem to be positive principle for everyday living indeed i believe it be the islamic religion which avoids alcohol i apologize if i name the wrong religion and that be certainly a physical positive in many respect however this prof nothing just because something be a `` basic pragmatic principle of day-to-day living '' today mean it evolve from the same especially those belief and mostly position held base on interpretation of the religion religious belief come from many place but most will be back up after many level of argument to `` because how it be write '' or `` god say ...

imagine about childhood sexuality kinsey have report a fact child be indeed erotic being from the cradle `` these data on the sexual activity of young male provide an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality a a component that be present in the human animal from early infancy '' he conclude without raise eyebrow in 1948. then along come judith reisman ignorng the legitimacy of kinsey 's inquiry she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington she be appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayal of prepubertal orgasm render by the government worker and she dare to say that kinsey be a sex criminal well be he or he let 's go to the text there be no evidence in kinsey sex and fraud -- no witness no paper noteven a trace of hearsay -- that implicates kinsey in either planning or partake in child sex experiment after 12 year on the trail reisman have uncovered just two source to back up her original charge- amazingly enough kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy kinsey's coauthor on both report to whom reisman have never spoken it turn out that her whole case rest on a few passage in the male volume iand in pomeroy 's 1972 biography title dr. kinsey and the institute for sex research after frisk every `` the '' and `` and '' in both book reisman come up with what she believe be `` smoking '' sentence to establish kinsey 's allege role in the planning she say that `` there be a hint '' in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey `` direct '' the orgasm study on kid she cite his tell-tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demand that `` writer ... test their theory ... by empirical study and statistical procedure '' then she combine this quote with kinsey 's statement that some of the observation of his pedophile source `` be continued over period of month or year until the individual be old enough to make it certain that true orgasm be involve '' put two and two together -- kinsey 's empiricism and lengthy experimentation -- she arrives at her hint but realize this dog would not hunt she devote but a single paragraph to kinsey's suppose planning before shift to the issue of his personal involvement a for the allege participation after pore over pomeroy 's biography reisman found several hidden clue suggest kinsey 's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex here the chain of reason be more complex she point out that kinsey be interested in clitoral measurement collect sperm and film sex in his attic since kinsey do indeed mislead indiana university about the purpose of his cinematography -- he say that he be film `` animal sex '' -- reisman asserts that a `` similar misrepresentation may yet apply to kinsey 's child sex experiment '' catch the `` may '' reisman be also struck by kinsey 's doubt thomas attitude toward the never before record climax of female rabbit `` kinsey accord to pomeroy be the type of person who need to see thing for himself pomeroy give the example of orgasm in the female rabbit because he have not personally witness this event kinsey have difficulty in accept it reality even on the strength of testimony from a distinguish scientist how then do kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history of a sex offender '' but of course he do not he depend on their record from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides sperm attic cumshots and climax-in-cottontail have reisman defame the legendary kinsey paul gebhard succeed kinsey a the director of the kinsey institute and now life in retirement outside bloomington reach by telephone gebhard defend the pedophile connection and deny reisman 's nasty imputation `` i understand the resistance of people like reisman to study the sexuality of child '' gebhard say more in exasperation than anger `` that be where sex begin we be happy to take data wherever we found it even though pedophile commit criminal act they be usually not violent folk they be very successful if they be one of our best source be a headmaster of a boy school who maintain a kind of alumnus club and sometimes go to the wedding of his former student a for direct experiment absurd we never told any of our subject what to do lt be against our principle almost all of the pedophile material be retrospective anyway nor do we ever conduct sex experiment with child ourselves that would have be highly inappropriate '' i ask gebhard if kinsey have ever see a child in a sexual situation `` i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and kinsey watch it '' a for kinsey 's sex life it be still shroud in confidentiality he be married to the same woman for 35 year and father four child apparently there be no huge sexual revelation although rumor of homosexuality have persist without confirmation through the year gebhard take his bos 's history back in the '40s but he refuse to discus what he know `` we never divulge anything about anybody 's history whether dead or alive '' he say reisman say no to an interview for this article on the ground that i have once work for penthouse -- not to mention the fact that we have be debate each other in various forum for the past five year in keep with our contentious history she take a swipe at me in her book for continue `` the kinsey practice of euphemize incest '' my

conspiracy theory start to sink in the sex establishment be rule by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocate the overthrow of the heterosexual norm no wonder he be have such a rough time promote the joy of simultaneous orgasm -- anything that enhance sexual compatibility between men and woman inevitably raise objection eventually eichel exchange philosophical fluid with reisman and from this union kinsey sex and fraud be born eichel 's main contribution to the book be discovery and analysis of a kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seek `` the establishment of bisexuality a the balance sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people '' which by destroy the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior `` would open the way for the second and more difficult step -- the ultimate goal of cross-generational sex sex with child '' when i press him for specific reference to back up his outrageous contention he say weakly `` you think kinsey be go to come right out and say that everybody be basically bisexual and should have sex with kid but this be implicit in the kinsey report '' meanwhile eichel be demand a congressional investigation of kinsey and his data perfect just

b"when you buy insurance where you live it be base on the local rate tourist come from say utah will find that there be a difference in what their insurance will cover fob provo and what they get stuck with at lenox hill or mount sinai if they fall ill in the big apple it would depend on where you live downtown toronto or mile 101 british columbia just like cheyenne wy vs. boston ma again geography rear it ugly head since our health care provider be private they depend on an adequate market size in order to sustain enough business since our health care professional have equivalent take-home pay to their american cousin not that be paid too little to provide service i have only hear american say that illegal ... but i could be wrong just have never heard it from a canadian source our private insurance have recently balk in quebec when the liberal propose privatize some aspect of routine care ... also our insurance be put in place when no ndp labour government be in power in any province to derail the effort 'cos they want real socialize medicine no it be optional ... a it be optional for doctor to accept it there be isolated religeous community in particular that ask for exemption and one e-mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verify for me that it be indeed negative option i guess that you can argue that there be a right to have a particular insurance but so far not come across that up north ... and i take pain to keep tab with news from home believe me they probably have orgasm when they figure that out and accord to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheon i actually have doubt that any new one have emerge since ww i ... no scratch that ... there be a few in western canada and *quite* a few in quebec a part of the post-1980 quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe de cooper- ante built a new tower by the eaton 's store at le terrace and if you be able to catch urban angel on cbs 's crimetime see it a the well-lit one with double-turrets at the top a for ontario which still dominates and anchor business up north ... canada be a very old-money kind of place and the 1989 free trade agreement saw a lot of odd alliance labour union and establishment old money who want to preserve their traditional monopoly on one side and entrepreneur and internationally orient business and professional on the other the final trudeau administration and the first mulroney government have a high percentage of nouveaux rich who knew what it be like to make your own money and that motivate the mcdonald commission under trudeau which set up brian's initiative macaroni be against free trade 'til he do a head count of his caucus after the 1984 election well you have to realize that in our society like say that `` not really national defence '' because you hire your own rambo squad instead or even opt out a a pacifist btw there be always pacifist in the news argue about their portion of tax but never people argue over health insurance alternative ... and talk about a press that be hostile to whomever be in government regardless of party one of their few redeem characteristic it seem the only way to hit at the canadian system be transient period of high demand which be more a function of the doctor monopoly 's tight fist on the licence an obvious difference be that in such a transient period the ration be of the nature of a mob battling over cabbage patch dolls^tm a see recently a oppose by ration by ability to pay ... but the former be a *transient* situation and if a large body of insured patient be to deluge the california health infrastructure the same would result -- ration among the insured population with small market there be much less flexibility when deal with our insured population than california which by the way have 1/3rd more people than canada in a much more dense area so he be correct in that the resource be fix for a particular time window or a a function of the doctor monopoly licence accord to the market steady state in either case a for be `` refuse treatment '' the government of the day would be shred to tatter if something like that be to happen canadian can be geographically bad too not realize that their health care be private while only their insurance ... too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialize medicine right a point out above ... either way the transient situation be hard to deal with since the change in the private medical care resource take place at a slow rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of disaster e.g. chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor need 4-6 year of training plus internship and specialty training why argue for deductible and copayments rather than education which be what most canadian fiscal conservative be argue for the leftist `` ah just let 'em spend '' -- yeah right also note that only a few province cover prescription under some high dollar threshold ... in most your private insurance that cover it just like in the u.s. still it all add up in the oecd measure we get the sabre feed a a replacement game on espn tonight the devil local metro ny coverage supplants the main espn game yeah a sad story and saskatchewan tory leader grant devine have be on a nonstop pr campaign to save his sorry butt the sask ndp have take a neo-conservative turn like hawke gonzalez and mitterand do the medical ira would have limited use a need a low catastrophic threshold else there 'd still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhaust their ira also singapore have a much more autocratic mentality which have seaped down into it mass if singaporean that met be any indication ... i mean any disprespect here where let you just die true ... the question be how much leeway be there between the u.s. approach and the second-most capitalist approach of canada france and germany yes many ... and pretty close to a lot of small town or not too far from a big town just take a look at a detailed atlas ... or well take a flight from pittsburgh or rochester to toronto my first time across lake ontario to nyc i be amaze by the increase in density ... and the toronto region be the densest in all of canada about time rag on my own doctor friend a to why they invest in their own private practice ... in the end their money but they choose to spend it on america 's cup pipedreams and none of my business a for `` provincially own '' ... for sure against the law in canada for government to be directly involve in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser- vations what that term actually mean be that the facility get by on public grant to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kid medical practice itself be much more conservative up north my own best friend do two clerkship at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and be no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat come first no probably socialist whiner who be offend that we have private practice ... and always have they can all take cash anyways ... so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imago government where it do not even exist ... since the french and german have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrifice their culture and value then canadian can do the same a point out above the law state that it be illegal for the *government* to provide any health service except for the military and native look nobody stop the clinic when they plan on the mri ... nobody stop them when they bought it nobody seem to be stop them from use it either much ado about nothing thank goodness that hockey playoff have start ... certain there be exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cite often on usenet do not find access to mri to be a

in brazil in june 1992 and aim to impose a system of global envionmental regulation include onerous tax on energy fuel on the population of the united state and other industrialize nation such policy initiative derive from highly uncetain scientific theory they be base on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warm follow from the burning of fossill fuel and require immediate action we do not agree a survey of u.s. atmospheric scientist conduct in the summer of 1991 confirms that there be no consesensus about the cause of the slight warm observe during the past century a recently publish research paper even suggests sunspot variability which be directly proportional to solar activity rather than a rise in greenhouse gas be responsible for the global temperature increase and decrease recode since about 1880. futhermore the majority of scientific participant in the survey agree that the theoretical climate climate model use to predict a future warm can not be rely upon and be not validate by the exist climate record yet all prediction be base on such theoretical model finally agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide level from fossil fuel burning have beneficial effect on most crop and on world food supply we be disturbed that activist anxious to stop energy and economic growth be push ahead with drastic policy without take notice of

room 9:47 a.m. edt ms. myers okay today 's schedule a you know the president jogged this morning with senator wofford at 1:15 p.m. he will have a photo opportunity in the rise garden to present the teacher of the year award at 1:30 p.m. he will meet with his principal advisor on bosnia and at 5:00 p.m. meet with president vaclav havel there will be a photo op at the top of that meeting no formal press conference afterwards any question q be he move towards some major decision this week on bosnia ms. myers a say continue to discus his option be talk extensively with his foreign policy advisor his bosnia advisor a well a with other world leader try to contact president mitterrand again today and continue to discus it we have any specific timetable but obviously the situation there be very serious q have he call janet reno today or yesterday ms. myers i believe spoken to her today q why do he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that be put out last night at 6:40 p.m. ms. myers he do he answer a question about it yesterday q before anything have happen ms. myers before anything happen he put out -- q since something have happen have nothing to say ms. myers put out a statement on it last night and have more to say about it later today q in what forum be that go to be ms. myers it will be at the photo in the rise garden q he will talk about waco at that ms. myers yes have something to say q be that something we can take live ms. myers i think it will be brief we can talk a little later about the exact structure a we work it out but i know if something want to take live q will he take question on waco at that time a well ms. myers probably take a few q be there any reason why he talk to the attorney general ms. myers i 'll have to double-check i know that he talk to her this morning q and she come here this morning to see him or anyone else ms. myers no q and he talk yesterday q what 's the reaction to her resignation statement that she make last night ms. myers she be ask a question about it and she answer the question the president have absolutely no intention of ask for the attorney general 's resignation he stand behind her 100 percent a you know he be inform about the decision he take full responsibility for that and stand 100 percent behind attorney general reno q the question now arises -- yesterday we be told that he be briefed on this but we never get a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan be and the justification for the plan and the justification of the timing be he fully inform on all of that all of this about the increase level of violence inside the compound that make them want to go now the feel that nothing else be go to succeed et cetera ms. myers he talk with the attorney general about the decision about -- she talk to him about the factor that lead to her decision he raise no objection he support her decision to go forward with it he be fully briefed q of course hindsight be 20-20 but look back now do the president do the white house feel that the decision he sign off on prove to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happen ms. myers i think everybody feel bad when life be lose but i think that that be reason to second-guess the decision he stand behind the decision that be make he be inform about it he be fully briefed about it and he stand 100 percent behind the attorney general the justice department and the fbi a difficult operation and there 's -- it have already go on for more than seven week four federal agent have lose their life in the line of duty -- let 's not forget that this be a very difficult situation and all the decision involve be very difficult but all the agent on the ground the fbi the justice department all recommend move forward with this they thought give the circumstance it be the best possible course of action there 's just no point in second- guess those decision now i think that there 's a reason -- q why not they have to -- ms. myers no not to second-guess the decision i think important to take a look at it to have an investigation i think the president will talk some about that later today but at this -- from this vantage point to second-guess those decision not useful q you sound like go to order an investigation of what happen and whether -- ms. myers i think have more to say about that later yes q he will order an investigation ms. myers have more -- yes -- have more to say about an investigation q what kind of investigation ms. myers have more to say about it later q but in the monday morning quarterback surely there be some soul-searching now a to whether it be the right decision you say that we do the best we could when it turn out to be a rather -- a debacle ms. myers i think -- obviously review the situation and all the factor that lead to a very tragic outcome i think anybody dispute that the outcome be tragic but again the president stand behind the decision that be make and take a look at the factor that contribute to that q what be the fbi director 's role in this ms. myers well he be obviously involve in set up the operation he sign off on it a do the agent that be on the ground that be work with him i believe he spoke to the president but i 'll double-check that q but he be very closely involve in every aspect of planning and so forth ms. myers i would refer you to the fbi on exactly what aspect he be involve with q will janet reno be come over to the white house today ms. myers there 's no plan meeting i believe that s be here q she be at this event at 1:15 p.m. ms. myers no no plan to be q do you think that there 's go to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in term of -- to the president 's detriment politically ms. myers well i would certainly hope that people try to use this tragedy for political reason obviously i think again that useful to look at the fact to reevaluate the fact and i think the president will move forward with that but i think people understand that this be a difficult series of decision that it be a very difficult situation that it be cause by a man who be a cult leader who be involve in the death of four federal agent and i think most tragic that a lot of innocent child lose their life in this i think anybody dispute the tragedy of the outcome q dee dee what be the white house role in handle the i guess public relation aspect in the aftermath who be talk -- who here at the white house be talk with people at justice to set up reno 's news conference to do all that sort of thing ms. myers i think the attorney general handle her end of the situation herself and make the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there be a point at which there be enough information i think to talk with some accuracy about what have transpire during the day obviously people here at a number of level be keep in touch with people at the justice department and at the fbi to try to keep inform about what be happen there q but reno say that she talk to the president and there seem to be an indication she talk to anybody at the white house so who -- ms. myers there be people talk on a staff-to- staff level q i understand but who at the justice department be handle that for reno who be talk to the white house ms. myers there be a number of people a you know webb hubbell be the liaison to the white house and i know he talk to a number of people here there be a number of people at a number of different level involve i want to get into exactly who have what conversation with whom but there be a number of conversation obviously the justice department be work to keep the white house inform the press inform to the best of it ability a event unfolded throughout the day q do webb hubbell talk to the president ms. myers i believe so i know if he talk -- he may have at one point q and be the white house role just to seek information about what happen or be it to direct the public information campaign that follow ms. myers it be both to keep abreast of the situation so the president could be on top of it but i think the justice department manage it press relation on it we be obviously very interested in what be happen there throughout the day and the president be follow it very closely throughout the day q dee dee on that though if the president be follow it so closely and he have talk the night before with janet reno why he talk to her at all since then ms. myers again i know if talk to her this morning again kept fully aware of what have be go on throughout the day he stand 100 percent behind her decision be fully supportive of her a he say yesterday morning before event transpire and yesterday afternoon in a write statement q but he want to convey those thought to her personally yesterday ms. myers one more time i know if they 've spoken this morning q no yesterday q clearly there 's a perception that she be left hung out to dry all day yesterday ms. myers just not true i think we say throughout the day that the president take full responsibility that he stand -- i know how much clearer we can be the president stand foursquare behind the attorney general on this he accepts full responsibility for the event that transpire he believe that janet reno the justice department and the fbi act a best they could give the circumstance and the fact that be evident at the time i know what else he can say to show that he support her 1,000 percent q one of the best indication of that be to pick up the phone and tell her ms. myers again i know whether they 've spoken this morning q why we find out ms. myers well we can i do it stand here right now q get six people here all they 've get to do be pick up the phone ms. myers helen get back to you q dee dee when the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday be it safe to assume that either she volunteer or he inquire about whether there be a possible downside to increase pressure on the davidians ms. myers i think that they discuss the situation again not go to get into the specific detail of what exactly she told him but i think that he be aware of the risk involve q dee dee the president yesterday morning say it be entirely her decision she then say that she told him what be happen and he say okay do the president regard it that he give the go-ahead or that she give the go-ahead ms. myers i think what they both say yesterday be that she make a decision base on all the available fact she inform him about that and he raise no objection again i know how much clearer we can be about that q and he say okay the issue be over the responsibility ms. myers he say okay q do okay mean -- ms. myers the president accepts ultimate responsibility q dee dee the president 's investigation that go to announce -- would that be conduct by someone outside the administration ms. myers no q it would be internal -- be it meant to preclude any congressional investigation ms. myers no meant simply to follow up on the incident that occur yesterday q and you would i assume therefore cooperate fully with any congressional hearing that would be held ms. myers to the best of our ability q dee dee there be two report out this morning one that the justice department or fbi or whomever apparently have a bug plant inside the complex and the other be that the child may have be inject with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even kill them before the fire what do you know about those two -- ms. myers nothing more than see in news account this morning we may get more on it later but at this point i know -- not sure anybody know any more than what be report by people who come out of the compound q have the president receive any report today in term of fatality and actually what be go on -- what they 've be able to find out on in the compound now ms. myers be briefed i think that they 've gotten into the compound yet they be still wait for it to cool off i think there 's much beyond what 's be report in the news account but he have be kept up-to-date on it q dee dee the president stand behind attorney general reno but do he feel that she perhaps get bad advice from the so-called expert ms. myers he believe that she make -- he stand behind the decision that she make it be the unanimous decision of her advisor of the fbi of the agent on the ground and he support that q what about the validity of the decision make on the ground do he back those -- ms. myers not go to second-guess decision make q dee dee you just say he stand behind the decision which she make normally in a situation like this the president say i make the decision but say she make the decision ms. myers say that the president be briefed about the decision he okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it q but then why do you keep use the terminology the decision that she make rather than the decision that he make -- ms. myers because a he say yesterday she evaluate the fact base on evidence present to her by justice department and fbi which be part of the justice department and make a decision and then briefed the president on that decision that be how the chain of command work she briefed him he sign off on it the operation go forward and the president accepts full responsibility q in that chain of command analogy there i want to go back to session a moment do you know if this be a plan that come through him to reno or be it present to her around him or with his involvement what be his involvement ms. myers again have to go to the justice department for the specific interaction between the attorney general and the director q do the president stand behind director session ms. myers he support -- again i know how many different way i can say this -- he support the decision make by the justice department and the fbi he fully support the attorney general in this not step away from the director of the fbi i want to -- but janet reno be the one who briefed him the one who make the decision a the head of the justice department a you know the director of the fbi report to the attorney general the attorney general make the decision she inform the president about those decision he okayed it he raise any objection to it and he accepts full responsibility q do you have base on what you know here at the white house any concern about william session performance during this -- ms. myers nothing to suggest that no q along those same line just in your initial review of the situation how much do you think the problem might have come from not have a justice department fully staffed and have an fbi director who be still quite uncertain about his status ms. myers i just think that have anything to do with it i think the agent on the ground -- the operation go forward not go to speculate on that q do the white house express any alarm that janet reno chose to speak to the live network medium before she chose to speak to clinton ms. myers no she be carry forward her responsibility to inform the public about the event of yesterday i think she do a very admirable job the president agrees with that q before sunday how often be the president briefed on the situation in waco ms. myers he be kept update on a regular basis on a daily basis q who briefed the president ms. myers well not go to get into exactly who what conversation he have with whom but he be kept up-to-date on the event in waco he have daily briefing on a number of issue q no no be this a regular briefing conduct by a white house staff person or be it by a justice department person ms. myers briefed regularly by a white house staff on a number of issue again not go to get into exactly who brief him on what subject q another subject q on another subject q now go to do gay in the military laughter ms. myers i welcome it q how close be you to signing the biodiversity treaty ms. myers a you know the president 's give a speech on earth day tomorrow have more to say about it then q any detail on where or when that speech be yet ms. myers at 11:30 a.m. and i know where yet q dee dee be this a major policy address how would you characterize the speech tomorrow ms. myers i would characterize it a a earth day speech i look for any major departure from his past position on these thing but again i want to get too much into what go to talk about tomorrow q on or off campus q be this at a location outside the white house ms. myers it will be somewhere in washington we know exactly where yet q dee dee what foreign leader have the president talk to since friday on the situation in bosnia ms. myers only prime minister major and again try to reach president mitterrand again this morning q david owen say yesterday and joe biden say today -- both of them agree that the peace process be not go to work that the serb be not go to sign on do the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on ms. myers obviously the ultimate goal be some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in bosnia a you know the administration be consider a wide variety of option at this point the situation there in and around srebrenica and the rest of eastern bosnia be quite serious and the president will meet with his bosnian advisor today and continue to press forward on this q be that a question go to try to be decide whether or not the peace plan remains viable ms. myers again be review a number of option include the peace plan q do the group that meeting with today include reg bartholomew ms. myers i believe here but it will be among the usual -- secretary christopher secretary aspin general powell q dee dee do you have anything on the apparent encounter by u.s. f-15s over bosnia today -- some aircraft violate the no-fly zone ms. myers no i i 'll get back to you on that q will the president be meeting with every one of the leader come to town for the holocaust museum ms. myers he will be meeting a you know with vaclav havel today and with lech walesa tomorrow and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon q a a group or one by one ms. myers i believe a a group now havel and walesa ask for meeting early and these have be on the agenda for quite some time but he will meet with all of the foreign head of state that be here q dee dee have the president decide whether he support the gay and lesbian civil right act and have anything be work out for him to address the march on sunday ms. myers i think probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march we work out the exact detail of that q not a live phone hook-up ms. myers probably not give the logistics of get to boston the speech a you know be at 4:00 p.m. the answer to the other part of your question be no he take a position on it q you say that speech in boston be at 4:00 p.m. ms. myers i believe so yes q do you know what on ms. myers still work out -- q general vessey 's come back tonight from vietnam when will he be meeting with the president ms. myers no specific meeting be schedule talk to him at some point and see we look forward to his report but exactly how make that report be unclear q so not go to come immediately to the white house ms. myers no q the aid czar -- how close be you ms. myers still work on it q drug czar q do you expect it before the march ms. myers i have a time line on it q do the president ask senator mitchell to try the lloyd cutler ploy to break the filibuster ms. myers i believe so q why not ms. myers just not go to q be senate democrat here at this hour ms. myers no tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. q update on the stimulus possible scale down -- ms. myers a you know the senate will vote on amendment today continue to talk the president be commit to some kind of a job package like to see it pass and continue in conversation throughout the day and see where we end up q when this briefing be over can you give u word through the speaker or whatever whether the president 's talk to janet reno ms. myers be happy to q become a press question for the last several hour ms. myers no just this minute that be here and i have a chance to follow up on it helen q do he have an opinion on hatfield ms. myers i mean obviously he prefers -- he offer a compromise package of 12.2 billion he believe that the best alternative believe that obviously willing to take a second look at the package and i think the senate will vote on that today and hopeful that the president 's bill which will be the mitchell amendment will be the one that will be approve q dee dee be there any white house official that will be at the march on sunday ms. myers somebody will be there represent the president i know who yet q well have it be decide how go to address be it go to be a videotape or a phone call ms. myers i think it will probably be a letter but there be a final decision on that yet q the official

b"our doctor monopoly be exactly the same a in the u.s. if not more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rate but i know an answer to this one anecdotally my friend who be md 's include my main bud from high school talk about how hard it be to turn `` state 's witness '' against someone else ... no direct experience there though well what american private insurance plan cover travel expense since our public insurance plan be publicly accountable one can raise a stink in the medium to try and extort benefit beyond which one be entitle hey not alberta 's fault that he life there ... if he live in cheyenne wy his private insurance would 've told him to go to hell for the travel expense and that an hmo would have just kept quiet and let him go blind i think that this have be show with the dmc ... regular practice in a hospital to figure out who need to get at what facility american have to arrange in advance for operation too i think that there be two standard be apply here and that canada give beverly hills-style treatment to everybody not a big brother list ... more like call around town for a table for dinner ... yes and the tory in ottawa be try to make them do that rather than hope for a big grant from the fed and their province the next time around whether use mop a couple of week longer or even sell service to american remember our system be cash base and since our health care infrastructure be overbuilt except in specialty that require large population to generate business why not the alternative be closing unused ward ... business. you answer the question yourself ... `` private nonprofit foundation have to make money somehow '' and i think that about time that they act like the private hospital that they be personally fed up with canadian socialist try to tell everyone that their health care be free when we be actually buying insurance one at you bob rae since we have always be evaluate in an oecd style i see how ... remember oecd count both private and public fund and in canada like france and germany 30 of health care spending be private fund i.e. not the basic health insurance money minor copayments can flush out abuser remember that our `` system '' be only an insurance policy but our cost rise fast enough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year quebec 's user-fee proposal come out with the number of `` 5 '' a the necessary hike that could be do through a copayment rather than give the qma a raise and not contract time yet a far a i can tell from upi clarinet ... even the new reform party a breakoff of traditionalist from the conservative with a mildly `` libertarian '' faction hold our public health insurance a an untouchable but that just a few people have to be remind that not free the average canadian/european be more fiscally naive than their american counterpart on issue like these but no mention of copayments anywhere to be see ... but cut public spending all over the place and bring back the death penalty with little haste if elect sorry just that i even run into people from buffalo and from michigan who know ... yeah but there 'd be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisis that would preclude it if provincial government a bad a some of them be heck we have the ndp cleaning up a spending mess make by the conservative in saskatchewan embarassing can be so irresponsible there be still reallocation -- health insurance be so important that about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent insurrection outside of the hockey rink right now attempt to get the system and it user to learn good habit be be treat like cod-liver oil ... most american be fearful of a single-tier system ... seriously there be few area that have sufficient population for a two/more-tiered system like what the french have ... a health policy prof d.g shea have cite study in the nejm that indicate have a population of 500,000 be necessary for adequate competition ... and in canada there be only four city west of the great lake with that population or large anyways the number show that cost have held steadier than those in the u.s. and bar any future chernobyl-like crisis sudden transient in spending be unlikely in fact the health allocation be one of the most well-behaved sector of spending up north so any talk of bankruptcy be talk-radio fodder far away from the border this be overnight and something like this would force canada to have a system more like the french one ... but not a bad thing and the change will be minimal i.e. add copayments and frustrate the socialist chant `` hey *free* '' gld"

error of endow the nine lawyer on the supreme court with an almost totalitarian authority completely outside of the consent or consensus of the people this be why supreme court nomination be such amaze political fist-fights these day because he who control the court rule the country the people on the court may well be try to do the best job they can but they be at best a benevolent oligarch even if you approve of every supreme court decision ever eventually an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear try supreme court case by jury and the problem would be mitigate

then i would have to vote with my foot and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of value this be not an ideal situation but it be far well than the mess we be mire in right now when

room 10:35 a.m. edt ms. myers at 1:00 p.m. have a press conference bill in the east room and then saturday the president will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to jamestown he will spend the day there overnight at camp david on sunday unclear exactly what time leave camp david and fly to boston leave from hagerstown the press plane will leave from washington he will meet with some -- q what kind of a plane be that take ms. myers that take probably take a c- 20. q from hagerstown ms. myers from hagerstown air force one fly out of hagerstown apparently q how will the pool travel ms. myers the pool will have to meet him ahead of time so i guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport there be currently no provision -- and i 'll double-check because there 's currently no provision -- i think standard operating practice q the pool be not go to meet him and watch him get on the plane at hagerstown ms. myers i believe so q what time do he have to be in boston ms. myers go to meet there with a group of citizen mostly people who support u during the campaign at around 1:30 p.m. still work out the final time q at the airport ms. myers no it will be at the boston harbor hotel and then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that author something call project 21. the speech to the publisher be actually at 3:15 p.m. it will be follow by q a and then after the speech and q a attend a reception with the publisher and then return to washington from boston and it for the weekend q have the president see the report from -- or the letter communication from the foreign service officer also obviously the communication from madeleine albright and what be his reaction to their call on him ms. myers well obviously the letter be write to secretary christopher i believe secretary christopher receive the letter on saturday he review it and met with the author on monday to discus their view he believe an important part of the policy-making process and be take their view into account a we go forward in the development of the bosnia policy q what be the president 's reaction ms. myers the president see the letter it be something that be direct towards secretary christopher in term of -- he see specifically the letter but in term of their concern generally what the president have say be that there be a lot of option on the table now include one that there before and i think a be everybody gravely concerned about the situation in bosnia q be he influence by that i mean how do he feel about the fact that all of the specialist in that area -- those desk officer -- ms. myers many of the specialist in that area -- i think that that be clearly part of the process something -- their view will clearly be consider i think secretary christopher met with the group immediately to discus their view i think he believe that there ought to be room for opinion and that those opinion ought to be consider particularly from people who work closely on the issue q what do you mean there be option on the table that there before ms. myers i think the president say last week that there be option such a lift the arm embargo to the bosnian muslim that have be previously off the table that be now be consider q dee dee in term of those option madeleine albright be say that potentially there could be unilateral action by the u.s. if the european do not go along be that on the table ms. myers well i discus anything that would -- any conversation that would have happen between ambassador albright and the president but i think the president have say he would certainly -- be work with our european ally have a number of conversation with european leader and be try to build some consensus there q will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today ms. myers no i mean in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today q do your statement mean he have rule out unilateral action ms. myers continue to consult with our ally at this point he have say -- i think be fairly clear about it that the he believe that the u.s. need to act in concert with it ally on this q on that point do he believe that the u.s. though do have built-in authority from the united nation already to take unilateral action ms. myers well i think the u.n. resolution 770 make it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort i think the broader point be that anything we do any option that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it be consistent with u.n. authority and if not work with our ally to make sure that we get it q dee dee then how do the white house someone a distinguish a elie wiesel who say that not enough be be do to stop the atrocity go on in bosnia ms. myers i think that why consider additional option i think that mr. wiesel 's comment yesterday be quite compelling the situation in bosnia be tragic the president be very concerned about it he have -- i think president clinton have work very hard to take far action to continue to isolate serbia in the world community clearly consider other option because the president be concerned that perhaps not enough q in term of what you be just talk about it sound like resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the u.s. to protect humanitarian -- ms. myers i think it -- i use the word justify it permit unilateral action by any country in protect the delivery of humanitarian relief but i think just an explanation of the resolution i think any action that we take will be consistent with u.n. resolution or work with our ally to make sure that it be permissible or get far action q the president and other official have rule out unilateral u.s. action in bosnia in the past decline to do that this morning ms. myers no i say the president have say repeatedly that he want to act in concert with our ally on this q that mean that he act alone which have be say before explicitly ms. myers i mean to imply a change in policy the president have say all along that he want to act in concert with our ally on this q one other little question do he know about this letter from the foreign service officer before it hit the paper ms. myers i believe so secretary christopher -- they may have have a private conversation about it the president have not see it q they met on monday right christopher met -- surely he must have brought that up -- ms. myers again they may have talk privately about it but -- q dee dee what say be that the albright recommendation have be reject be that correct ms. myers no i say that at all i say i -- i say i comment on any conversation or communication q s advocate unilateral action and say in effect that we will not take unilateral action ms. myers i be not confirm anything that madeleine albright may or may not have recommend q give the sometimes delicate complicate and frustrate nature of negotiation with the ally on this issue do the president find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service officer of the state department helpful to that process hurtful to that ms. myers i think that their view be obviously be consider the secretary receive that memo on saturday and two day later he met with them in order to have a more thorough air of their view of the basis for their view to discus in great detail the option that they have present in the letter q it put some kind of pressure on -- additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the ally may or may not do ms. myers i think clearly there 's a broad policy review underway now and the president and his advisor be consider a number of option include some of those outline in the letter from the folk over at the state department now no decision have be make on that yet but i think that there be a through review underway and that their opinion be be very seriously consider q if i can just follow up i guess what look for be what be his reaction to this letter do he say good this bolster my position or do he say damn this be just what i need right now ms. myers i think he say this help contribute substantively to the debate important that all view be consider and air thoroughly that before he make a decision he want to have the best possible advice and information possible and this i think in many way furthers that goal q so internal advice to a cabinet official or the president -- all open now and you take any umbrage or say that they be out of line ms. myers i think that the fact that secretary christopher met with them to discus their view and make sure they have an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it be conclusive evidence that their view be welcome q do the policy review include what madeleine albright have suggest and what joe biden and others have suggest which be that the previous u.n. resolution authorize unilateral action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian -- ms. myers i think all option be on the table q the unilateral option be on the table ms. myers i think all option be on the table q have two different -- q that a change dee dee q that would be a change of policy q particularly if it include ground troop which have be specifically rule out ms. myers i think the president have be -- well no i -- that be not -- q be you talk about all option ms. myers all option -- i think the president have be fairly clear about that so let me just review again what he have say he have say that -- the president have say all option be on the table with the exception of the introduction of ground troop which he have never suggest he have rule that out from the begin q he rule out unilateral action of any sort ms. myers he have say that he believe the u.s. can solve the problem in the former yugoslavia by itself i think that there be a number of very complicate option on the table right now i think that -- again i want to comment on specific option that be be consider other than in the broad category that already say -- thing like lift the arm embargo against the bosnian muslim thing that i think talk about in broad term this be a very complicate situation the option be present and consider be very complicate q air strike on the table ms. myers again i think be fairly clearly point out that something be discuss q dee dee be ground troop on the -- ms. myers no ground troop be not be consider q you say there be not go to be -- you say you be not announce a change of policy then you say everything be on the table confuse be unilateral action on the table ms. myers all i can tell you be what the president have say -- that he believe -- that he want to act in concert with the ally on this q want to but willing to -- i mean if they go along -- ms. myers continue to consult with our ally on this continue to have discussion continue to press them for far action and i think clear the conversation be ongoing go to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this q dee dee the ally have take the position that to conduct any kind of air strike in bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel that their troop on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the bosnians -- ms. myers not sure the consistent -- i mean not sure who refer to q the british and the french q yes the british and french they 've take the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strike against the bosnian military do the u.s. believe differently from that ms. myers the president have have conversation with both mitterrand and major a you know i think that there be a thorough review of policy go on in those country a well and i want to comment on the nature of the president 's discussion other than to say that continue to consult with our ally a we move forward and continue to press them for far action and i think that process be ongoing q the other day vote against any military intervention yesterday do the president regard that a the end of the line or do he do still hold out some possibility of unilateral action the ally have be very very plain that they do not want to do anything ms. myers the consultation be ongoing all i can tell you at this point q be you say that there be any announcement on bosnia today in the press conference ms. myers no that be not the intention of the press conference q what be the intention ms. myers an opportunity to take question he may have a brief -- sure have a brief opening statement but it be not an opportunity to outline a new policy on bosnia that will not happen q can you tell u what the subject of the opening statement be ms. myers sort of a general statement of where we be q after the first hundred day you mean ms. myers not a long statement i mean this be just generally look for any major policy pronouncement q do you know what the opening statement be ms. myers but -- perhaps later today i 'll be able to tell you with more certainty -- i think still under review but the override purpose of this -- not a mystery not meant to be just to take question q it would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement be on ms. myers since the major purpose here be just to take question not completely resolve yet q dee dee one policy that be expect last week and that the white house you and george seem to indicate we might get would be an aid czar will he announce that today and what 's the delay on that ms. myers i think we meant to imply -- i think we say it would happen soon i think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week it be come soon i anticipate that happen today q what 's the delay this the perfect time to announce an aid czar ms. myers i know that a delay i think the process be ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background check and to make sure that cross the t 's and dot the i 's before we make an announcement q dee dee what be zoe baird 's qualification for the foreign intelligence advisory board and why her appointment announce here ms. myers the qualification -- i know if there 's a specific list i 'll have to check and see i think there be a number of people there on the board with different background many of them have long history in intelligence or other government service i think there 's a broad variety of view across political spectrum and across background that be represent there we never make a formal announcement other than the chairman of the board which be admiral william crowe q why would he appoint her though if the american people and many in the senate reject her for another government job ms. myers i believe that the american people ever have -- vote on her and i certainly -- she be never reject in the senate she never go up there for a hearing but the president believe s a very competent person say that -- zoe baird -- do you understand what the question be zoe baird be on the president 's foreign intelligence -- q you say she never go up there for a hearing q her nomination be withdrawn after public outrage over violate federal law ms. myers right she never -- she be never -- but you say she be reject by the senate i be just simply try to point out that she be never vote on by the senate q so you think that be any problem ms. myers i think there 's any problem q she have be appoint to this board be that a fact ms. myers yes q do she need confirmation for this do she need confirmation to be a member of the -- ms. myers no a presidential appointment q usually announcement be make here at the white house be there a decision not to announce her publicly ms. myers we make an announcement people who ask be told who the member of the board be we make an official announcement if anybody 's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of name q like to know q such board member -- you normally a a matter of -- routinely put out release on all these board and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension ms. myers not always but again happy to put this out q that the standard practice q that be past practice ms. myers again happy to put it out put out a list of the member of the board today q dee dee i want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but -- laughter -- all i really want to know be it be the practice in this administration for such announcement to be make routinely ms. myers i think generally but not always and happy to put that out today q what be the board what be her title what be the size of the board ms. myers there be roughly a dozen member on the board it be a civilian board although their be some obviously retire military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the president again the chairman of that board be admiral william crowe q and do he recommend baird q what 's the name of the board ms. myers the president 's foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab q what 's her qualification -- that she have employ an illegal alien be that -- laughter -- ms. myers do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke q let me phrase it another way why this appointment be view a a pay-back for the difficulty she have a couple of month ago ms. myers because not q what 's her experience in foreign intelligence ms. myers s an experienced attorney someone who the president believe be very competent and qualify and i think part of the mission of this board be to provide civilian input not everybody on the board be suppose to be an intelligence expert that be not the board 's mission it be to provide civilian input for the president a he make decision regard intelligence matter he believe s very qualify very competent person enormously talented and have say that throughout q be this just a figment of my overactive imagination or be there discussion early on about abolish the president 's foreign intelligence advisory board ms. myers i think so on december 24th when he announce all of his foreign policy advisor he announce that he would -- have appoint admiral crowe a the head of the board so i believe there 's ever be any -- q earlier than that during the transition ms. myers no i believe so it be announce again on december 24th admiral crowe be there but it be announce q be member paid ms. myers i believe so but i 'll double-check q on another subject on waco how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal report of the autopsy of the body that be come out of waco and the state i guess the texas ranger report ms. myers most of the information be come -- the federal information be come from the site clearly there 's be some discrepancy and the justice department be look into it official in the justice department be told i believe the day before yesterday that there be several body found with bullet hole i think there 's some discrepancy about that and the justice department be look into it q be the president go to get involve in try to sort out what seem to be become a jurisdictional morass down there with some people withdraw others say in charge but others -- justice fbi texas ranger -- all grab a piece of this ms. myers i know that go to try to mediate the dispute i mean i 'll let you know if there 's anything he intend to do about it but a you know there be several level of investigation ongoing and hopeful that they can work together q be there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything ms. myers i know i 'll have to get back to you on that q what be the subject matter of sunday 's speech ms. myers go to be fairly general i think go to be any specific announcement i think go to be sort of a -- q do he have a topic that go to talk about ms. myers still work on it but i look for any announcement of like the drug czar or something like that q be it sort of a 100 day speech sort of `` my excellent adventure for 100 day '' laughter ms. myers not exactly but i think take a little bit broader look about what 's happen in the last -- q foreign domestic ms. myers a little bit of both but i think a lot of domestic q and overview ms. myers yes more of an overview than a specific policy announcement q have there be an agreement yet on a forum by which the president will address the gay right march on sunday ms. myers it will be a letter read to the crowd by congresswoman nancy pelosi q be that available ms. myers not yet but it will be sure q be you go to put it out here or -- ms. myers probably put it out here on sunday q travel next week ms. myers unclear q what be the question q likely ms. myers i -- q likely possible ms. myers possible q what 's possible ms. myers travel q george mention yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposal next week do you have day yet for them ms. myers not yet q can you tell u which order ms. myers campaign finance reform first national service later in the week q be there any coverage tomorrow in williamsburg ms. myers no q and any report in the aftermath of the day ms. myers any readout from the day q readout ms. myers possible jeff eller will be down there i think he can go through what the president do during the day we expect any photo op or anything other than departure here in the morning q dee dee the president have not make a regular practice a some of his predecessor have of go to camp david in fact be there -- what -- once or twice ms. myers twice q why this weekend ms. myers he go two weekend ago a you know on the way home from his father-in-law 's funeral i think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together a a family and this be just an opportunity to do the same q there 's no march there q it have nothing to do with the march here ms. myers no q since go to be in town sunday morning now instead of in jamestown have you thought about him make a quick pass-by fly-over -- laughter -- ms. myers fly straight to boston q fly straight

fbi and the question be whether you knew exactly what that be and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas do you have an answer on that ms. myers i i 'll check the press thank

b"when mcmanus say `` we have the world 's best medical care '' i can hardly believe refer to a system 1. that cost u 14 percent of our gdp while there a single other country in the industrialize world that spends more than 10 percent 2. that leaf 37 million of u with no coverage even though all the other system in the industrialize world cover virtually everyone 3. yet american rank near the bottom of the list in term of life expectancy childhood immunization rate infant mortality and many preventable disease 4. we pay on average about 1000 each for mri to put that in perspective they cost 177 in japan 5. the average u company spends over 2500 dollar a year per employee on health benefit seven hundred to 1500 be the range just about everywhere else how can anyone say that such a system be the best in the world the only thing the usa health care system be good at be shower well-insured patient with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharge for it and the `` private '' system of insurer and paperwork be so bloat and inefficient that it itself suck up over 100 billion dollar a year in money from every other sector of society individual government and industry of the 800 billion dollar american threw into the bottomless pit of health care cost last year the consumer 's union estimate that at least 200 billion be thrown away on overprice useless and even downright harmful test and procedure and the most bureaucratic regulate insurance system in the world there be more than 1200 different private insurer in the usa but do the '' private competition '' stimulate more efficient paperwork ask any doctor who 's have to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all the competition among hospital be drive cost up not down the competition among hospital for both doctor and patient have encourage the hospital to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment spending million on expensive machine of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle my idea of the world 's best health care system competition among specialist be drive them to perform dangerous and expensive procedure where they be very marginally helpful especially think of heart surgery and some woman 's surgery like hysterectomy and cesarean section sound like the world 's best health care system ever notice how every time someone try to bring about some real change in health care the libby start bashing canada 's system first of all hillary clinton be not advocate another canadian system i think be make abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of month where do john f. mcmanus get that idea anyway let 's say a canadian living in a small town near the usa border your child need a complicate procedure only available in city hospital the near canadian city be 6 hour west and 20 hour east and there 's an american city one hour south which way be you go to go be it because the american system be the `` best '' in the world or just for convenience it still amazes me that people seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform there be a million different way we ould restructure the system not just a choice between total government control and total private control i wish the people scream `` socialize medicine '' every time soemone want to change the current syste would inform themselves on health care issue the current system suck i want to keep provider private but that change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we reform the health care system purely private health care without any government intervention work hillary clinton be not think of nationalize provider or evern insurer how can you scream `` socialize medicine '' at her program you even know what talk about ever see clinton 's graph of project deficit versus year for the rest of the decade notice how the line fall then start increase why i 'll give you one wild guess a to which component of spending will overwhelm u if we do something about it peope just do n't get it the current health care system be a cancer which be kill our economic well-being cost be still rise 10 percent a year even a american by the ten of million go without or be force into managed-care program which be certainly pretty socialize already if you ask me a couple of month ago i post a message ask any hillary-bashers to please come forward and present no gimmick straight talk just how they would set about keep cost down i get a single answer the only thing i keep hearing from libbie organization be press release fill with evasive platitude like `` give health care back to the people '' just do you expect to do that without serious reform what be it about the current system that you would change and how would that help how can anyone read the news live under our system and not see these fault how can we deal with the deficit our city our educational system our infrastrucure aid modernize our industry etc if we quit throw away money which could be use to solve those problem america need health care reform now just sit there and hillary-bash inform yourself jim reynolds"

b'because the gun loony be fire on vehicle with 50mm amunition that have a range of 3000 meter next question the problem be of course the law that allow a bunch of rave nutter to collect a huge stack of arm in the first place the sequence of event meant that there really be no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention if the fbi have have the stomach for it they could have mount a commando type raid and attempt to save the child by shoot all the adult it really be a no win situation koresh have plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 atf officer instead he order the murder of the child in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it be neccessary to beleive the word of a man who have just murder 17 child and order the suicide/murder of his other 80 follower accord to the account give the batf attempt to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and be met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh/gun supporter claim that the batf start shoot simply do not stand up if the aft have go there to start shoot they would have go with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handgun for all practical purpose they be unarmed the b-d follower have automatic weapon the b-d seige could not be allow to go on indefinitely the b-d be quite capable of commit mass suicide and murder the child at any time a commando assault be the only other likely action that could have achieve that objective that would have be very risky order of magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige airplane and embassy be not design for defense against attack ranch apocalypse be 6 terrorist be far easy to disloge without casualty than 80. allow the siege to go on be not an option either besides the serious risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there be the question of the difficulty of keep the emmergency team on standby over a prolong period the longer the siege go on the more mentally prepared koresh and his follower would be for a prolong siege rather than go in prematurely the mistake be probably to go in too soon can you think of a well way of get the child out a 100 certain way the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this be simply rationalisation it be not enough for them to simply dismiss the government a incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decide to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately get 4 of it agent kill and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sit out in the middle of texas be shot at by religious nutter still the conspiracy theory be comfort it allows them to pretend that waco prof nothing except about how incompetent the government be in resolve a hostage crisis no govt in the world have ever face a comparable situation quite probably there be no manner in which it could be peacefully resolve the blame do not rest on the fbi it rest on the fact that koresh be allow to get so far in particular the person who tipped the b-d off in advance have the murder of 4 atf agent and 17 child on his or her conscience there be a large number of people in the u who predict the end of society preach salvation through arm security the fact be that these be the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place the next waco may not be religious nutter but a political movement a splinter group of the klu klux klan take over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and hold several hundred child hostage the only possible solution to such situation that can work be to prevent them arise no other government in the world have face such a situation this be because no other government have so carelessly allow high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah to set themselves up a dictator in their own little empire'

b"the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 23 1993 press conference by the president the east room 1:00 p.m. edt the president terry do you have a question q mr. president there 's a grow feel that the western response to bloodshed in bosnia have be woefully inadequate holocaust survivor elie wiesel ask you yesterday to do something anything to stop the fight be the united state consider take unilateral action such a air strike against serb artillery site the president well first let me say a you know for more than a week now we have be seriously review our option for far action and i want to say too let 's look at the last three month since i become president i have work with our ally and we have try to move forward first on the no-fly zone on enforcement of it on the humanitarian airdrop on the war crime investigation on get the bosnian muslim involve in the peace process we have make some progress and now we have a very much tougher sanction resolution and leon fuerth who be the national security advisor to the vice president be in europe now work on implement that that be go to make a big difference to serbia and we be review other option i think we should act we should lead -- the united state should lead we have lead for the last three month we have move the coalition and to be fair our ally in europe have be willing to do their part and they have troop on the ground there but i do not think we should act alone unilaterally nor do i think we will have to and in the next several day i think we will finalize the extensive review which have be go on and which have take a lot of my time a well a the time of the administration a it should have over the last 10 day or so i think finish that in the near future and then have a policy and announce it and everybody can evaluate it q can i follow up the president sure q do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleanse in bosnia and the holocaust the president i think the holocaust be on a whole different level i think it be without precedent or peer in human history on the other hand ethnic cleanse be the kind of inhumanity that the holocaust take to the nth degree the idea of move people around and abuse them and often kill them solely because of their ethnicity be an abhorrent thing and it be especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic group live side by side for so long together and i think you have to stand up against it i think wrong we be talk today about all of the other trouble in that region i be happy to see the violence between the croat and the muslim in bosnia subside this morning and i think make progress on that front but what 's go on with the serbian and the ethnic cleanse be qualitatively different than the other conflict both within the former yugoslavia and in other part of the region q mr. president by any count you have not have a good week in your presidency the tragedy in waco the defeat of your stimulus bill the standoff in bosnia what do you do wrong and what be you go to do differently how do you look at thing be you reassess laughter the president i really believe that the situation in bosnia -- not be a good week for the world but i know that the administration could have make it different on the stimulus package like to put it into the large context and remind you that in this 100 day we have already fundamentally change the direction of an american government we have abandon trickle-down economics abandon the policy that brought the debt of this country from 1 trillion to 4 trillion in only a decade the budget plan which pass the congress which will reduce the deficit and increase investment have lead to a 20-year low in mortgage rate dramatically low interest rate there be probably people in this room who have refinance their home mortgage in the last three month or who have have access to cheaper credit go to put ten of billion dollar course throughout this economy in way that be very very good for the country and so we be move in the right direction economically i regret that the stimulus do not pas and i have begin to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the administration but people in the congress whether there be something i could have do differently to pas that part of the reason it pas be politics part of it be a difference in idea there be really people still who believe that not need i just disagree with that i think the recovery -- the economist say be underway for about two year and still have 16 month of seven- percent unemployment and all the wealthy country be have trouble create job so i think there be an idea base -- an argument there that while wait for the low interest rate and the deficit reduction and the investment of the next four year to take effect this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward now i have to tell you i do misgauge that because a majority of the republican senator now sit in the senate vote for a similar stimulus when ronald reagan be president in 1983 and vote 28 time for regular supplemental appropriation like this i just misgauge it and i hope that i can learn something just be here 90 day and you know i be a governor work with a contentious legislature for 12 year and it take me a decade to get political reform there so it take time to change thing but i basically feel very good about what 's happen in the first 100 day with regard to the congress q waco -- the president well with regard to waco i have much to add to what already say i think it be a -- i want the situation look into i want u to bring in people who have any insight to bear on that i think very important that the whole thing be thoroughly go over but i still maintain what i say from the begin that the offender there be david koresh and i do not think the united state government be responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatic decide to kill themselves and sorry that they kill their child q mr. president to follow up partly on helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to capitol hill ross perot say today that play game with the american people in your tax policy he be strongly critical of your stimulus package he say go to launch an advertising campaign against the north american free trade agreement how be you go to handle his political criticism will it complicate your effort on the hill with your economic plan and do you plan to repackage some of the thing that have be in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the hill the president let me answer that question first go to revisit all of that over the next few day go to be talk to member of congress and to others to see what we can do about that with regard to the economic plan i must say i found that rather amaze i want to get into an argument with mr. perot i 'll be interested to hear what his specific be but i would -- go back and read his book and his plan there 's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cut we raise tax less on the middle class and more on the wealthy but otherwise the plan be remarkably similar so i think it would be -- i 'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps change his position from his book last year and he have some new idea to bring to bear i 'll be glad to hear them q to follow up sir how do you plan to handle his political criticism launch a campaign against you do you think you can sit back and just -- the president well first of all i will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him a you do to me and if change his position from the position he take in the campaign last year then we need to know why and what his idea be maybe get some constructive idea i think the american people have show that very impatient with people who want to produce result and the one thing i think that everybody have figure out about me in the last -- even if they agree with what i do -- be that i want to get something do i just come here to try to change thing i want to do thing and i want to do thing that help people 's life so my judgment be that if he make a suggestion that be good that be constructive that take u beyond some idea propose that will change people 's life for the well fine but i think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the president q mr. president to go back to bosnia for a minute you continue to insist that this have to be multilateral action a criterion that seem to have hamstrung u when it come to many option thus far and make it look a if this be a state of paralysis the united state be the last remain superpower why be it not appropriate in this situation for the united state to act unilaterally the president well the united state -- surely you would agree that the united state even a the last remain superpower have to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the united nation q but you have a mandate and -- the president they do and that be one of the thing that we have under review i rule out any option for action i would remind all of you i have not rule out any option except that we have not discuss and we be not consider the introduction of american force into continue hostility there we be not so we be review other option but i also would remind you that to be fair our ally have have -- the french the british and the canadian -- have have troop on the ground there they have be justifiably worried about those but they have support the airdrop the toughen of the sanction they welcome the american delegation now in europe work on how to make these sanction really work and really bite against serbia and i can tell you that the other nation involve be also genuinely reassess their position and i would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concert action that go beyond where we have be i have any criticism of the british the french and others about that q would that be military action q mr. president several of the lead light in your administration range from your fbi director to your u.n. ambassador to your deputy budget director to your health service secretary have issue statement in the last couple of week which be absolutely contradictory to some of the position take in your administration why be that be you lose your political grip the president give me an example q example judge session say that there be no child abuse in waco madeleine albright have say in this morning 's newspaper at least that she favor air strike in bosnia all of these be thing you say that you support the president first of all i know what -- we know that david koresh have sex with child i think that be undisputed be it not be it not do anybody dispute that where i come from that qualifies a child abuse and we know that he have people teach these kid how to kill themselves i think that qualifies a abuse and not criticize judge session because i know exactly what he say in term of madeleine albright madeleine albright have make no public statement at all about air strike there be a press report that she write me a confidential letter in which she express her -- or memo -- in which she express her view about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior member of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next and i have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next and not go to discus the recommendation they make to me but in the next few day when i make a decision about what to do then i will announce what go to do so i say that either one of those example qualifies speak out of school q how about the value add tax mr. president the president what be that q the value add tax -- mrs. rivlin and miss shalala both say that they thought that that be a good idea the president i mind them say they think a good idea there be all kind of argument for it on policy ground that do not mean that we have decide to incorporate it in the health care debate no decision have be make on that and i have no objection to their express their view on that have a lot of people from business and labor come to u say that they thought that tax would help make their particular industry more competitive in the global economy i take no -- that take a line against an administration policy q mr. president a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representative come out of a meeting with you and express in the most ring term their confidence in your understand of them and their political aspiration and their belief that you would fulfill those aspiration do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhance expectation the president well i know about that and i know what their -- it depends on what the expectation be but i 'll tell you this i believe that this country 's policy should be heavily bias in favor of nondiscrimination i believe when you tell people they do certain thing in this country that other people can do there ought to be an overwhelm and compelling reason for it i believe we need the service of all of our people and i have say that consistently and not a a political proposition the first time this issue come up be in 1991 when i be in boston i be just ask the question about it and i might add -- interest that i have be attack -- obviously those who disagree with me here be primarily come from the political right in america when i be governor i be attack from the other direction for stick up for the right of religious fundamentalist to run their child care center and to practice home school under appropriate safeguard i just have always have an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the right of american individual citizen to live up to the full of their capacity and go to stick right with that q be you concerned sir that you may have generate expectation on their end and criticism among others that have hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue the president yes but i have not place a great deal of emphasis on it gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarter and in the press just simply take my position and try to see it through and what i do it take a lot of my time a president to say what i believe in and what i intend to do and what i 'll continue to do q mr. president get back to the situation in bosnia -- and we understand you make any final decision on new option previously consider unacceptable but the two most commonly heard option would be lift the arm embargo to enable the bosnian muslim to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strike perhaps to cut off supply line without tell u your decision -- presumably you make any final decision on those two option -- what be the pro and con that be go through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision the president reluctant to get into this there be -- those be two of the option there be some other option that have be consider all have plus and minus all have supporter and opponent within the administration and in the congress where i would remind you heavy consultation will be require to embark on any new policy i do believe that on the air strike issue the pronouncement that general powell have make generally about military action apply there if you take action if the united state take action we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met we must be able to understand it and it limitation must be clear the united state be not should not become involve a a partisan in a war with regard to the lift of the arm embargo the question obviously there be if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace will it lead to more bloodshed what kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy but i think both of them deserve some serious consideration along with some other option we have q do you think that these people who be try to get u into war in bosnia be really remember that we take care of hundred of thousand of veteran from the last war and we take care of our prisoner and get them all home from vietnam and now many of them be come up with bill for treatment of agent orange how can we afford to go to any more of these war the president well i think a good argument against the united state itself become involve a a belligerent in a war there but we be after all the world 's only super power we do have to lead the world and there be a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleanse in the former yugoslavia which could have not only enormous far humanitarian consequence -- and goodness know there have be many -- but also could have other practical consequence in other nearby region where the same sort of ethnic tension exist q do you make any kind of agreement with boris yeltsin to hold off either on air strike or any kind of aggressive action against the serb until after sunday and in general how have his political situation affected your deliberation on bosnia the president no i have not make any agreement and he do not ask for that we never even discuss that interestingly enough the russian i would remind you in the middle of president yeltsin 's campaign abstain from our attempt to get tougher sanction through the united nation in what i thought be the proper decision for them and one that the united state and sure the rest of the free world very much appreciate q do you wish mr. president that become more involve in the planning of the waco operation and how would you handle that situation differently now the president i think a a practical matter that the president should become involve in the planning of those kind of thing at that detail one of the thing that sure will come out when we look into this be -- the question will be ask and answer do all of u who up the line of command ask the question we should have ask and get the answer we should have gotten and i look forward to that but at the time i have to say a i do before the first thing i do after the atf agent be kill once we knew that the fbi be go to go in be to ask that the military be consult because of the quasi a least military nature of the conflict give the resource that koresh have in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them and then on the day before the action i ask the question of the attorney general which i have report to you previously and which at the time i thought be sufficient i have -- a i say sure -- i leave it to others to make the suggestion about whether there be other question i should have ask q mr. president what be your assessment of director session role in the waco affair and have you make a decision on his future and if you will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide the president well first of all i have no assessment of his role since i have no direct contact with him and i mean no negative or positive inference i have no assessment there i stand by what i say before about my general high regard for the fbi and wait for a recommendation from the attorney general about what to do with the direction of the fbi q mr. president since you say that one side in bosnia conflict represent inhumanity that the holocaust carry to the nth degree why do you then tell u that the united state can not take a partisan view in this war the president well i say that the principle of ethnic cleanse be something we ought to stand up against that do not mean that the united state or the united nation can enter a war in effect to redraw the line geographical line of republic within what be yugoslavia or that that would ultimately be successful i think what the united state have to do be to try to figure out whether there be some way consistent with force the people to resolve their own difficulty we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleanse and that be obviously the difficulty we be wrestling with this be clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face and that all of our ally face and if it be easy i suppose it would have be solve before we have try to do more in the last 90 day than be previously do it have clearly not be enough to stop the serbian aggression and we be now look at what else we can do q yesterday you specifically criticize the roosevelt administration for not have bombed the railroad to the concentration camp and thing that be near military target there step like that that would not involve conflict -- direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider the president there may be i would remind you that the circumstance be somewhat different we be then at war with germany at the time and what make that whole incident so -- series of incident -- so perplex but we have -- a i say get all of our option under review q the diplomatic initiative on haiti be on the verge of collapse what can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation the president well you may know something i not what our people tell me i think mr. caputo and ambassador pezzullo have do together a good job the thing keep go back and forth because of the people who be involve with the de facto government there obvious what their concern be they be the same concern that lead to the ouster of aristide in the first place and president aristide we feel should be restore to power work toward that i get a report on that -- we discus it at least three time a week and convince that go to prevail there and be successful i do believe that there 's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both side of the ledger while we try to establish the condition of ongoing civilize society but i believe go to prevail there q mr. president would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 day before we make one for you laughter the president well i 'll say if -- i believe first of all we pass the budget resolution in record time that be the big issue that confirm the direction of the administration and confirm the commitment of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do it by specific spending cut and by raise tax almost all of which come from the high income people in this society -- reverse a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burden be borne by the middle class whose income be go down when their tax be go up while the deficit go from 1 trillion to 4 trillion the total national debt and the deficit continued to go up we have a 20-year low in interest rate from mortgage we have low interest rate across the board we have ten of billion of dollar flood back into this economy a people refinance their debt we have establish a new environmental policy which be dramatically different the secretary of education have work with me and with others and with the governor to establish a new approach in education that focus on tough standard a well a increase opportunity we have do an enormous amount of work on political reform on campaign finance and lobbying reform and i have impose tough ethic requirement on my own administration 's official these thing be consistent with not only what i say do in the campaign but with turn the country around the vice president be head a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizen of this country we be work on a whole range of other thing the welfare reform initiative to move people from welfare to work and of course a massive amount of work have be do on the health care issue which be a huge economic and personal security problem for million of american so i think it be amaze how much have be do more will be do we also pass the family leave bill a version of the motor voter bill -- that have not come out of conference back to me yet and everything have be pass except the stimulus program so i think do fine and move in the right direction i feel good about it q sir a follow-up you say though that one of your big initiative aid to soviet russia be now practically finish -- if we pas a stimulus bill in our own country how can we do it for them the president let me recast the question a little bit a good question -- laughter -- a good question but to be fair get to recast it we have already -- the first round of aid to the soviet -- to non-soviet russia to a democratic russia be plainly go to go through the first 1.6 billion the aid that we agree with our partner in the g-7 to provide through the international financial institution which be a big dollar item be plainly go to go through the question be can we get any more aid for russia that require a new appropriation by the united state congress and that be a question i think mary that will be resolve in the week ahead in part by what happens to the american worker and their job and their future i think the two thing will be tie by many member of congress q the tailhook report come out this morning document horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the navy how much do you discus the incident and what might be do about it with your nominee to be the secretary of the navy the president first let me comment a little on that the inspector general 's report detail conduct which be wrong and which have no place in the arm service and i expect the report to be act on in the appropriate way i also want to say to the american people and to all of you that the report should be take for what it be a very disturb list of allegation which will have to be thoroughly examine it should not be take a a general indictment of the united state navy or of all the fine people who serve there it be very specific in it allegation and it will be pursue the only thing i say to the secretary-designate of the navy and the only thing i should have say to him i think be that i expect him to take the report and to do his duty and i believe he will do that q mr. president to back to russia for just a minute the late poll show that mr. yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence but there seem to be a real toss-up on whether or not voter be go to endorse his economic reform the president i understand that q can you live with a split -- laughter -- can you live with a split decision though or do you need both pass in order to then build support for russian aid the president i believe -- the answer to your question be for the united state the key question should be that which be pose to any democracy which be who win the election if he win the election if he be ratify by the russian people to continue a their president then i think we should do our best to work with him toward reform you know we have a lot of other country here for the holocaust museum dedication -- their leader be here leader from eastern europe leader from at least one republic of the former soviet union all of them have terrible economic challenge a they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there 's economic slowdown everywhere and in a world in which there 's economic slowdown and difficulty all leader will have trouble have their policy be popular in a poll because they produce the result that the people so earnestly yearn for you can understand that but if they have confidence in the leadership i think all we can ask and the united state will -- if the russian people ratify him a their president and stick with him then the united state will continue to work with him i think he be a genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely commit to reform i think that we should support that q mr. president mr. perot have come out strongly in what be perceive behind the line against a free trade agreement -- nafta how hard be you go to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplish the president i think have the agreement ready in the fairly near future you know our people be still work with the mexican government and with the canadian on the side agreement try to work out what the environmental agreement will say what the labor agreement will say and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement be the mexican say and there be some merit to their position that worried about transfer their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission even in the united state to be fair we have some folk who be worried about that -- about give that up on the other hand if go to have an environmental agreement and a labor standard agreement that mean something then there have to be ultimately some consequence for violate them so what try to do be to agree on an approach which would say that if there be a pattern of violation -- if you keep on violate it past a certain point -- maybe not an isolated incident but a pattern of violation -- there be go to be some enforcement there must be consequence and work out the detail of that but i still feel quite good about it and this be just an area where i disagree with mr. perot and with others i think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the mexican economy and the american economy and lead u from there to chile to other market economy in latin america and give u a big world in which to trade i think the only way a rich country can grow richer if you look at what japan and other country in the pacific be do to reach out in their own region a pretty good lesson to u that we have well worry about how to build those bridge in our own area so this be an idea battle you know get a lot of question and i want to answer them all but let me say not every one of these thing can be distil simply into politics -- you know who 's for this and who 's for that and if this person be for this somebody else have get to be for that a lot of these thing honestly involve real debate over idea over who 's right and wrong about the world toward which move and the answer be not self-evident and one of the reason that i want to run for president be i want to sort of open the floodgate for debate these idea so that we could try to change in the appropriate way so i just have a difference of opinion i believe that the concept of nafta be sound even though a you know i thought that the detail need to be improve q mr. president there be a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the russian document that purport to show that the vietnamese have held back american prisoner general vessey have now say publicly that while the document itself be authentic he believe that it be incorrect do you have a personal view at this point about that issue and more broadly do you believe that in fact the vietnamese do return all the american prisoner at the time of the paris peace accord the president first let me say i saw general vessey before he go to vietnam and after he return and i have a high regard for him and i appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way a to whether the document have any basis in fact let me say that the government of vietnam be more forthcoming than it have be in the past and give u some document that would tend to undermine the validity of the russian document claim i do not know whether that be right or wrong we be have it basically evaluate at this time and when we complete the evaluation tell you and of course we want to tell the family of those who be miss in action or who be pow i think that be able to make some progress in eliminate some of the question about the outstanding case a a result of this last interchange but i can not say that fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know there be still some case that we know the answer to but i do believe make some progress i be encourage by the last trip q like to follow up on that before the u.s. normalizes relation allows trade to go forward do you have to be personally sure that every case have be resolve or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take year to resolve these case the vietnamese have make sufficient offering to u to confirm good faith the president a lot of expert say you can never resolve every case every one that we resolve all the case for them and that there be still some case that have not be factually resolve go back to the second world war but what i would have to be convince of be that we have go a long way toward resolve every case that could be resolve at this moment in time and that there be a complete open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be do always to keep resolve those case and not there yet again i have to be guide a little bit by people who know a lot about this and i confess to be much more heavily influence by the family of the people whose life be lose there or whose life remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other thing which seem so compelling in this moment i just be very influence by how the family feel q your economic stimulus package be you do some kind of reality check now and scale back some of your plan your legislative plan for the come year include the crime bill the health care initiative and other thing be there any plan to do that and also do you underestimate the power of senator bob dole the president no what i underestimated be the extent to which what i thought be a fairly self-evident case particularly after we stayed below the spending cap approve by this congress include the republican who be in this congress last year -- when we have already pass a budget resolution which call for over 500 billion in deficit reduction when they have vote repeatedly for supplemental appropriation to help foreign government i thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture and i underestimated that i do not have an adequate strategy of deal with that i also thought that if i make a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise that it would not be rebuffed instead every time i offer something they reduce the offer that they have previously be talk to the majority leader about so it be a strange set of event but i think what happen be what be a significant part of our plan but not the major part of it acquire a political connotation that get out of proportion to the merit so that a lot of republican be say to me privately `` mr. president like to be for this but i now and all strung out and divide '' and i think we need to do a reality check a i say what i want to know -- let me go back to what i say -- what i want to know from our folk and from our friend in the senate on -- and republican or democrat -- be what could i have do differently to make it come out differently because the real loser here be not the president and the administration the real loser be the hundred of thousand of people who have job now we could have put another 700,000 kid to work this summer i mean we could have do a lot of good thing with that money and i think that be very very sad and it become more political than it should have but the underlie rationale i think hold a lot of water -- that it be deficit spending that just wash. q and redo -- the president no i mean you know for example -- you mention the crime bill i think it would be a real mistake not to pas the crime bill i mean the crime bill be almost on the point of passage last year and they be all fight over the brady bill surely surely after what we have be through in this country just in the last three month with the kind of mindless violence we have see we can pas a bill require people to go through a wait period before they buy a handgun and surely we can see that we need more police officer on the street another thing that -- i really believe that once we move some of that money -- not all but some of it up into this job package to make some of the job rehiring police officer on the street who 'd be laid off that would be a compelling case i mean people be scar in this country and i think we need to go forward i feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill q mr. president back to the tailhook report for a second that report contain very strong criticism of the navy 's senior leadership in general but do not name any of the senior officer do you believe that the senior officer who be implicate in this include admiral kelso who be there one night in la vega should they be discipline and do you believe the public have a right to know the name of the senior officer the president you should know that under the rule of law which apply to this i be in the chain of command there be now an inspector general 's report and the law must take it course if i be to answer that question i might prejudice any decision which might be later make in this case i really think -- i think all i can tell you be what i have already say i be very disturbed by the specific allegation in the inspector general 's report and i want appropriate action to be take until the proper procedure have a chance to kick in and appropriate action be take i have be advise that because i be the commander-in-chief i have to be very careful about what i say so a not to prejudice the right of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con so i say any more except to say that i want this thing handle in an appropriate and thorough way q mr. president could i ask you for a clarification on bosnia you say that you be not consider introduction of american force do that include any air force a well a ground force sir the president i say ground force q you say ground force could i ask you sir if you fear that use u.s. air strike might draw the united state into a ground war there the president i just want to discus our evaluation of the option anymore told you that there 's never be a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground force into an ongoing conflict there q with hundred of thousand of gay in washington this weekend for the march do you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend do you ever consider in any way participate in some of the activity the president no q why not the president because i -- and basically i participate in other march i think once you become president on balance except under unusual circumstance that be not what should be do but more importantly go to the american society of newspaper editor a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make to try to focus anew on what i think be the fundamental issue at stake for our country right now and i expect that i will say something about the fact that a lot of american have come here ask for a climate that be free of discrimination ask basically to be able to work hard and live by the rule and be treat like other american citizen if they do that and just that and always be my position -- not only for the gay who will be here but for others a well thank you very much"
