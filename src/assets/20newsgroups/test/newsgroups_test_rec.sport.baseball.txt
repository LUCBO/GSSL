b"the problem with your nihilistic approach roger be that it take all the sense out of the game by your line of reason if a guy hit into a double play with one out and the base load there 's no point in say that that be a bad thing to do if his team won anyway or speculate on what might have happen if thing have go otherwise so the double play be merely an event that happen in the course of a game that be eventually won or lose for unknown reason after all any speculation involves construct a fantasy about what would have happen but do n't roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead or be you willing to consider empirical evidence team go to the post-season when they win more game than anybody else in their division if they do n't make the post-season they do n't win the series will you agree that win a division be a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting if so you must agree that win game be a useful intermediate goal towards win the division and our disagreement come when we consider how to win game in your viewpoint a express win game happens for reason that can not be analyze while many of u be think thing like `` base- runner be good out be bad and therefore walk be well than double play with the base load '' you be think thing like '' it 's a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamic that will cause the team to win today '' the result be that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual player perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me play left field after all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have help the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it therefore i could be an extremely valuable player do dave winfield have anything to do with the jay victory probably but how do you know if you replace him with andres galarraga perhaps the jay would have won perhaps they would have lose perhaps they would have defect to alpha centauri bearing in mind that the fly saucer would not have land in mid-season have winfield be dhing for toronto be babe ruth a good player he played on some ws-winning team but do he have anything to do with their success it be generally accepted that ernie bank be a good baseball player and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder be n't it seem to me that anybody who would deny this need to provide the proof now we have observe thing about baseball over the year both empirically and by look at the rulebook it be necessary to score more run than one 's opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score run and to prevent one 's opponent from score run be score while a team be batting and an inning end after the third out so it would seem that make out be bad while hit home run be good player have tendency to hit or pitch at certain level and these be usually somewhat consistent from year to year we do use these statistic to predict winner and so do you to make some flat prediction barry bond will have a high obp+slg than gene larkin this year the brave will finish ahead of the rockies in the standing the tiger will score more run than the royal but will also give up more i would be astonish if any of these turn out to be false and i suspect so would you a a matter of fact i be pretty sure i can predict all the division winner this year give 3-4 guess per division and this be certainly well than random chance and almost statistically significant if you will admit that the rockies and mariner be unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there be some sort of way to measure likelihood however fuzzy so how about `` real life '' person a robs a service station with two people in it use a .38 automatic pistol get 42 and be convict and sentence for three year person b with a similar criminal record robs a service station with two people in it use a .38 revolver get 42 and be convict since they use two different type of handgun be comparison totally meaningless say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still work my cat be always test this they do n't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time you have never drop a pencil at that exact time of the century before so all previous evidence be meaningless or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hit the desk"

b"i remember a post from last year indicate that a `` pitch clock '' be try in one of the minor league some time back and do not work i do n't remember why they say that it do not work anyone remember this jody mcdonnel on wip in phil have be say that a pitch clock be inevitable how would a pitch clock work on throw to first another pair of suggestion 1. remove the balk rule it be the runner responsibility to stay `` safe '' no matter what the pitcher do 2. if a pitcher throw to an occupy base more than x time x 3 to 5 without successfully pick off the runner the runner advance a base a if walk the no-balk seem to give the pitcher the advantage the base-walk allows the runner to `` challenge '' pitcher to throw over to the base i too find myself surf when i know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his `` jewlery ''"
b"well when you say without morris you have to mention an assume replacement if the alternative to morris be let cito gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 day then of course the blue jay would n't have won without morris if the alternative be replacement level then i think it would 've be very close and yes morris might 've make the difference if the alternative be frank viola the blue jay probably would have won more easily with viola yes you can make the argument that the his presence prevent the team from collapse in august those inning be probably helpful well i think be complete b what happen most of the time be that morris fell behind and the team come back and rescue him mostly this be because he 's a lousy 1st inning pitcher and much well the rest of the way that the team can climb out of 4-0 5-0 hole consistently and win them 6-5 be not to morris credit it 's to the team 's credit furthermore while morris do exceed the w-l percentage that would be project from his run allow and run support he have n't do this in previous year in fact his w-l record in 1991 be a lot bad than what it project to be with run support and run allow do you think he just come up with this ability in 1992. look at the 2 postseason game he pitch decently in typical morris game morris get behind team rescue him he 's not responsible for that rescue and in both those game the team just do n't rescue him enough jack morris pitch a well a he do during much of the season in those 2 game the offense just didn't earn him a victory morris be one of those guy who will reture when he ca n't start anymore he 's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen"

b"yes everyone seem to be in agreement that the yankee be finally move in the right direction they should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in august however i would take back a few move 1. the jim abbott trade i think abbott be not only an inspirational person but a great pitcher also he could win the cy young this year but he wo n't because the right side of the yank infield be n't good enough so why be this not a good trade jt snow how many rookie have be able to step in and immediately have the impact that he have have so far on the angel i know it 's early but if you 've see this kid hit field or talk you can just tell that he be go to be a tremendous player the yank should have kept him what about mattingly you ask well it 's great that the yank have take care of him and remain loyal but he 's 10 year old than snow and just do n't have the same bat speed a before his back injury it 's a shame but a a yankee fan who want to see the *best* yankee team i 'd take snow over mattingly at first the yank also give up two promising propects with snow for abbott besides with domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling hitchcock they be just load with propects i know abbotts only 26 but this be too much to give up i believe george force this trade because he believe and he 's right that abbott will be a big hit in ny however i 'd like to see the yankee build a baseball team not an amusement show 2. wade boggs i live in boston and like wade a lot but his career be wind down and i would rather see the yank start to develop a long term solution i.e hensley muelins rus davis velarde besides wade just do n't have any range what a shame about charlie hayes huh 3. spike owen see wade boggs i 'd much rather see them develop dave silvestri or whoever wade and spike next to each other in the infield be go to raise the yankee staff era 1/2 point and these guy be on the down side of their career 4. danny tartabull yes he 's put up some tremendous number and it 's nice to think about what he could do if he be ever healthy all year but he never be we should expect 120 game max out of him meanwhile gerald williams be play at columbus and paul o'neil be play left field i believe o'neil lead nl outfielder in assist last year and tartabull be a poor defensive outfielder what i 'm basically get at be the yank be move in the right direction but be not ready to win a pennent this year they should at the gm level be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series this mean get the young player experience in the major now so they will be ready in a year or two i 'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner certainly the boggs deal be all george it look like george be planning the right mix of veteran and young player to win a world series now the veteran be always available and can be add at any time like boston do this year develop the young player first then add the one or two veteran or in the yankee case just keep them let 's all u yankee fan hope that george do n't dismantle the terrific job stick and company have do building the yankee organization back into one of respect i 'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it take to patch hole today relief pitch for example george must realize that the yankee rebuild process be still one or two year away have patience george and we will all enjoy the future fire bucky and trade the kid and it 's baseball hell for all loyal yankee fan for a long time"

b"take a look at the standing it 's real easy to get so focus on minutinae and forget that the giant happen to be in first place if it's work you do n't screw it up by change thing just because you think it ought to be different some folk like to argue about theoretical detail i prefer to watch team win when the giant slip to third then we can talk about how to re-arrange the batting order until then i think it 's stupid to focus on what 's wrong for the simple fact that it 's work a it be in the major i do n't follow al so i wo n't comment on `` major '' in the nl if i have my choice of any 1b in the league for my team it 'd be clark and i 'd hit him third my fantasy team have both grace and murray on it because i 've never be able to get clark i 'd take any of the three without hesitation in real life but i think clark be it williams not even close i much prefer his defense but when he isn't headcasing it matt have a good solid swing and some real punch if he drop to .230 then he wanders out of cleanup but accord to the late baseball weekly he 's hit .275 and in the last week hit .296. that 's not exactly chopped liver mostly though the giant be win and frankly a long a that continue it 's rather silly to second-guess their strategy but evidently some folk would rather be right than be first"
b"cardinal for poor without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war i would like to question the notion that `` sit a rest player down '' have any real effect on his long-term performance sure if a man be tire and need real rest then take a break might be a constructive act perhaps if a man be mentally `` strain '' then sit him down might help to the extent that that help him relax but i would like to suggest that in the long run player do slump and benching be probably irrelevant"
b"some deletion well we agree on the last part one of the basic thing you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player 's performance on it in the future be for there to be a correlation from year to year a player 's batting average be correlate fairly well from year to year a player 's ability to walk or infielder 's defensive average be correlate well that be to say give their past performance in those statistic we can have a pretty good handle on how they 'll do next year put in some simple information about age and you can do even well one of the basic problem with something like `` clutch '' batting average overall batting average be that the correlation from year to year be almost zero add to the sample size do n't seem to help much a a counterexample to what you show consider the follow two player from 1984-1987 non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 if you have have these two player in 1988 by your logic in those `` clutch '' situation you 'd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye well in 1988 maldonado hit .267 in `` non-clutch '' and .190 in `` clutch '' while lemon hit .254 in `` non-clutch '' and .313 in `` clutch '' before you accuse me of completely cooking the data there be 96 player who have 25+ `` clutch '' at bat every year from 1984-1988 accord to elia a a simple measure of clutchness let 's just look at clutch ba-non-clutch ba if you use '84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 player you 'd find that 27 of the 96 be below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88 26 be above league average in both period and the other 43 be above in one and below in the other if you be just flip coin you 'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switch the difference between the observe result and the coin flip experiment be not statisically significant btw correlate player _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with '88 give a correlation coefficient of 0.59 which be significant at something well than the 99.9 confidence level correlate their clutch-non-clutch ba for the same period give a correlation of 0.088 significant at no level of any interest actually it 's technically incorrect to say that we ca n't predict future clutch performance it 's more correct to say that we ca n't predict future clutch performance with any skill harold"

b"right most definitely this may be the root of the confusion ... please consider the follow hypothetical with an open mind note that i be *not* yet say that it have anything to do with the question at hand suppose we have a simplify lotto game you pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number be drawn suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week in the first year of the game approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more time in the second year of the game 1/4 of those 7-time winner will again be 7-time winner in the third year of the game 1/4 of those who won 7 or more time in each of the first two year will win 7 again suppose i start with 1024 people in my population after three year i have 32 people who have consistently in each of the last three year won 140 or more the number of time expect do we expect them to be big winner in the fourth year of the game no because we know there be no skill involve nothing about these '' consistent winner '' can influence their chance of win but suppose we *don't* know whether or not there be a chance that skill might be involve perhaps some of the people in our population be psychic or something how would we test this hypothesis we can look for correlation in the population now most of the population will show zero correlation but our psychic should show a high positive correlation even if they be n't very good psychic they should still manage to win 7 or more time most year net result a small positive correlation over the entire population well zero correlation be zero correlation you mention that sabo have hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3 year but if we look at the past we find that clutch pattern be just a likely to reverse a they be to remain consistent the length of the streak doesn't seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year be there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streak now if it be true that `` 75 of all three-year streak remain true to form '' then we might have something useful but then we wouldn't have zero correlation instead we have `` 50 of all three-year streak remain true to form and 50 of all three-year streak reverse '' you look at those number and say `` three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year '' but it would be equally valid to look at those number and say `` three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year '' since the probability be split 50-50 each way then we would have something useful and we would also have a positive correlation but for every individual that exhibit such a pattern and hold true there be another who exhibit such a pattern and then revers"

b"i like the clark-williams-bonds order pitcher can only walk clark with 2 out unlike last year williams be get well pitch to hit with bond loom in the on-deck circle since matt have a terrible batting eye this help the giant a lot when bond get on base all by himself he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by thompson manwaring or clayton if you bat bond before the other slugger then you do n't want him to run because a `` caught steal '' could take you out of a big inning also bond be less in need of protection behind him because he be such a good base stealer a walk be a potential double the only draw back be when clark and williams be clog up the base infront of bond ... and i think that 's a problem the giant will be glad to see especially if robby thompson get hot"

b"i do n't understand this at all matt williams have demonstrate throughout his career that he will not wait for good pitch to hit he wo n't take walk he 'd rather swing if i 'm the oppose pitcher why would i groove a fastball to williams and have him hit it well when i know that williams will swing and miss or at least not hit very well at a low and away curve"
b"2 simple reason 1 batting williams ahead of bond will create a left clark right williams left bond situation in the middle of the batting order this make it tougher for oppose manager to change pitcher 2 have bond batting behind williams mean that matt will get more good pitch to hit this be important since he struggle so much with break ball oppose pitcher do n't want to walk williams to get to bond"
b'just to add to this vein consider that range of a first baseman be not the only important thing he be imo the best fielder of bad throw from the other infielder i have see him scoop ball out of the dirt catch ball off a large bounce take down ball over his head wide etc ad infinitum *and* he get the out much of the time some of the thing he do to save his infielder of error be amaze you have to give mattingly credit for be able to do all of that while keep his foot near the bag yes i be sure he get a few call because he be mattingly'

b"i wholeheartedly endorse it i have no problem with the have n't be to many a 's game have you seriously i do n't mind a baseball game that last a long time if it last a long time because there be good baseball be played however i don't like 3-2 game that take 3+ hour because there 's a lot of dead time go on in that game i do n't find anything excite about watch batter or pitcher wander around between pitch or watch the catcher make a slow walk to the mound or watch lot of pitcher change for no good reason whitey herzog use to be the master of this the game could be way out of reach and he 'd still be make switch for platoon advantage i want to see the game not people stand around i do n't really enjoy watch nfl football game in person for example because there 's so much dead time you do n't really notice how much dead time there be if you watch it on television because they 're busy show you replay i do n't like that college basketball game have so many time out at the end of the game the ncaa have make some move to try to alleviate this problem for next year they 're go to stop the clock after make basket late in game next year and they 're go to a 35 second clock there 's also a difference in how tolerant i be of long game if i'm watch them on the tube and if i 'm go there in person for me go to an a 's game have become a major commitment of time one that i 'm not willing to make that often the length of their game be cost the a's revenue from me"

b"hi there i 'm german and i have be into this mlb stuff since almost one year now there be many problem occur for me one of them be the era statistic for pitcher what do it say era indicates the average number of earn run attribute to a pitcher per nine inning game thus if a pitcher pitch 3 inning and give up 1 earn run his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earn run thus his era be 3.00. to compute the era you simply take the number of earn run divide by the inning pitch and then multiple the result by 9. era er/ip 9 an earn run be run that be give up by the pitcher that be not attribute to a fielding error more specifically if an error occurs that represent the third out all run score after the error be consider unearned run earn run be also run score a a result of player who be left on base when the pitcher exit the game here be some example if there be two out in an inning and there be men on base if an error occurs that represent the third out all of the run after this error and not count a earn run if a pitcher issue some base on ball walk and leaf the game before the inning be complete he be responsible for the people who be left on base if the those runner who be left on base score and the score be not a result of an error those eraned run be attribute to the pitcher who left the game i hope this explains thing for you"
b"this come up periodically and i just do n't get it take for example mark mcgwire he walk 90 time in 1993. if that 's not a potential great example of what you 're talk about then i do n't know what be now let 's look at what happens when mcgwire do n't walk 75 of the time he make an out 10 of the time he hit a single 5 of the time he hit a double 10 of the time he hit a homer now you 're pitch against mcgwire would you trade 20 walk for 2 homer 1 double 2 single and 15 out i would why give him the base when you can get him out 3 time out of 4 then there be guy like alex cole who have a career .363 obp even though he 's never have a batting average over .300 he do hit .300 in 227 ab in 1990 or hit a single home run yep that 's right he's *never* hit a homer in 916 ab 's through the end of 1992. who 'd be afraid to throw a strike to him mike jones aix high-end development mjones donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com"

b"i wonder why you say that i do n't see why have a spouse and/or kid would have anything to do with it it might if you brought your kid to the game and want them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour in which case i 'd probably decide to take my kid to game on weekend a many people do or else be prepared to leave the game early but from what you say later on you do n't bring your kid *or* your spouse to the game a it happens i have a husband but no kid and my husband usually attends game with me i can see it 's a problem if you do n't bring your wife to the ballgame but that 's a problem even if the game go a trim 2 1/2 hour a far a bagging work the next day i do n't really understand why that's necessary unless go to a game also mean that you consume vast quantity of beer i note that this be the case for many guy if you do n't think you can get up to go to work after a long even out then do n't have long evening out during the week look if i pay between 8.00 and 20.00 apiece for ticket plus 10.00 for parking plus spending my time and energy drive to and from boston plus spending additional money on concession etc at the ballpark then i see go to a game a a considerable investment of time and money i ca n't afford to go to a lot of game hence go to a game be a big deal like go to a play or an opera maybe you have more money than i do and can go to game all year long so it 's not such a big deal for you but i 'm not interested in have game `` speed up '' any more than i want to have _die walkure_ cut down to a convenient `` weeknight version '' of two hour if i felt that go to a night game during the week would interfere with my family life or my work life then i 'd choose to go to a weekend game impo"
b"cool and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly name-calling of others one of the basic thing you need to ok. actually i think the large-scale sample size be part of the problem it seem to me that if we be to plot all the player in baseball in regard to ba vs. clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve the x-axis be the +/- deviation in clutch hit vs. non-clutch the y-axis be the number of player certainly there would be *some* player on the extreme end of the bell my *supposition* be that if we be to find the same player consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusion about *those* player a oppose to all baseball player a a counterexample to you wo n't hear those kind of accusation from me it be interest that you select maldonado because he be someone whom i have also look at he have be a very inconsistent hitter in term of ba hit in 1989 92 .217 .273 .250 .272 admittedly he have be trade between league a well a club his clutch hit record be equally inconsistent so for my purpose in 1993 i would not draw any conclusion about his ability to hit in the clutch base on his prior performance i do n't know how i would have felt in 1988 but you may indeed be right when i look at sabo i found a more consistent record of hit and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hit be proportionately below his non-clutch ba ditto for joe carter this probably brings u to the heart of the disagreement i be have with others on this topic must any conclusion base on statistical history be able to be apply broadly throughout a data base before it have any validity be it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to select component of the data base i completely accept that reason again what if we be to find the same individual at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis amen -- the beastmaster"

b"^^^^^^^ ^^^^ please pardon my ignorance if this be well know but what be the current rule maybe we could limit the number of throw to first that the pitcher can make and award a balk if he exceeds it i 'd have another question who would operate the pitch clock one of the umpire add another one to the crew i 'm not sure i like this idea i think it would severely diminish the number of steal base and limit the availability of such neat strategic ploy a the hit and run and the squeeze play one of my personal favorite ahhh i suppose i should read the whole article before i hit the f key eh obviously from what i write above i like this idea it may also increase the number of wild throw to the bag since the pitcher know he do n't have very many chance to pick off the runner so he may hurry too much i 'd rather see run score a the result of sound hit and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule so i suppose there be some disadvantage to that idea too i remember in little league if when up to bat we step out of the batter's box even for a moment we be automatically out that may be a little harsh for the major but seriously how about put a limit on the batter be able to step out take several dozen practice swing pound their shoe scratch their ball etc. maybe force them to stay in the batter 's box would n't be such a bad idea that could save a few minute"

either `` organ '' or `` gene '' might seem reasonable choice depend on what point we be try to make a `` gene '' interpretation actually might be really interest in this case but that would be a different and probably longer post if however we take the `` organ '' view then our knowledge of biology should make u pause before we start say thing like `` specie x be more fit than specie y because of a well organ z '' give what we know about the interdependence of organ we would often be suspicious of such claim but note that this type of argument be quite often make when you map `` specie x '' onto 'humans and `` organ z '' onto 'brain on the other hand some statement of this kind do seem more reasonable than others a far a we can test them e.g 'brain' above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas assume no gross pathology particularly if specie y be a primate even when you make such statement you should be concerned with the function of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one specie and a second organ in another not to mention the possibility that no organ be particularly crucial in some third specie however if we be non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism be not some completely magical unanalyzable `` whole '' but an intrigue process make up of various subprocesses that interact in way that be potentially observable some of these process might be localize to particular organ while others may be distribute across multiple organ in a way this be just like a baseball team except that i think it be pretty clear that the process and interaction involve in baseball be *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organism one thing that be quite difficult about baseball be that perfectly control experiment be sometimes very tough to do but of course this have never stop researcher from do the best they can and sometimes derive very powerful conclusion even in the absence of certainty most of this go far beyond sheer speculation but even sheer speculation can motivate far interest research in this case we 're see the word `` statistic '' mean `` summary of observe event '' where the event themselves can be view a the output of some process and possibly input for other process thus if we have any valid notion of how the process be put together into the function organism data in the form of statistic might give u a basis to test particular hypothesis this statement brings u back to the concept of fitness again fitness be define in term of both an organism and it environment you might be fit in one situation and not another move to baseball it be clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment include all the other team in the league in at least a nominal sense the division winner be the fit team in the league in that they on average have well fitness score than any of their compete opponennts but in a real sense there be a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that be difficult if not impossible to account for in term of factor intrinsic to or interest for baseball the same be true in biology but here be also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal in the world series the random component may be greatly magnify by the small number of game that be played and both team suddenly experience huge change from the environement where they be originally successful it might be fun to watch but it 's unclear what it all really mean *** now just one more un-related point on the other hand you have see some of u who can predict the outcome of the divisional race well than a random assignment of team to finish and maybe some of u e.g me who can do this well than the other participant in this forum on a regular basis but this be probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule give you a little hope that bad hop be n't the only difference between the winner and the loser moreover you 've have the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that make the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the w winner with reliably great accuracy than a coin bias only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on win percentage since stats be summary of event it 's true that if you know the event you can derive the stats but if somebody be try to understand the process behind the stats then the stats produce new knowledge and some of this might even be reliable repeatable and useful speak of which i should get back to produce knowledge in a different field that be of course if i can produce knowledge even though i 'm rely on stats to do it"

b"so what be your definition of `` interfere with the fielder take the throw '' the rule book certainly do n't have a definiton or clarification so it's possible to interpret the rule a say that if the catcher have to alter his throw to avoid hit the batter-runner then again we have interference you know it seem that there be no way to apply this rule justly -- if the catcher or the pitcher say rob dibble for example throw toward first and hit the runner run inside the baseline the fielder take the chance of be eject therefore he probably would throw around the runner or your scenario above him you should note that in our american legion league which us mlb rule we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there be interference per rule 7.09"

b"sigh here we go again must i if i be to say that batting average be a predictor that can be use to judge which of two hitter be more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance be that only valid if i can define the skill in hit a baseball that 's all i 've say except i use the small sample of batting average in clutch situation i do not say i could predict the future i 've suggest that the statistic be not necessarily meaningless here 's the data for this situation non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo 1539 452 .294 259 59 .228 samuel 1564 383 .245 278 83 .299 if you be to have be the red manager at that time i assume you would have have some basis for let sabo hit rather than pinch- hit samuel i 'm sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance you just would n't have use this particular aspect of prior performance be this not correct one more time i do *not* claim to be able to predict the future i say that i accept the above data a an indication that samuel would have have a well chance for success in that situation than sabo and i be not dismiss your work i 'm state my opinion you be say that your work render any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion be some kind of insult to your work i do not say that clutch-hitting be well define i say that the data be significant to me i do not say that it be a consistent skill i have say that it be an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstance and big sigh i have not not not not not not not ever call you or anyone else on r.s.b `` stupid '' it be nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceive bias ah i knew we could get to the name call and there 's that word you like so much wait a minute i thought i first have to define clutch hit do i or do n't i i make two statement in my post 1. i be not convince of your conclusion regard clutch hit 2. i would have hit for sabo a for 2 many of u make a number of write statement through this medium about what we think will happen in baseball i 'm not shy about it i 'll make the statement again i believe that by season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situation will be significantly low than his batting average in non-clutch situation i ca n't prove that it will happen so i guess we 'll just have to wait and see here 's another one for you in 1989 1991 joe carter 's batting average in clutch situation be significantly below his batting average in non-clutch situation each year i presume you think this be random non-clutch 1585 ab 411 h .259 clutch 338 ab 68 h .201 so what could we expect in 1992 from mr. carter well his composite ba through 1989 be .268 through 1990 be .262 through 1991 be .263 so i think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce in 1992 he hit .264. not surprising huh also in 1992 non-clutch 536 ab 144 h .269 clutch 86 ab 20 h .233 no this do n't prove any overall statistical trend that can be use to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayer it just make me think that in 1993 joe carter 's batting average in the clutch be not go to be a high a his ba in non-clutch situation a for 1 above i have plenty of company john dewan of stats inc be the editor of the scout report wherein the statistic regard clutch hit be compile report and reference in the text bill james make numerous reference to a player 's ability to hit well in the clutch i be not say that i can predict the future any more than they be you and others be say that your work render their statement and mine meaningless i do n't accept that which in your word prof that i be a `` total idiot '' `` stupid '' `` total idiot '' my my such hostility -- the beastmaster"

b"a `` reasonable '' umpire would have recognize that ron gant be disturbed with the call a `` reasonable '' umpire would have realize that there be a 1-run game in progress with two out in the ninth what ron gant do be try to regain his composure what a `` normal '' baseball player would have do would have be to get into a heat argument with the umpire and since you ca n't argue ball and strike he would have be eject from the game ron gant by try to avoid such a conflict be penalize for show some restraint incidentally a `` reasonable '' home plate umpire would not have be so resistant to seek the appeal to the first base umpire a gant request if the home plate umpire have appeal to first the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike and gant would not have be so upset if the call have be a ball and the catcher have request the appeal it be likely the home plate umpire would have ask for the help finally the entire game be pretty much a mockery of the so-called effort to `` speed up the game '' the game be played very quickly it be just at 2 hour when the stuff happen in the ninth and the only delay in the entire game have be *the result* of action by the umpire other than deion have to clean garbage off the field"

b"i really do n't want to get into a didso-didnot debate with you but this be somewhat at the heart of our disagreement i do not say nor do i imply that i could predict the future you have infer that my comment meant this and you have base your rebuttal of my comment on the fact that statistical study have demonstrate that there be no reasonable basis for predict future performance in regard to clutch hit sabo 1539 452 .294 259 59 .228 samuel 1564 383 .245 278 83 .299 that be *your* opinion that sabo be `` clearly a well hitter '' than samuel the above data be for a 4-year period end last season last season samuel bat .272 while sabo hit .244 not park adjust this season they be both hit below .200 albeit sabo with more at bat i will agree that over his career sabo have be a well hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel have be a well hitter in certain situation than sabo i do not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit i express my opinion that have i be the red manager or even a red fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situation than sabo ah `` properly '' yes i see please help me what exactly be `` everything else '' that point to sabo i must say i be not aware of the publication can you email me the information regard it availability and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have do extensive study on say supply side economics i do n't mean to insult you but i never do believe you be on the right path i 'm sorry for my contrary opinion/position i also regret that i do n't have the ability to prove that you be wrong but you be it be what it say it be the `` second '' be *your* statement not mine well actually i have n't yet but i 'm not finish look that be i have n't yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situation for the year 1989 91 and then reverse that relationship in 1992. nope sorry but if you be interested in a reason why i expect chris sabo 's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could if you be interested in a reason why i expect joe carter 's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could but you're not interested in that because you think that those conclusion could only be valid if they could be extrapolate over the entire baseball population and they ca n't be the problem here be that i *do* believe you i accept your work i believe that try to predict future clutch performance base on prior clutch history be meaningless no well than a coin toss i actually *do* accept your work a it happens i also have an *opinion* that in certain situation for certain player a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in project future player performance for that player and chris sabo be one such player well since i defer to your statistical wisdom i think i must have an open mind now we have to pose the same question to you -- the beastmaster"
b"stuff delete i agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific argument that `` have great hand '' mean nothing it seem to me that a first-baseman 's defensive value be not entirely or even primarily from his ability to field grounder or catch popups how many such chance do he get during a game many few than he get chance to catch throw from 2b ss,3b and p i mean the total of these be much high than grounder/popup total this implies to me that there be value in catch these throw well even if they be high up-the-line or in the dirt `` good hand '' be need for such play and thus have value i do n't have any number for the relative number of occurences of these play but i 'd guess that the value of these ability be similar it 's just like you do n't judge catcher 's defense primarily on how they field bunt and popups but not a marked i suppose"

b'-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a far a i know a save opportunity be when it be 7th inning or beyond and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game for example if it be the bottom of the 8th inning and clemens be pithching the red sox be lead 4-1 and clemens have just givin up a hit so there be a man on first the batter and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer if jeff russel come in the red sox reliever and finish the game without allow the tie or lose run to score he would get the save and clemens would get the win thats how i beleive it work'

b"be you kid i 'm stuck with the toronto skydome where their idea of a 7th inning stretch be that `` blue jay '' song where everyone get to yell `` okay okay blue jay blue jay let 's play ball '' wow.. what genius do it take to compose that one to outshine the old classic and there be woman on the field to `` lead the crowd ''"
b"dj be a popular player in san diego derek bell be not fare well in the clubhouse at toronto so no matter how bad he look now i still think it be a steal for the jay just from the perspective of team chemistry no statistic can describe it sorry statheads and since there be so many new face in the clubhouse i think the jay be still try to find it insert the same comment into the jack morris v. clemens w ring string yet at first i be sad to see derek go still anticipate all of the talent they rave about at the begin of last season i 'm glad to see him fare well for the padre though"
b"i stop go to a 's game some year ago while i still live inthe bay area for exactly this reason i believe the length of their game have be institutionalize by larussa/duncan they encourage their pitcher to be overly deliberate to throw to first often to study the catcher signal and so on and almost every a 's hitter take a step out of the box after every pitch this be not imo a coincidence this be plan and i hate it a for the gant situation i do not see the game or the replay but i do wonder what if gant have request a time out would hirschbeck have be require to give it to him could he have deny the requst for all he the ump knew gant could have have dirt in his eye"
b"wait a minute if i read the rule right a stike be any portion of the ball over any portion of the plate give that the ball be 2.9 `` '' in diameter this sez that the zone width be ~= 17 2 2.9 or 22.8 `` '' while this be still less than the 23 `` number give i can forgive any ump for misjudge .2 '' on an object move at 85 to 100 mile per hour many time not in a straight line i think the umpire union have a great grasp of the rule"
b"tim shippert recently post summary of last year 's defensive average stats in term of the linear weight estimate run-value of defensive performance compare to league average i 've combine those with my position-adjusted mlv number to come up with first-approximation total run value for player last year we can use these a a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award major caveat these number include no defensive park adjustment so if san diego really be just a question of odd score or gopher hole in the infield that will cause some inaccuracy the offensive number be position-adjusted but not park adjust so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair finally we still do n't know what to do about catcher and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contribution of tony phillips and bip robert have say that there be still some surprise let 's look national league first all number in total run contribute over the season player offense defense total sandberg 44 32 76 bond 67 3 70 walker 26 26 52 justice 14 33 47 daulton 44 44+ larkin 36 4 40 grace 13 27 40 a i see it these be the legitimate mvp candidate from last season if you deflate sandberg 's offense a wee bit for play in wrigley you get essentially a dead heat have bond be his usual defensive self it would n't have be close but that apparently be n't the case darren daulton need 22 or more defensive run to make up the offensive difference and i could n't tell you whether that 's easy or impossible a good case could be make for any of sandberg bond or daulton a top dude my personal vote bond sandberg daulton walker justice in the american league player offense defense total ventura 22 34 56 martinez 47 -1 46 b. anderson 21 25 46 thomas 47 -5 42 r. henderson 25 16 41 raines 17 23 40 tettleton 33 33+ ok let 's see a show of hand how many of you picked robin ventura a top player in the al last year i certainly do n't but i 'd have a hard time argue against him at this point yes i know these number be only approximate but that 's a big gap between him and the 2 guy also those of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year be out of your mind once again there 's a catcher in the ointment if call a game be a important a it might be 23 run be easy to make up or give away take a guess folk i do n't think we can do any well than that my personal vote exclude pitcher ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson i 'm a big frank thomas fan but i have to admit to a bias in favor of balance offensive/defensive contribution which should have a high leverage in w/l record than an equal shift that be lot of offense with negative defense for the record carlos baerga 27 5 32 roberto alomar 35 -2 33 forget it it 's a wash. let me also take this opportunity to admit that i be grossly wrong regard don mattingly 's defense this past season don recover brilliantly from his weak '90 and '91 to end up with mattingly -1 17 16 run which be clearly an above-average first baseman however it 's still 18 run behind mark mcgwire 26 run behind frank thomas and 7 run behind john olerud on the other hand it 's ahead of rafael palmeiro cecil fielder and every other al first baseman not yet mention"
b"you want to speed up ballgame 1. enforce the two minute between inning a it be many field be allow three minute between them fifteen second before tv commercial be go to thirty or so before action begin upon the return to the game two minute last out to first pitch or a ball be call 2. do n't grant time to batter just because they want it they may get piss at first but they 'll get in line once anything the pitcher throw while they 're adjust their wristband be a strike 3. mandate a rule permit only n second between pitch the current rule be too lenient and then enforce it fifteen second be more than enough time if the pitch be n't release in 15 call it a ball and restart the clock baseball game take about 2:51 in the nl and just a shade under 3 hour in the al that 's just too damn long i do n't like to play in 3 hour game much less watch a game for that long my butt fall asleep and if i 'm watch on tv i 'll channel surf between pitch catch colorize version of mr. ed leave it to beaver and `` those wacky nieporents '' on nick at nite"
b"umpire be not require to call time out just because a player asks for time only in extreme case like dust in the pitcher's or hitter 's eye should an umpire call time the batter have 20 second to get situate in the box and receive a pitch i 'm against put a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down 20 second between pitch and the minute for warm-up but i think umpire should tell hitter to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and instruct the pitcher to pitch the same go for pitcher ump should tell them to pitch or feint within 20 second or a ball will be call that 's the way it should be ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine"

b'pitcher be require to pitch or feint or attempt a pick-off within 20 second after receive the ball not 15. pitcher be require to pitch their warm-up throw within a one minute time frame begin after each half inning end not two minute and the reason why a reliever should be allow warm-up be simple different mound different catcher ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine'

b'consistently'
b"yes but a we be talk about peak level not career average and b clemente be the best fielding rf of all time a far a anyone can tell i do a quick scan last night look for player with a peak comparable to or well than winfield in my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement you could make good case for ruth aaron ott robinson clemente kaline mari klein jackson waner and probably a few others this be not a knock on winfield but a comment on his consistency all of those other player have awesome stretch and very good stretch while winfield have be more uniformly excellent hall of fame absolutely top-10 peak i 'm not so sure top 10 total career value yes almost certainly"
b"well then give your definition of `` best '' be it not conceivable that alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team need to win while larkin might not have that something the team need would griffin then be well than larkin no i be not try to define the quality of an individual at least not for the purpose of rank them toronto won with olerud they might have won with fielder they might not have won with thomas detroit might have won with thomas chicago might have won with fielder you ca n't rank these individual you can only look at who might contribute more to the team effort which be win the w thomas could not have contribute to that goal any more than olerud so i can not say that olerud be less of a player --"

b"we can not isolate completely roger but we can make a pretty good estimate i wo n't claim to split hair and say that we can really measure who be well robby alomar or carlos baerga last year the difference be too close to call but larkin and lee clemens and morris the difference be too great there in your measure of the game why should a team that have just won it all ever replace a single player since they be now clearly `` best '' how can they do well yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player a little well than one they already have btw by my definition the `` best '' player be the one who do the most thing to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depend on who else be on the team by have aptitude one team need more than others baseball be a team game but it be make of individual talent it be absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammate whom he do not choose at least in most case morris won last year because he played on a team with joe carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al clemens lose because he be surround by such lesser performer a herm winninham luis rivera and jeff reardon to define the quality of the team a a sum of it component a i do albeit imperfectly be a lesser error than define the quality of an individual a the mean quality of the team a my reading of your argument suggests you do"
