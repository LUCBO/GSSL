b"folk it 's time to start building some precise question to send to our federal elect official and to investigative reporter in our local tv radio and newprint medium ideally these question could be ask at any investigation into the batf 's and fbi 's participation at the waco fiasco in hope of be resolve and hopefully wake up the local news medium that they be not get the entire truth from the batf and fbi my list be up to 13 that be really nag at my gut the list will probably grow 1. what be the content of the original warrant now seal that the batf obtain 2. it be reasonable to believe that illegal firearm and/or ammunition could not be flush down the toilet therefore a `` no-knock '' raid could be rule out prior to the initial assault on the complex do a single batf agent and accompany witness without a contingent of assault and news medium personnel attempt to knock on the door of the branch davidian 's complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law 3. on the day of the initial assault on the complex batf agent be aware that several small child be inside the building in the ensue gun battle batf agent fire into a building know to contain child kill at least one two-year old child know child be present why do n't the batf have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the life of the child in the building 4. the fbi spokesman state that paper evidence indicates that david koresh and member of the branch davidians possess over 200,000 in firearm and ammunition do david koresh and the member of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearm license be they actively participate in the legal business of selling/buying firearm and ammunition and be any of the weapon they have illegally possess do this paper evidence consist only of weapon purchase or do it include legally dispossess weapon 5. after the original assault on the compound tragically fail a batf spokeswoman state `` we be outgunned '' yet tv newscast of video tape film at the time of the incident show batf agent arm with mp-5 and ar-15/m16 rifle although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's body they also may have have ak-47 and sks rifle what type s of firearm do the batf agent have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex 6. since there be no evidence to confirm anyone be inside the complex involuntarily why do the fbi treat it a a `` hostage '' situation 7. along the same line why do the fbi use `` psychological warfare '' technique include sensory overload sleep deprivation and other disruptive technique that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than use technique aim at place the complex occupant into a calmer frame of mind 8. report indicate several of the child inside the complex be accompany by their mother since it be reasonable to expect these mother would have their child take away from them if they come out why do the fbi expect the mother to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authority 9. agent at the scene claim to have see member of the branch davidians set fire to the complex branch davidian member who survive the inferno claim the fire be start when an armored vehicle punch through the wall and knock over a lantern which be set on a table video tape of the incident do show an armored vehicle punch a hole in the wall and the fire erupt almost immediately from the same general location be the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrate 10. fbi spokesman be voice the opinion that the david koresh and the member of the branch davidians commit mass suicide yet body be be discover throughout the house and other area within the building complex this seem to be counter to any know mass suicide through history what evidence do the fbi have that a mass suicide pact exist 11. fbi director session state that the massive fireball show on the video tape be cause by the branch davidian 's ammunition and/or powder cache explode yet the fireball seem to be more characteristic of the type create when compress gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes be any evidence found which would indicate the branch davidians have an ammunition and/or powder cache which explode to create this fireball if so and if david koresh and member of the branch davidians be engage in the legal business of selling/buying firearm be the amount determine to be excessively great than one would expect for someone engage in such a legal business 12. it be rumor that one fbi agent be extremely upset about critical news medium coverage and intentionally use an armored vehicle to crush a reporter 's car which have be left at the compound be there any factual basis to this rumor and if so what charge will be brought against the fbi agent who perform the act 13. fbi director session state that during the final assault on the complex `` over 80 shot be fire at the vehicle '' on the video tape of the incident you can hear the drone of the armored vehicle engine yet there be no sound of the sharp report that one would expect to hear if shot be fire also there be no indication of smoke and/or muzzle flash appear from the window building or other structure in the video surely these should be evident if the branch davidians have fire on the armored vehicle finally the video tape do not show any indication of paint splatter spark or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the branch davidians have fire upon the vehicle do any of the armored vehicle which be brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to be hit by shot from high-power rifle 14. c gas be consider to be a chemical warfare agent the united state have sign international treaty which prevent the use of c gas in warfare if the united state could not morally use c gas against saddam hussein and his troop why be it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizen of our own land 15. on april 21 fbi spokesman state that at least 3 body discover in the complex have bullet wound to the head indicate they have be murder or have commit suicide on april 22 the county coroner claim he know nothing about any body found with bullet wound to the head be any of the victim body found within the burn out complex have bullet wound to the head"

b"from article 1r0mhtinna59 cronkite.central.sun.com by dbernard clesun.central.sun.com dave bernard i notice that too special agent asshole actually rick state that david koresh have `` explosive that could blow up an armored vehicle 40 foot into the air '' it look like to me that the bd have plenty of opportunity to use these explosive -- -provided that they have them in the first place for example when one of the tank be inject c gas into the ranch house yes ranch house the bd be n't living in a fortress they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it be idle there for a considerable length of time so why didn't they do this could it be that they do n't have any explosive or similar munition i just do n't buy what the atf and fbi have be say hopefully the truth will come out here 's something noteworthy after the fire have be burning for some time an explosion occur -- -just *one* explosion the medium say that this be some of the explosive that the bd pose go off i do n't think this be the case my brother and i notice that this so-called `` explosion '' resemble a plume of propane gas be ignite we figure that this be what it be because of how the `` explosion '' look and sound obviously it be n't due to something like tnt dynamite or c4 i have see a propane explosion before ... the explosion in the ranch house greatly resemble this also i notice something that look like a propane tank in the char ruble the next day be n't it curious that the atf be n't very forthcoming about how the four officer get kill many week have go by before they state that some of the officer have be kill and/or wound by grenade thrown by the bd earlier when someone ask one of the spokesperson about whether or not an autopsy have be perform on the slain agent they say that an autopsy have be do but they be n't ready to release the finding now why be this do the atf have something to hide perhaps those four agent be kill by friendly fire what be the cause of death exactly no one have ever say what it be what be certain be this atf agent *did* throw grenade into the compound a a matter of fact mr. koresh hand his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer 's visit to the compound later on the lawyer give the grenade body i do n't know if it be a dud or a spent one btw to the atf how much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear at this point in time the only people we know who have grenade be the atf agent would n't it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenade rocket or explosive in the rubble the atf would sure have egg on their face then note that the atf be do the *initial* sweep of the rubble the fbi and the texas ranger wo n't investigate until the atf be do this look like a perfect opportunity for the atf to make sure that others `` find '' what they want for them to `` find '' if you know what i mean i 'm probably be a little paranoid here but if i be i have could reason to be recall that several week have go by before anyone say that the bd have use grenade also recall that early on the atf have *denied* that their agent use grenade on the bd someone be lie here scott kennedy brewer and patriot"

b"this be post by lyn bates to the firearms-politics mail list i recently learn that don kates be go to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situation of course this be all set up after the incident start but long before it unhappy conclusion so yesterday i go to hear him what follow be a rough summary of what i think i heard him say which should not be take a exactly what he actually say ... kates start by say that since he do n't know any more about the fire than the audience do it have just happen the day before he would not discus that but would concentrate on the original raid koresh definitely be not play with a full deck but so what this be n't the first time that the leader of a new small religious group have be ridicule by the public extreme religious view nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust the first amendment applies maybe especially to people like koresh lengthy digression into the history of police organization in the u there be none until about 1830 when they begin in metropolitan area police originally be not arm if they found a crime in progress they call local arm citizen to help many begin to carry arm for protection despite regulation against them eventually the law be change to allow them to carry gun the original intent be to have many small police department jealous of one another and competitive but not large enough to be a threat to liberty hence the plethora of organization range from postal inspector to the coast guard when the fbi be start agent do not have the authority oto carry gun they be to be after all a bureau of investigation not a police force `` all police agency will be misuse by anyone in power to maintain that power '' the batf start a a tax collection agency whose primary job be to raid illegal still when the price of sugar go up so high that moonshiner no longer found their trade no longer profitable many illegal still disappear and the batf need something else to do to justify it existence so it turn to activity like phony raid on gun store around the time when the batf 's annual budget be under review the medium be alert by the batf to come to such-and-such a place where at a pre-arranged time a bunch of car full of batf agent roar up to the door and the medium get great picture of the agent enter the premise of a gun dealer suspect of not keep book properly the medium isn't invite in for the boring hour of agent leaf through paperwork but if any irregularity be found the medium get to cover the agent remove armful of gun from the premise and the luckless ffl in chain the waco incident happen a few week before batf 's budget be up for review kates opinion be that it be a stag publicity stunt that go bad and that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at or they would have plan the raid differently not send 100 agent over open ground with no cover for example and would have have some medical personnel on hand he confirm that some year ago there be a warrant for koresh 's arrest in connection with a murder charge and the local sheriff call him on the phone and explain about it koresh sais ok come pick me up and the sheriff do temporarily confiscate all the gun so that they could be test koresh be later clear release and presumably get his gun back at least at that time he be rational enough to be approach rationally and behave in a reasonable manner the batf do n't take into account that unlike most of the ffl 's they audit koresh be actually paranoid and foster paranoia in his follower thus the pubicity stunt look like a real attack to them and they react accordingly with respect to the original warrant it have not be unsealed when kates be give his talk so he could not comment on it except to mention that the batf have be know to not double-check the veractiy of their informant if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant he have more to say about the way the warrant be serve which may have be completely illegal apparently the proper way to serve a warrant be to knock on the door and announce that you 're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so if they do n't open the door and the evidence be flushable then it be ok to break in the door but since it be hard to flush gun down the toilet there may have be no justification for the batf break in the way they do if the constitutional right of the davidians be violate by an invalid warrant or by an improperly serve warrant then the davidians may have be justified in their actons a close look at one of the original film show that one batf agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when enter the building if so this be the first shot fire the role of the medium could have be a whole lot bad after an initial position on the side of the batf the medium begin to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally arm citizen held off a bad possibly illegal attack a real cynic might say that the fbi go in when they do because it be clear that public opinion be begin to change side and the fbi want to act before they lose the public 's sympathy should the batf be abolish no police agency _should_ be numerous diverse inefficient decentralize etc well a few inept accident like this than a move toward a single large well-organized well-trained powerful domestic police force which would eventually have even more tragic result lyn bates bates bbn.com p don kates will be give a shorter version of this talk at boston college law school next tuesday april 27. i

b"and you should n't a the match kill more kid so why be you bleating about gun it may be tire but it be true no that 's not right either people who have both easy access and the desire to kill kill people consider that people who have the desire to kill turn that into easy access ... have n't you folk learn anything from either prohibition or the war on drug if you do n't affect the desire you 're waste your time not to mention the other cost incur good for them i note that the tm folk make the same argument if you 'll pay their expesnses 21 million for a reasonable size city they promise to meditate away all crime disease etc at least they 're not promising to jail me if i do n't go along with their little plan they 're go to just sit in a room and fly leave me alone ah but we have evaluate gun control use before-after and it do n't work to reduce crime what be the point we ca n't claim that it be symbolic a people do get jail no they 're essentially say `` we hope this will keep you from notice that we 're not do anything useful '' piss away resource be n't `` care '' nope you 'll merely be ignore a wright rossi and daly be after finish `` under the gun '' they be suppose to prove that gun control work so ... so who gas them give their previous experience with thug who threw grenade before yell `` we 're from the govt and we 're here to help you '' would a rational person think that the fed have their best interest at heart would you `` know '' that the gas be `` non-lethal '' -andy"
b"in massachusetts you will likely be arrest for murder but if you convince the cops/da that you use lethal force because of threat of death or serious bodily harm then the charge would probably be drop if you run away and be later caught then you will have a much harder time convincing cops/judge/jury of your innocence go `` on the lam '' be see a an indication of guilt by a lot of people"
b"so far there be no credible evidence that the bd 's set the fire themselves we only have the atf/fbi 's sayso law enforcement type would *never* lie to cover their as right no not love just share a surprising similarity of belief and method funny yeah funny how you do n't wait for the fbi spokesdroid late reversal of `` fact '' before proclaim the bd 's burn themselves to death"

with the authoritarian personality university of chicago press 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guy in wwii and by extension in other war in racial lynching ... i do n't think the book be perfect and the study of psychopathology have advanced ... but you can elicit koresh type from even the first volume so i think they 're onto something -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- how cult psychology work ... i 'm an amateur hope i 'm not hopelessly naive so long a koresh could `` own '' his people he make sure they didn't believe there be any life out there for them away from him otherwise he 'd koresh be nothing during the siege ex-davidians recount how he convince the people in the compound they survive only through his intercession with god to spare their worthless soul absolutely classic brainwashing technique ... a long a they believe him they 'd ignore batf/fbi/child protective service or even the red cross ask them to come out after all if they ever left him god would catapult them straight to hell and the combine force of the u gummint with all the goodwill in the world doubtful could n't save them for a second if i believe it i 'd stay and die too like the folk in jonestown for a prosaic analogy replace a cult leader with an estrange wife or husband and notice how many folk show up kill the ex and then themselves that 's the consequence of shatter `` cultism '' it really do happen all the time by the way the treasure ideal in such case without which life be meaningless be the relationship no matter how abusive rather than the individual 's partner ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- why no news do n't the fed owe the world an explanation i agree that official explanation be in order i can also see good reason for news blackout ... that no matter what those people would have die because koresh make sure they believe they have no life outside his influence hence it would make little difference when or how the fbi act he held them hostage a his trump against go to jail but nothing would really stop him from off them even if the fbi go away look at history rep leo ryan and some staffer visit jonestown at the request of constituent who have relative there once jonestown be discover and even though they kill ryan and his entourage ... they all kill themselves because jim jones knew he'd be bust internal argument ask to spare the child brought up by some of the woman in the cult be shout down there be tape ... the `` logic '' of say that no matter how bad the gummint be it would n't kill the kid be shout down a blasphemy and the people who brought it up be threaten with ostracism by people who by their own avowal would be dead within the hour i suspect it 's the same with the branch davidians there 's a book on jonestown by james reston jr. title our father who art in hell i do n't know whether it 's good never read it ... the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate report of child abuse or sexual mistreatment or organization buying full-auto conversion kit or shipping hand grenade via ups on the off chance of stumble across cult that would kill themselves ... so the only way the batf/fbi could `` save '' those people and future cult be by ignore such sign i suppose there 's another way outsmart koresh and trick him into let them go or somehow influence `` his '' people to abandon him while he own most of their mean of communication with the world ... a mighty tough row to hoe ... i suspect the fbi try to do that with blackout noise and other sensory insult however maybe they 're not very sophisticated or maybe the job be impossible it's certainly possible the guy run the show be a jerk ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- why the fbi might want to blackout during and coverup after ... if they be do a poor job of wean the bd 's from koresh they 'd want to keep it quiet so they would n't be embarrass ... if they be try to wean the bd 's from koresh they'd want to keep it quiet so he could n't outflank them or well-meaning bonehead from any point of view would n't screw it up ... i _hate_ play chess when the world scream in my face especially if at checkmate time people really die and i could be blame ... i do n't think ignore such incident be a workable policy unless you deny the fbi batf child

regard the militia clause a i have see i have not see any rebuttles with similar bone fides ... enjoy flame to /dev/null -- -- -- -- begin enclose article -- -- -- -- -- the unabridged second amendment by j. neil schulman if you want to know all about the big bang you 'd ring up carl sagan right and if you want to know about desert warfare the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf no question about it but who would you call if you want the top expert on american usage to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united state constitution that be the question i ask a.c. brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publisher -- who himself have be recommend to me a the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr. brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud a retire professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of '' american usage and style the consensus '' a little research lent support to brocki 's opinion of professor copperud's expertise roy copperud be a newspaper writer on major daily for over three decade before embark on a a distinguish 17-year career teach journalism at usc since 1952 copperud have be write a column deal with the professional aspect of journalism for `` editor and publisher '' a weekly magazine focus on the journalism field he 's on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster 's usage dictionary frequently cite him a an expert copperud's fifth book on usage `` american usage and style the consensus '' have be in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since 1981 and be the winner of the association of american publisher 's humanity award that sound like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduce myself but do not give him any indication of why i be interested i sent the follow letter '' i be write you to ask you for your professional opinion a an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united state constitution and extract the intent from the text `` the text of the second amendment be a well-regulated militia be necessary for the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe `` the debate over this amendment have be whether the first part of the sentence a well-regulated militia be necessary to the security of a free state be a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause contain the subject of the sentence 'the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe `` i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issue of political impact or public policy but be restrict entirely to a linguistic analysis of it meaning and intent far since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regard the consequence of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary '' my letter frame several question about the test of the second amendment then conclude '' i realize that i be ask you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter i be do so because a a citizen i believe it be vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of it result i ask that you do this because of that importance '' after several more letter and phone call in which we discuss term for his do such an analysis but in which we never discuss either of our opinion regard the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have insert my question for the sake of clarity copperud `` the word a well-regulated militia be necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cite in your letter of july 26 1991 constitutes a present participle rather than a clause it be use a an adjective modify 'militia which be follow by the main clause of the sentence subject 'the right verb 'shall the to keep and bear arm be assert a an essential for maintain a militia `` in reply to your numbered question schulman `` 1 can the sentence be interpret to grant the right to keep and bear arm solely to a well-regulated militia '' copperud `` 1 the sentence do not restrict the right to keep and bear arm nor do it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people it simply make a positive statement with respect to a right of the people '' schulman `` 2 be 'the right of the people to keep and bear arm grant by the word of the second amendment or do the second amendment assume a preexist right of the people to keep and bear arm and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringe '' copperud `` 2 the right be not grant by the amendment it existence be assume the thrust of the sentence be that the right shall be preserve inviolate for the sake of ensure a militia '' schulman `` 3 be the right of the people to keep and bear arm condition upon whether or not a well regulate militia be in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition be not exist be the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe null and void '' copperud `` 3 no such condition be express or imply the right to keep and bear arm be not say by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia no condition be state or imply a to the relation of the right to keep and bear arm and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia a a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arm be deem unconditional by the entire sentence '' schulman `` 4 do the clause a well-regulated militia be necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place condition on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arm or be such right deem unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence '' copperud `` 4 the right be assume to exist and to be unconditional a previously state it be invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia '' schulman `` 5 which of the follow do the phrase 'well-regulated militia mean 'well-equipped 'well-organized 'well-drilled 'well-educated or 'subject to regulation of a superior authority '' copperud `` 5 the phrase mean 'subject to regulation of a superior authority this accord with the desire of the writer for civilian control over the military '' schulman `` 6 if at all possible i would ask you to take account the change meaning of word or usage since that sentence be write 200 year ago but not take into account historical interpretation of the intent of the author unless those issue can be clearly separate '' copperud `` to the best of my knowledge there have be no change in the meaning of word or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it be write today it might be put `` since a well-regulated militia be necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be abridge schulman `` a a 'scientific control on this analysis i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the follow sentence '' a well-schooled electorate be necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and read book shall not be infringe `` my question for the usage analysis of this sentence would be '' 1 be the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the word modify each other identical to the second amendment 's sentence and '' 2 could this sentence be interpret to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read book _only_ to a well-educated electorate -- for example register voter with a high-school diploma '' copperud `` 1 your 'scientific control sentence precisely parallel the amendment in grammatical structure `` 2 there be nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restrict interpretation '' professor copperud have only one additional comment which he place in his cover letter `` with well-known human curiosity i make some speculative effort to decide how the material might be use but be unable to reach any conclusion '' so now we have be told by one of the top expert on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united state unconditionally protects the people 's right to keep and bear arm forbid all government form under the constitution from abridge that right a i write this the attempt coup against constitutional government in the soviet union have fail apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny be strong than the old guard 's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united state elect lawmaker judge and appoint official who be pledge to defend the constitution of the united state ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizen be put in american prison for carry arm own arm of forbidden sort or fail to satisfy bureaucratic requirement regard the own and carry of firearm -- all of which be an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arm guaranteed by the constitution and even the american civil liberty union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of right stand by and do nothing it seem it be up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arm to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elect representative not to take away our right and continue regard them a represent u if they do will we continue obey judge who decide that the second amendment do n't mean what it say it mean but mean whatever they say it mean in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the

'' so in answer to your question no false hope be not the intent i think the intent be to show folk that police be attempt to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether it effective or not look if you ca n't measure the impact of these program use some sort of pre-test and post-test evaluation what be the point it must be symbolic in nature the police be essentially say `` look if you have a gun lie around and you don't want it we 'll give you 50 for it ... because we care about the community '' if you i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these program we could become rich and famous"
