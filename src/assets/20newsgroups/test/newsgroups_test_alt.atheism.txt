b"false dichotomy you claimed the kill be *not* religiously motivate and say wrong not say that each and every kill be religiously motivate a i spell out in detail which killing do you say be religously motivate for example i would claim that the recent assassination of four catholic construction worker who have no connection with the ira be probably religously motivate at the time of write i think that someone who claim the current violence be motivate by religion be reach what would you call be when someone writes `` the killing in n.i be not religously motivate '' say it be motivate by a primitive notion of revenge and by misguide patriotism otherwise have to wonder how come mainland catholic be not kill by mainland protestant and southern catholic be not kill by southern protestant and so on take away all plausible cause bar religion and the violence diminishes markedly gee why _is_ that now possible to argue that religion *in the past* be a major contribute factor to the violence in the present but i know of any evidence that this be so and not enough of a historian to debate it give that the avow aim of the ira be to take northern ireland into a country that have a particular church write into it constitution and which have restriction on civil right dictate by that church i fail to see why the word `` past '' be appropriate the country also have a different official language write in it constitution and vice versa maybe motivate by a love of irish poetry your argument be fallacious jon for what worth i agree with all that you say about ireland above and more"

b"i think let atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth `` a traditional or legendary story ... ... a belief ... whose truth be accepted uncritically '' how do that qualify indeed almost oxymoronic ... a rather amuse instance found that most atheist hold almost no atheist-views a `` accepted uncritically '' especially the few that be legend many be try to explain basic truth a myth do but they meet the other criterion andrew the myth to which i refer be the convolute counterfeit athiests have create to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion include christainity in a rational manner and debate it claim -as the be stated- atheist concoct outrageous parody and then hold the religious accountable for belief they have what be more accurately oxymoric be the a term like reasonable atheist bill divine justice accord to the most fundamental doctrine of christianity when the first man sin he be at that time the you accuse him of reference mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all the requirement of myth here 's a good example of of what i say above read the post again i say `` acoording to ... '' which mean i be refer to christian doctrine a i understand it if i be speak for myself know it my purpose in post be to present a basic overview of christain doctrine since it seem germane bill with those who pretend not to know what be be say and what it mean when atheist claim that they do -not- know if god exists and know what he want they contradict the bible which clearly say that -everyone- know the authority of the bible be it claim to be ... should i repeat what i write above for the sake of get it across you may trust the bible but your trust it make it any more credible to me if the bible say that everyone know clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone `` know '' your allege god 's allege existance again i be paraphrase christian doctrine which be very clear on this point your dispute be not with me ... bill refute while the species-wide condemnation be justified those that claim that there be no evidence for the existence of god or that his will be unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself be no excuse 1 no they have to ignore the bible the bible be far from universally accepted the bible be not a proof of god it be only a proof that some people have thought that there be a god or do it prove even that they might have be write it a series of fiction short-stories a in the case of dionetics assume the writer believe it the only thing it could possibly prove be that they believe it and ignore the problem of whether or not all the interpretation and biblical-philosophers be correct 2 there be people who have truly never heard of the bible 3 again read the faq 1 here again you miss the point the bible itself be not the point what it contains it make no difference who accpets the bible or even who 's unaware of it existence christian hold that it applies universally because mankind share the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of god 2 see above 3 if you read my post with same care a read the faq we be have this conversation bill freedom you be free to ignore god in the same way you be free to ignore gravity and the consequence be inevitable and well know in both case that an atheist accept the evidence mean only bzzt ... wrong answer gravity be directly there it stop exert a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloid god exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity be obvious god a i say the evidence be there you just accept it here at least we agree bill secondly human reason be very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it be in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always come back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason always come back to the existance of `` god '' it have usually come back to the existance of `` god '' in other word it generally come back to the xtian god it come back to whether there be any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally pop up a the idea of a god so much a the question of what natural force be and which one be out there from a world-wide view human nature just make u wonder how the universe come to be and/or what force s be currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in `` god '' only exists in religious wishful think yes human reason do always come back to the existence of god have this discussion be we not bill i say all this to make the point that christianity be eminently reasonable that divine justice be just and human nature be much different than what atheist think it be whether you agree or not you certainly be not correct on human nature you be at the least base your view on a completely eurocentric approach try look at the outside world a well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity well this be interest truth be to be determine by it politically correct content grant extremely unhip to be a wasp male and anything european be contemptable but i thought this kind of dialogue the purpose of a.a be to get at the truth of thing but then i remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and i understand"
b"reply to frank d012s658.uucp frank o'dwyer the problem for the objectivist be to determine the status of moral truth and the method by which they can be establish if we accept that such judgement be not report of what be but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they can not be prove by any fact about the nature of the world this can be avoid in at least two way 1 by leave the good undefined since anyone who claim that they do not know what it be be either lie or so out of touch with humanity a to be undeserving of a reply if the good be undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that they know innately what be right you be back to subjectivism no and beg the question see below 2 by define the good solely in term of evaluative term ditto here an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person make it again incorrect and question-begging see below at this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths' pretty perceptive that prof. flew but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self-evidence be in the mind of the beholder of course by deny that subject/object be true dichotomy please explain how this help i see your argument i see yours it seem to rest on the assertion that everything be either a subject or an object there 's nothing compelling about that dichotomy i might just a well divide the world into subject object event it even seem more sensible causation for example be an event not a subject or an object furthermore if subject/object be true dichotomy i.e everything be either a subject or an object then be that statement a self-evident truth or not if so then all in the mind of the beholder accord to the relativist and hardly compelling add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shove in it entirety into the `` subjective '' category by an idealist or solipsist argument and that we have this perfectly good alternate set of category subject object event which can be reduce to subject object quality without any logical difficulty and why yes i guess i *am* deny that self-evident truth be all in the mind of the beholder if not what be left of the claim that some moral judgement be true all of it if nothing then no moral judgement be true this be a thing that be commonly refer to a nihilism it entail that science be of no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful how anyone arrives at relativism/subjectivism from this argument beat me this make no sense either flew be argue that this be where the objectivist wind up not the subjectivist furthermore the nihilist believe in nothing *except* science materialism revolution and the people refer to ethical nihilism the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains be that there be some moral judgement with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion be he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preference regard human activity '' and if those preference should include terrorism that moral opinion be not true likewise if the preference should include noterrorism that moral opinion be not true why should one choose a set of preference which include terrorisim over one which include noterrorism oh no reason this be patently absurd ... and also not the position of the subjectivist a have be point out to you already by others ditch the strawman already and see my reply to mike cobb 's root message in the thread societal basis for morality respond over there btw i intend this a a strawman but a something logically entail by relativism really any ethical system where value be assume to be unreal different to say `` relativists say ... '' than `` relativism implies ... ''"
b"exactly although this may be a dissapointing answer there have to be an interplay of the two personal ethos and societal morality a person's self-generated/learned set of belief be usually express on a purely mental/verbal level and usually find expression in society except in an impure not in the sense of bad state sometimes this have to be so also what if one feel oneself to be part of more than one society in a very real sense to use the obvious example there be a political society and a racial society and a gender society and sometimes they do not always agree on every issue ... yes perhaps with an infamous `` do what you want so long a it hurt others '' the problem with this be that it be merely say what you can do it be not a morality in that it propound any specifically prefer behaviour i 'll add a hearty `` me two '' however one could just a well say just because certain action be moral do not make them legal one still really get an impression of which one be truly `` right '' best regard"
b"yes atheist tend to claim self control and self ownership be you say that theist claim to not have self control i think atheist be '' dominantly arrogant '' they claim some god that have supremacy over all of mankind now this claim would be arrogant but atheist claim it most atheist do claim to own themselves i think any disagreement with this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant"

b"free-energy technology by robert e. mcelwaine physicist ninety to a hundred year ago everybody `` knew '' that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly it would violate the `` law '' of physic all of the `` expert '' and `` authority '' say so for example simon newcomb declare in 1901 `` the demonstration that no possible combination of know substance know form of machinery and know form of force can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distance through the air seem to the writer a complete a it be possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be '' fortunately a few smart people such a the wright brother do not accept such pronouncement a the final word now we take airplane for grant except when they crash today orthodox physicist and other `` scientist '' be say similar thing against several kind of 'free energy technology use negative term such a `` pseudo-science '' and `` perpetual motion '' and cite so-called `` law '' which assert that `` energy can not be create or destroyed '' `` 1st law of thermodynamics '' and `` there be always a decrease in useful energy '' `` 2nd law of thermodynamics '' the physicist do not know how to do certain thing so they arrogantly declare that those thing can not be do such principle of impotence be common in orthodox modern `` science '' and help to cover up inconsistency and contradiction in orthodox modern theory free energy invention be device which can tap a seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe with- out burning any kind of fuel make them the perfect solution to the world-wide energy crisis and it associate pollution degradation and depletion of the environment most free energy device probably do not create energy but rather tap into exist natural energy source by various form of induction unlike solar or wind device they need little or no energy storage capacity because they can tap a much energy a need when need solar energy have the dis-advantage that the sun be often block by cloud tree building or the earth itself or be reduce by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitude and high latitude likewise wind speed be widely variable and often non-existent neither solar nor wind power be suitable to directly power car and airplane properly design free energy device do not have such limitation for example at least three u.s. patent

of inventor joseph newman see science 2-10-84 page 571-2 tap electro-magnetic energy by induction from 'earth resonance about 12 cycle per second plus harmonic they typically have a 'spark gap in the circuit which serf to synchronize the energy in the coil with the energy be tapped it be important that the total 'inductance and 'capacitance of the device combine to 'resonate at the same frequency a 'earth resonance in order to maximize the power output this output can also be increase by center the spark gap at the 'neutral center of a strong u-shaped permanent magnet in the case of a tesla coil slip a 'toroid choke coil around the secondary coil will enhance output power `` earth energy fuelless propulsion power system '' by john bigelow 1976 health research p.o box 70 mokelumne hill ca 95245 during the 1930 's an austrian civil engineer name viktor schauberger invent and partially developed an 'implosion turbine german name 'zokwendle after analyze erosion and lack of erosion in differently shape waterway and develop sophisticated mathematical equation to explain it a described in the book `` a breakthrough to new free-energy source '' by dan a. davidson 1977 water be pumped by an impeller pump through a logarithmic-spiral-shaped coil of tube until it reach a critical velocity the water then implodes no longer touch the inside wall of the tube and drive the pump which then convert the pump 's motor into an electric generator the device seem to be tap energy from that of the earth 's rotation via the 'coriolis effect like a tornado it can also neutralize gravity a fourth type of free energy device be the 'mcclintock air motor u.s. patent 2,982,261 which be a cross between a diesel engine it have three cylinder with a compression ratio of 27 to 1 and a rotary engine with solar and planetary gear it burn no fuel but becomes self-running by drive it own air compressor this engine also generates a lot of heat which could be use to heat building and it very high torque make it ideal for large truck prevent their slow down when climb hill david mcclintock be also the real original inventor of the automatic transmission differential and 4-wheel drive crystal may someday be use to supply energy a show in the star trek show perhaps by insert each one between metal capacitor plate and bombarding it with a beam of particle from a small radioactive source like that use in a common household smoke detector one other energy source should be mention here despite the fact that it do not fit the definition of free energy a bulgarian-born american physicist name joseph maglich have invent and partially developed an atomic fusion reactor which he call 'migma which us non-radioactive deuterium a a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantity from sea water do not produce radioactive waste can be convert directly into electricity with-out energy-wasting steam turbine and can be construct small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city and unlike the `` tokamak '' and laser fusion monstrosity that we read about migma work already produce at least three watt of power for every watt put in `` new time '' u.s. version 6-26-78 page 32-40 and then there be the 'cold fusion experiment that have be in the news lately originally conduct by university of utah researcher b. stanley pons and martin fleischmann some u.s. navy researcher at the china lake naval weapon center in california under the direction of chemist melvin mile finally take the trouble to collect the bubble come from such an apparatus have them analyze with mass-spectrometry technique and found helium 4 which prof that atomic fusion do indeed take place and enough of it to explain the excess heat generate there be good indication that the two so-called `` law '' of thermodynamics be not so `` absolute '' for example the late physicist dewey b. larson developed a comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he call the 'reciprocal system which he describes in detail in several book such a `` nothing but motion '' 1979 and `` the universe of motion '' 1984 in which the physical universe have two distinct half the material half and an anti-matter half with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing between them with-out the `` heat death '' predict by thermodynamic `` law '' his theory explains the universe much well than modern orthodox theory include phenomenon that orthodox physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about and be self-consistent in every way some free energy device might be tap into that energy flow seemingly convert `` low-quality energy '' into `` high-quality energy '' also certain religious organization such a 'sant mat and 'eckankar teach their member that the physical universe be only the low of at least a dozen major level of existence like parallel universe or analogous to tv channel a described in book like `` the path of the master '' by dr. julian johnson 1939 and `` eckankar the key to secret world '' by sri paul twitchell 1969. for example the next level up from the physical universe be commonly call the 'astral plane long-time member of these group have learn to 'soul travel into these high world and report on condition there it seem plausible that energy could flow down from these high level into the physical universe or be create at the boundary between them give the right configuration of matter to channel it this be support by many successful laboratory-controlled experiment in psycho-kinesis throughout the world such a those described in the book `` psychic discovery behind the iron curtain '' in term of economics the market have fail inventor do not have enough money and other resource to fully develop and mass-produce free energy equipment and the conventional energy producer have no desire to do so because of their ve ted intere t the government be need to intervene if the government do not intervene then the total supply of energy resource from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out price for energy will increase and pollution and it harmful effect include the 'greenhouse effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spill rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue to increase the government should subsidize research and development of free energy by inventor and university subsidize private production until the producer can make it on their own and subsidize consumption by low-income consumer of free energy hardware the long-range effect of such government intervention would be wide-spread and profound the quantity of energy demand from conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie and country electric utilitie etc would drop to near zero force their employee to seek work elsewhere energy resource coal uranium oil and gas would be left in the ground price for conventional energy supply would also drop to near zero while the price of free energy equipment would start out high but drop a supply increase a happen with vcr 's personal computer etc. cost of produce product that require large quantity of energy to produce would decrease along with their price to consumer consumer would be able to realize the `` opportunity cost '' of pay electric utility bill or buying home heating fuel tourism would benefit and increase because traveler would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their car government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuel would have to be obtain in some other way and energy could no longer be use a a motive or excuse for make war many conventional energy producer would go out of business but society a a whole and the earth 's environment and ecosystem would benefit greatly it

b"very true length of time for discussion on creationism v evolutionism atheist and christian have be debate since and still debate with unabated passion 8- mike see referrences to `` creation v evolution '' several time in a.a and i have question be either point of view derive from direct observation can either be scientific i wonder if the whole controversy be more concerned with the consequence of the `` truth '' rather than the truth itself both side seem to hold to a philosophical outcome and i help wonder which come first a point out elsewhere my view of human nature make me believe that there be no way of know anyhthing objectively all knowledge be inherently subjective so in the context of a.a would you take a stand base on what you actually know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell the difference"
b"sorry about the delay in respond due to conference paper deadline panic alarm amount of agreement delete that `` complicate '' in fact where p h p hg come from more the other way around from p h p hg p hg where g be the complement of g and by axiom p anything 0 so p hg 0 so p h p hg in a sense hg be necessarily more `` complicate '' than h for any h and g so i may be splitting hair but what try to say be that irrespective of subjective impression of how complicate something be p h p hg hold with equality if and only if p hg 0. well `` p x a p x b '' mean that x be a likely to be observe if a be operative a it be if b be operative this implies that observe x do not provide any useful information which might allow u to discriminate between the respective possibility that a and b be operative the difference reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probability p a and p b p x a p x b == p a x k p a and p b x k p b where k p x a p x p x b p x so a and b be `` equally consistent with the data '' in that observe x give any pointer a to which of a or b be operative in the particular case where a h and b hg however we know that their prior probability be order by p h p hg although we know the actual value and this which allows u to deploy the razor to throw out any such hg certainly true but the particular point here be whether or not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spread the word now it seem to me a say that the observe variance in religious belief be well account for by the memetic transmission model but rather *less* well if one proposes a divine component in addition since i would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among belief thus my *personal* feel be that p x hg even equal to p x h in this case but be small h be memetic transmission g be divine component x be the variance among belief but i happily acknowledge that this be a subjective impression not that a statistician a such either but the idea be that both theism and atheism be compatible with all of the read my observation to date however theism of the type with which i be concerned *also* suggests that for instance prayer may be answer people may be miraculously heal both be in principle amenable to statistical verification and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable way this mean that these region of the space of possible observation which i loosely term `` appearance of god/s '' have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic since there be only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expends on make `` appearance of god/s '' possible must come from somewhere else i.e other possible observation all else be equal this mean that an observation which ** an '' appearance of god/s '' must have a slightly high probability under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff implies that such observation must cause my run estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a correspond decrease in my run estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis sorry if still a bit jargonesque but rather difficult to put it any other way since it do depend intimately on the property of conditional probability density and particularly that the total area under them be always unity an analogy may or may not be helpful say that hypothesis a be `` the coin be fair '' and that b be `` the coin be unfair two-headed '' use a and b to avoid confusion with h head and t tail then p h a 0.5 total 1 p t a 0.5 p h b 1 total 1 p t b 0 the observation be a string of head with no tail this be compatible with both a fair coin a and a two-headed coin b however the probability expend by a on make possible the appearance of tail even though they actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it come in this case from the probability of the appearance of head say our run estimate at time n-1 be e n-1 a and e n-1 b the observation x n at time n be another head x n h. the estimate be modify accord to p h a e n a e n-1 a -- -- -- -- e n-1 a m p h and p h b e n b e n-1 b -- -- -- -- e n-1 b 2m p h now we know p h the *actual* prior probability of a head but the multiplier for e a be half that for e b this be true every time the coin be toss and a head be observe thus whatever the initial value of the estimate after n head we have n e n a m e 0 a and n e n b 2m e 0 b and since e k a e k b 1 at any time k you can show that 0.5 m 1 and thus 1 2m 2. hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis a must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis b must increase even though both hypothesis be compatible with a string of head the loose analogy be between `` unfair coin '' and atheism and between `` fair coin '' and theism with observation consistent with both a tail which would falsify `` unfair coin '' be analogous to an `` appearance of god/s '' which would falsify atheism i be *not* claim that the analogy extends to the numerical value of the various probability just that the principle be the same quite so but this type of theism be what i might call `` the g in the hg '' in term of our ockham 's razor discussion and bin it on those ground the hypothesis have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model the theism falsifiable you have to we need in the above analogy to know *any* prior probability to deduce that the update multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis be less than unity and that the correspond multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis be great than unity you need to know the initial value of the run estimate either clear that after a large number of observation p fair-coin approach zero and p two-headed-coin approach unity all you need to know be whether p x ha be large than p x ht for observe x and this follow from the assumption that there be certain event render *possible* not necessary under ht which be not possible under ha and all else be equal any observation you like it really matter nor affect the reason provide that there be some possible observation which would count a `` appearance of god/s '' example of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation ok downgrade `` *does* interact '' to `` *may* interact '' which would actually be well since `` do interact '' implies a falsifiability which we both agree be misplace i 'll explain but bear in mind that this central all i require of a theism be that it *not* make the prediction `` appearance of god/s will never happen '' a do atheism before somebody point out that quantum mechanic make this prediction either the difference be that qm and atheism do not form a partition prediction include such statement a `` prayer be efficacious '' imply '' if you do the stats you will find that prayer be efficacious '' or `` prayer be *not* efficacious '' or `` verily i say unto you this generation shall not pas till all these thing be fulfil '' i think we have any problem of misunderstand here fine i claim that theism be false merely that the finite number of observation available to me so far suggest that it be and that a i continue to observe the suggestion look well and well i think you be an `` appearance of god/s '' be sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the correspond theism be unfalsifiable no by way of a counterexample let x `` the coin be fair '' or more accurately so that not x make sense `` the two side of the coin be different '' this be unfalsifiable by toss the coin even a string of head be consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of toss to falsify x in the limit it converse be falsifiable and be falsify when at least one head and at least one tail have appear oops sorry mea culpa we agree here `` the rapture will not happen on october 28 1992 '' say rapture would have falsify atheism to my satisfaction have it happen although it failure to happen do not of course falsify any theism other than those which specifically predict it `` no phenomenon which require the existence of one or more god for it explanation will ever be observe '' that about sum the whole thing up cheer simon"

previous out and be currently discuss it with eric rescorla b there 's little point in respond the same point everywhere i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply you still repeat that point i do curious since i believe that be the first time ever make it not that repetition would imply much more than your seem inability to understand you ask me the same question i 'll give you the same answer especially when in this case i know the answer to be true i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone be make the same point and push for time then i try to respond what i believe be the strong formulation of those point if that include your post tough this be usenet and life be tough all over c since there 's a great deal of response this always feasible i do my best to honestly answer question put to me you drop out of debate with some poster and continue with others you appear with the same issue every n month and start the dicussion at the begin again only debate this issue twice in a.a and occasionally in t.a the first be in response to simon clippingdale 's positive assertion that disagreement about moral value inexorably acknowledges that moral be relative it now simon have drop out of the debate for some time i take that to mean that he be either busy or bore with the topic i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty do you d i always understand what you say neither i understand you all the time usually one asks what the other side mean usually one do usually clear but sometimes you and i ask you what you mean other time you seem to get extremely uptight and i feel that debate against line noise sometimes i get tire and sometimes i have other thing rather do again this be usenet and life be tough all over go to have to deal with it e start to get personally insult i may not even put your name in the hat in future suppose to be a threat no a simple statement and an assertion that i be not answerable to those who offer me baseless insult for example those who accuse me of lie about my personal belief while also complain that i answer their question like that you what you sense be evidence for the sense to be there if only everything would be so easy what almost everyone sens be evidence for the sense to be there because to all intent and purpose it *is* there we have that argument for one your claim that everyone sens it be not found and you have be ask to give evidence for it often and then the correct statement would be it be reason to assume that it be there unless evidence against it have be found i have no problem with the second statement i have provide an argument that almost everyone sens that freedom be valuable the only cogent objection to this come from jon livesey and be offer by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concept such a freedom a good point and think about it your trick be to say i feel a be not right and so do many i know therefore a be absolutely right it neglect the possibility that these people consider a to be right a an effect of the same process restrict the claim of it absoluteness to those who have be subject of that process in other word refutes it you make the ontological claim you have to prove it nonsense my `` trick '' be to say i feel that a be well than b and so do almost any disinterested person i ask best evidence be therefore that a really be well than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the result system of value be self-consistent now get this `` really be well '' be an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that `` real material existence '' be a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true it be nonetheless a useful _assumption_ far more useful than the equally assume relativist '' trick '' to wit i feel that a be well than b and so do almost any disinterested person i ask however if even one person disagrees that a be well than b or if even one person dissent from mutually agree definition of a and b then it be the case that b be well than a for that person and nothing more can be say i say this be useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seek to maximise a can not morally take action against someone seek to maximise b e.g a terrorist to do that would be to claim that a supermajority 's carefully consider morality would be well than the terrorist 's which would of course be true but a no-no for an ethical relativist to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else be simply weasel word and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion for a similar argument i sense morality be subjective it do not hurt me to do thing that be consider to be objectively wrong by others if you mean that you do thing that some others consider objectively wrong and it turn out not to be the case for you of course this be possible it be neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense it serf a a counterexample for that everything that be subject to judgement be absolute and a long a you provide evidence for that there be something universally agree upon there be no reason to believe your hypothesis do this freedom with the proviso that i still have to answer jon 's objection that fuzzy concept like freedom have no objective meaning far in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it be independent of human or the attribute above look quite mislead not really what evidence be there that _anything_ exists independently of human be hard press to find any that logically equivalent when apply to value an analogous set of premise would be premise 1 some people believe that objectively speak the shortest route from my house to a bar be through the main entrance of the estate and down the malahide road premise 2 i checked it out and found that the shortest route from my which be much closer you would never deduce from these that there be no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that be seemingly how you derive your relativist claim use premise which be logically no different no moral be a matter of belief so far the people still believe that the shortest way be through the main entrance no agreement on *belief* here and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there be a shortest way and that there be a method to convince everyone of that it be the shortest way indeed in other word your analogy work only when one assumes that your premise be right in the first place if not it be a fallacy and if this be an argument for objectivism be right it though a demonstration that the argument you give me be neither argument *against* objectivism nor argument *for* relativism your gimmick be to assume in the first place that value real and to use this to `` prove '' that value real in other word you beg the question against me"

this be jesus the king of the jew mark -- the king of the jew luke -- this be the king of the jew john -- jesus of nazareth the king of the jew vinegar matthew 27:34 wine with myrrh mark 15:23 matthew say many stood far off include mary magdaline mary the mother of james and the mother of zebedee 's child mark and luke speak of many far off and mark include mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less john say that jesus 's mother stood at the cross along with her sister and mary magdalene matt.27:46,50 `` and about the ninth hour jesus cry with a loud voice say `` eli eli lama sabachthani '' that be to say `` my god my god why hast thou forsaken me '' ... jesus when he cry again with a loud voice yield u the ghost '' luke23:46 `` and when jesus have cry with a loud voice he say `` father unto thy hand i commend my spirit '' and have say thus he give up the ghost '' john19:30 `` when jesus therefore have receive the vinegar he say `` it be finish '' and he bow his head and give up the ghost '' matthew say that the veil of the temple be rent that there be an earthquake and that it be dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graf open and body of the saint arose and go into jeruselem appear to many beating jesus to the resurection mark and luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple be rent but mention no earthquake or risen saint john be the only one who mention jesus 's side be peirced matthew say the jew ask pilate for a guard to prevent the body from be steal by the disciple and for the tomb to be seal all of this be supposedly do but the other gospel do not mention these precaution depends where you look matthew 12:40 give jesus prophesy that he will spend `` three day and three night in the heart of the earth '' and mark 10:34 have `` after three day meta treis emeras he will rise again '' a far a i can see from a quick look the prophecy have `` after three day '' but the post-resurrection narrative have `` on the third day '' matthew say sunday at dawn mark say the sun be rise and john say it be dark mat 28:1 in the end of the sabbath a it begin to dawn toward the first day of the week come mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre mar 16:1 and when the sabbath be past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome have bought sweet spice that they might come and anoint him joh 20:1 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it be yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone take away from the sepulchre mat 28:2 and behold there be a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descend from heaven and come and roll back the stone from the door and sat upon it mat 28:3 his countenance be like lightning and his raiment white a snow mat 28:4 and for fear of him the keeper do shake and become a dead men mat 28:5 and the angel answer and say unto the woman fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which be crucify mar 16:5 and enter into the sepulchre they saw a young man sit on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they be affright luk 24:4 and it come to pas a they be much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shin garment joh 20:12 and seeth two angel in white sit the one at the head and the other at the foot where the body of jesus have lain matthew say the guard be paid to tell this story but no other gospel make this claim matthew say an angel at the tomb told the two mary and that jesus also told them to tell the disciple to meet him in galilee the disciple then go to a mountain previously agree opon and met jesus there this be his only appearance except to the woman at the tomb matthew only devotes five verse to the visit with the disciple mark say that jesus walk with two of the disciple in the country and that they told the rest of the disciple who refuse to believe later he appear to the 11 disciple at mealtime luke say two follower go the same day that jesus rise from the dead to emmaus a village eight mile from jeruselem and there jesus jioned them but be unrecognised while they ate a meal together that even they finally recognise jesus whereopon he dissapeared return at once to jeruselem they told the disciple of their experience and suddenly jesus appear among them frighten them a they thought he be a spirit jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preach to them john say jesus appear to the disciple the even of the day he arrose in jeruselem where they be hiding he breathe the holy ghost opon them but thomas be not present and refuse to believe eight day later jesus join the disciple again at the same place and this time he convince thomas once more jesus make an appearance to the disciple at the sea of tiberias but again be not recognise after tell them to cast their netson the other side of the boat jesus becomes know to them and prepares bread and fish for them they all eat together and converse the book of act far add to the confusion it say that jesus show himself to the apostle for a period of 40 day after his resurection thus contradict matthew mark luke and john and spoke to them of thing pertain to the kingdom of god `` and when he have spoken these thing while they beheld he be take up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight and while they look steadfastly toward heaven a he go up two men stood by them in white apparel which also say ye men of galilee why stand ye gaze into heaven this same jesus which be take from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have see him go into heaven '' act 1:3-11 paul outdoes every other `` authority '' by say that jesus be see by 500 person between the time of the resurection and the assension although he do not say where he also claim that he himself `` a one born out of due time '' also saw jesus 1 cor 15:6-8. matthew say nothing about it mark casually say that jesus be recieved into heaven after he be finish talk with the disciple in jeruselem luke say jesus lead the desciples to bethany and that while he bless them he be part from them and carry up into heaven john say nothing about it act contradicts all of the above see previous section mat 24:34 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pas till all these thing be fulfil mar 13:30 verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pas till all these thing be do luk 21:32 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pas away till all be fulfil 1 thessalonian 4:15-18 1 corinthian 15:5 12 matthew 27:3-5 minus one from 12 act 1:9-26 mathias not elect until after resurrection mat 28:16 then the eleven disciple go away into galilee into a mountain where jesus have appoint them `` and elijah go up by a whirlwind into heaven '' 2 king 2:11 '' no man hath ascend up to heaven but he that come down from heaven ... the son of man '' john 3:13 a you can see there be a number of contradiction in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of jesus if these be good witness you would think that they could get some of these important detail right in fact i can not find very many point on where they agree you would think that they could at least agree on some of the point they be supposedly observe because of the fact that there be so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection a present can not be take a literal truth due to the nature of the story i doubt if it should be take a any sort of truth"
b"i disagree in the end the *individual* be responsible for his/her own irrationality the individual 's belief in some dogmatic religion be a symptom of that irrationality atheist and agnostic i would imagine but yes that be my point an atheist would theoretically be just a ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion a a christian and yet there be a persistence of atheist among the rank of philosopher therefore the conflict between one's religious belief or lack thereof and the ability to be a philosopher must not be a great a you assert the fact that most philosopher may be non-religious be a secondary point a oppose to science practice by theist be careful here science do have a built-in defence against faith and dogma skepticism unfortunately it be not foolproof there be that wonderful little creature know a the `` theory '' many of u believe in the theory of evolution we have no absolute proof that this theory be true so why do we believe it because it `` make more sense than ... '' there be quite a bit of faith involve here well not all current belief be deficient but basically i agree ideally this be true in reality though you have to acknowledge that scientist be human scientist have ego and bias some scientist assume a particular theory be true refuse to admit the flaw in that theory because of ego problem or whatever and proceed to spend their time and money try to come up with absolute proof for the theory remember cold fusion not really i agree that we spent far too much money on the waco crisis 7,500,000 i believe especially consider the outcome my point be that mass suicide in the u.s. be rare jonestown be in guyana incidentally although we foot the bill for the clean-up and the u.s. have far more important issue to address compare the number of u.s. citizen who have die in mass suicide with say the number of u.s. soldier who die during one week of the vietnam war and you will see my point"

b"this response originally fell into a bit bucket reposting it just so bill think ignore him bill sorry to have be busy lately and only just be get around to this apparently you have some fundamental confusion about atheism i think many of these be well address in the famous faq your generalisms be then misplace -- atheism need n't imply materialism or the lack of an absolute moral system however i do tend to materialism and believe in absolute morality so i 'll answer your question an atheist judge value in the same way that a theist do accord to a personal understand of morality that i believe in an absolute one mean that i have one just explicit a in the line of posting you follow up that when i express judgment on a moral issue i be base my judgment on my own code rather than claim that it be in some absolute sense good or bad my moral code be not particular different from that of others around me be they christian muslim or atheist so when i say that i object to genocide not express anything particularly out of line with what my society hold if your be to ask why i think morality exists and have the form it do my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code be a prerequisite for a function society and that humanity probably evolve morality a we know it a part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large society thereby achieve considerable survival advantage probably say that god just make the rule neither of u can convince the other but we share a common understand about many moral issue you think you get it from your religion i think i get it and you get it from early childhood teach i think be reading the wrong sort of comic book but in pry through the gobbledygook i basically agree with what say i do believe that my mental reaction to stimulus such a `` god command the genocide of the canaanite '' be mechanistic but of course i think true of you a well my reaction have little to do with whether god exists or even with whether i think he do but if a god exist who command genocide i could not consider him good which be supposedly an attribute of god hmm yes i think some heavy faq-reading would do you some good i have a much place discuss value etc a any other person in fact i can actually accomplish something in such a discussion by frame the question in term of reason for instance it be clear that in an environment where neighbor tribe periodically attempt to wipe each other out base on imagine divine command then the quality of life will be generally poor so a system that foster coexistence be superior if quality of life be an agree goal an absolutist on the other hand can only thump those portion of a bible they happen to agree with and say `` this be good '' even if the act in question be unequivocally bad by the standard of everyone in the discussion the attempt to define someone or a group of people a '' exclude from discussion '' such that they `` can not participate '' and their opinion give `` no weight whatsoever '' be the low form or reason ad hominem/poisoning the well and presumably the resort of someone who rationally defend their own idea of right wrong and the bible -- jim perry perry dsinc.com decision support inc. matthew nc these be my opinion for a nominal fee they can be yours"
b"in article 1r3tqo ook horus.ap.mchp.sni.de theism be strongly correlate with irrational belief in absolute irrational belief in absolute be strongly correlate with fanatism deletion |theism be correlate with fanaticism i have neither say that all fanatism |is cause by theism nor that all theism lead to fanatism the point be |theism increase the chance of become a fanatic one could of course |argue that would be fanatic tend towards theism for example but i just |have to loook at the time in history when theism be the dominant ideology |to invalidate that conclusion that that be the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism be the factor to be consider bogus i just say that theism be not the only factor for fanatism the point be that theism be *a* factor your claim now back it up i consider your argument a useful a the follow belief be strongly correlate with fanaticism therefore belief be *a* factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this be *any* belief not belief in god tire to say the least i have back it up read the first statement i have read it conspicuous by it absence be any evidence or point the latter be the fallacy of the wrong analogy say someone believe something be hardly an information about the person at all say someone be a theist hold much more information far the correlation between theist and fanatism be high than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special feature of theistic belief truth by blatant assertion evidence gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on be all more reliable indicator and the really dangerous people the source of fanaticism be often none of these thing they be cynical manipulator of the gullible who know precisely what they be do a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leader believe what they say if you believe that incredibly naive you frank o'dwyer be living in a dream world i wonder if there be any base of discussion left after such a statement a a matter of fact i think you be ignorant of human nature even when one start with something one do not believe one get easily fool into actually believe what one say to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement the onus of proof be on you sunshine what make you think that theist leader believe what they say especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely follow by it opposite the practice be not restrict to theism but there for anyone to see almost an epidemic in this country just for instance if it be harder for a camel to pas thru the eye of a needle why be the catholic church such a wealthy land-owner why be there church to the square inch in my country now *some* brand of theism and more precisely *some* theist do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theist with this brush be bigotry not a reason argument and it read to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm a straw man and a usually in discussion with you one have to repeat it read what i have write above not every theism lead to fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism the point be there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism no some of it come from feature which *some* theism have in common with *some* fanaticism your last statement simply imply by what you say before because try to sneak in `` innate feature of all theism '' the word grope for be `` some '' bogus again not all theism a be be fanatic however the rest already give backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and theism and far the specialty of other theistic belief allows them to switch to fanatism easily it take just a nifty improvement in the theology truth by blatant assertion gullibility by the way be one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have a oppose to the case you be try to make because there be more about theism that the attraction to gullible people cause the correlation and the whole discussion start that way by the statement that theism be meaningfully correlate to fanatism which you challenged indeed i do a i recall i ask for evidence what be the correlation of which you speak and to say that i be go to forbid religion be another of your straw men interest that you have nothing well to offer i say it read like a warm up to that because an irrational and bogus tirade and have no other use than create a nice them/us split in the mind of excitable people such a be to be found on either side of church wall blah blah blah i be quite well aware that give everyone their right protects me well from fanatic than the other way round of course other people be always fanatic never oneself your wish to slur all theist seem pretty fanatical to me it be quite nice to see that you be actually imply a connection between that argument and the rise of fanatism so far it be just another of your assertion so you can do it 2 define `` irrational belief '' e.g. be it rational to believe that reason be always useful |irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason the latter have |been discuss for a long time with charley wingate one point be that |the belief violate reason often and another that a process that do |not lend itself to rational analysis do not contain reliable information well there be a glare paradox here an argument that reason be useful base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrational which be it bogus self reference be not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness be possible within rational system it be allow o.k. oval still beg the question however and though that certainly be allow not rational and you claim to be rational and all another of your assertion no proof no evidence just claim hey i learn it from you do i do good at the risk of repeat myself and hearing `` we have that before '' we hear a _refutation_ before so back deal with it you use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful someone who think reason be crap buy it you see that be unusually weak even for you the latter implies that my proof depends on their opinion somehow who do not accept that there be triangle accept pythagoras wow an incredible insight i have to prove them wrong in their opinion it be possible to show that their system leave out useful information respectively claim unreliable or even absurd statement to be information totally circular and totally useless their wish to believe make them believe thing be judge by their appeal and not by their information it make you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contains zillion of possible pitfall from belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proof they attempt truth by blatant assertion see a many bogus proof of the non-existence of god a i have of their existence rational system by the way do not mean that every data have to come from logical analysis the point be that the evaluation of the data do not contradict logic it easily follow that such a system do not allows to evaluate if it rational in itself yes it be possible to evaluate that it be rational in a system that be not rational by the fallacy of that system but since the validity of the axiom be agree upon that have a little impact a the possibility of a demon ala descartes this just parse sorry so far it just a matter of consistency i use ratiional argument to show that my system be consistent or that theirs the evaluation of the nor this prediction do not need rationality it do not contradict however your argument be a silly a prove mathematical statement need mathematics and mathematics be therfore circular anybody else think godel be silly stream of consciousness type what be that suppose to mean the first part of the second statement contains no information because you say what `` the belief '' be if `` the belief '' be strong theism and/or strong atheism then your statement be not in general true the second part of your sentence be patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysis but be assume to contain reliable information regardless of what process be use to obtain it be speak of religious system with contradictory definition of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here be a an often refute fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and far one can evaluate axiom in large system out of which they be usually derive `` i exist '' be derive if you want it that way far one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom what be it you be try to say that at some point people always wind up say `` this datum be reliable '' for no particular reason at all example `` i be not dream '' nope there be evidence for it the trick be that the choice of an axiomatic basis of a system be difficult because the possibility be interwoven one therefore chooses that with the least assumption or with assumption that be necessary to get information out of the system anyway like to see this allege evidence one do not need to define axiom in order to define an evaluation method for usefulness the foundation be laid by how one feel at all not how one feel about it i see you have no irrational belief but then fanatic never do do they |compared the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of |their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i agree with this until you be specific *which* theism to say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which i suspect you do not have use the traditonal definition of god personal supernatural entity with objective effect on this world usually connect to moral and/or the way the world work imo any belief about such god be necessarily irrational that do not mean that people who hold them be in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence some atheist be also scientist for example they use theism when do science or it be science please note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment a well they just prohibit formulate them a objective statement ergo nothing be objective fair enough |the affinity to fanatism be easily see it have to be true because i believe |it be nothing more than a work hypothesis however the belief say they be |more than a work hypothesis i understand this can you formalise your argument person a believe system b becuase it sound so nice that do not make b true it be at best a work hypothesis however the content of b be that it be true and that it be more than a work hypothesis test or evaluate evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because b already believe say it be wrong/ a waste of time/ not possible depend on the far content of b amalekites/idolaters/protestants be to be kill this can have interest effect peculiar definition of interest but sure now show that a belief in god entail the far content of which you speak why my catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example maybe they believe in it maybe the conjunction of `` b asserts b '' and '' jail/kill dissenter '' that be important and the belief in god be entirely irrelevant it certainly seem so to me but then i have no axe to grind here the example with your neighbour be a fallacy that *your* neighbour say little about others and there be time when exactly that happen nope not a fallacy it just go to the correlation you wish to see and tell me when it be not irrelevant why be such statement about amalekites and idolater in the holy book please note that one could edit them out when they be not relevant anymore because god err what do that say about that message excuse me the holy book and how come we have theist say genocide order by god be ok. a god be the easy way to excuse anything and therefore highly attract to fanatic not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatic can have on the rest of the believer happens again and again and again a god be neither the easy way to excuse anything nor the only way"

b'could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or tradition be view in a metaphorical way of course this be essentially what we do with homer or with other concept such a fate luck free will ... however there remains the question of whether the religious literature of -- say -- christianity be a particularly *good* set of metaphor for the world today also entirely unclear and to me quite unlikely that one could take a contemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential from the literalism and absolutism it carry now in many case'

b"about my reply it a society that be constantly on the verge of flame usenet diplomacy be the best way to ensure the voice of reason get through it kevin unfortunately you be now delve into field i know too little about algorithm your reason a i see it be very much along the line of roger penrose who claimed that mathematical 'insight can not be algorithmic in his book _the emperor 's new mind concern computer mind and the law of physics_ however penrose's claim that he _has_ mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusion we be obviouslu take very different viewpoint i try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realise that it might not be anything special but certainly useful think back of what i write do you think worm have mind or not they be able to experience pain at least they behave just like that yet it be conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a `` total synthesis of c. elegans '' from the element would such a worm have a mind this be true to some extent however i do not think that our brain work like computer at all in fact there be substantial evidence skarda 1985 skarda freeman 1987 that brain work more or less chaotically generate enough randomness for mental state to evolve our brain work much like genetic algorithm generator i suppose indeed this be extremely unlikely give the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain i suggest however that before try to understand our consciousness a a collection of algorithm kevin take a look at the reference i mention and think again i still think the best expert on the nature of a conscious mind be neurologist neuropsychologists and biologist but do not flame me for my opinion since they study being that be conscious the reason i be repeat my advice be that this discussion can not lead to anywhere if our background be too different and please do not bring qm into this discussion at all not all physicist be happy with the claim that our consciousness play some special role in physic i would say it again _brains be not computers_ forget this this do not mean they need something else to work they just work differently their primary 'purpose be perception and guidance of action self-awareness and high intelligence be later appearance you be still expect that we could find the idea of 'green in our brain somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical this be not how i see it the sensation 'green be a certain time-dependent pattern in the area v4 of our visual cortex and it be distribute with the help of area v1 and v2 to the rest of the brain indeed a fire pattern i have sometimes thought of our consciousness a a global free induction pattern of these local fire pattern but this be just idle speculation scientific american 's september 1992 issue be a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover there be two article on visual perception so you might be interested but again please note that subjective experience can not be observe from a third-person perspective if we see nothing but neuronal activity we can not go on to conclude that this be not the mind kalat 1988 writes about numerous example where electric stimulation of different area of brain have lead to various change in the patient state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area be stimulate without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview be quickly cure of his depression and start discuss a plan to seduce his girlfriend stimulation in the temporal lobe have sometimes lead to embarrass situation when the patient have start flirt with the therapist in conclusion there be evidence that 1 brain be essentially necessary for subjective experience brain damage be usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage 2 conscious process involve substantial brain activity in various area of brain when we think of colour our visual cortex be activate etc 3 consciousness be an afterthought we become conscious of our action with a half a second delay and our brain be ahead of our 'conscious will by at least 350 ms. thus i think it be fruitful to turn the question `` why do i see colour '' around and ask `` what be this i that seem to be observe `` since it seem that our conscious mind be not the king of our brain this depends on what be meant by 'seeing colour do a neural network that be capable of recognise handwritten number from 0 to 9 see the number if it be capable of sort them if you be ask `` why do an animal who be conscious of itself a an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who '' i have a good answer read my previous post where i write why a sense of identity help social animal to swap role and act more morally so that they unconsciously kill each other with newly discover weapon a bit extreme but this be the basic idea when early _homo_ become more and more efficient in use tool a sense of identity and the concept of 'self have to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for others and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantage for social animal such a early human if mind be require for this do this mean that until human mind come to the scene wavefunctions never collapse but remain in the superposition for aeon my how powerful we be this have be discuss before and i think this topic be irrelevant since we do not agree that mind be necessary and neither do physicist i agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physic need sharp mind to solve many real problem ok if you forget to take with you the reference i write about in my previous post plus the follow kalat james w.

correlate with fanaticism i have neither say that all fanatism |is cause by theism nor that all theism lead to fanatism the point be |theism increase the chance of become a fanatic one could of course |argue that would be fanatic tend towards theism for example but i just |have to loook at the time in history when theism be the dominant ideology |to invalidate that conclusion that that be the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism be the factor to be consider bogus i just say that theism be not the only factor for fanatism the point be that theism be *a* factor your claim now back it up i consider your argument a useful a the follow belief be strongly correlate with fanaticism therefore belief be *a* factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this be *any* belief not belief in god gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on be all more reliable indicator and the really dangerous people the source of fanaticism be often none of these thing they be cynical manipulator of the gullible who know precisely what they be do a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leader believe what they say if you believe that incredibly naive now *some* brand of theism and more precisely *some* theist do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theist with this brush be bigotry not a reason argument and it read to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm a straw man and a usually in discussion with you one have to repeat it read what i have write above not every theism lead to fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism the point be there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism no some of it come from feature which *some* theism have in common with *some* fanaticism your last statement simply imply by what you say before because try to sneak in `` innate feature of all theism '' the word grope for be `` some '' gullibility by the way be one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have a oppose to the case you be try to make and to say that i be go to forbid religion be another of your straw men interest that you have nothing well to offer i say it read like a warm up to that because an irrational and bogus tirade and have no other use than create a nice them/us split in the mind of excitable people such a be to be found on either side of church wall 2 define `` irrational belief '' e.g. be it rational to believe that reason be always useful |irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason the latter have |been discuss for a long time with charley wingate one point be that |the belief violate reason often and another that a process that do |not lend itself to rational analysis do not contain reliable information well there be a glare paradox here an argument that reason be useful base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrational which be it bogus self reference be not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness be possible within rational system it be allow o.k. oval still beg the question however and though that certainly be allow not rational and you claim to be rational and all at the risk of repeat myself and hearing `` we have that before '' we hear a _refutation_ before so back deal with it you use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful someone who think reason be crap buy it you see your argument be a silly a prove mathematical statement need mathematics and mathematics be therfore circular anybody else think godel be silly the first part of the second statement contains no information because you say what `` the belief '' be if `` the belief '' be strong theism and/or strong atheism then your statement be not in general true the second part of your sentence be patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysis but be assume to contain reliable information regardless of what process be use to obtain it be speak of religious system with contradictory definition of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here be a an often refute fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and far one can evaluate axiom in large system out of which they be usually derive `` i exist '' be derive if you want it that way far one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom what be it you be try to say that at some point people always wind up say `` this datum be reliable '' for no particular reason at all example `` i be not dream '' |compared the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of |their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i agree with this until you be specific *which* theism to say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which i suspect you do not have use the traditonal definition of god personal supernatural entity with objective effect on this world usually connect to moral and/or the way the world work imo any belief about such god be necessarily irrational that do not mean that people who hold them be in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence some atheist be also scientist for example |the affinity to fanatism be easily see it have to be true because i believe |it be nothing more than a work hypothesis however the belief say they be |more than a work hypothesis i understand this can you formalise your argument person a believe system b becuase it sound so nice that do not make b true it be at best a work hypothesis however the content of b be that it be true and that it be more than a work hypothesis test or evaluate evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because b already believe say it be wrong/ a waste of time/ not possible depend on the far content of b amalekites/idolaters/protestants be to be kill this can have interest effect peculiar definition of interest but sure now show that a belief in god entail the far content of which you speak why my catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example maybe they believe in it maybe the conjunction of `` b asserts b '' and '' jail/kill dissenter '' that be important and the

b"well yes this be the real mystery of the matter and why i be rather dubious of a lot of the source theory there be a number of place where the masoretic text mt of the ot be obscure and presumably corrupt these be reproduce exactly from copy to copy the ds tend to reflect the same `` error '' this would appear to tell u that at least from some point people begin to copy the text very exactingly and mechanically the problem be we know what they do before that but it seem a though accurate transmission begin at the point at which the text be perceive a text they may be add to and in some situation such a the end of mark material be lose but for the most part there be no substantial change to the exist text basically try to make a mountain out of a molehill some people like to use the game of `` telephone '' a a metaphor for the transmission of the text this clearly wrong the text be transmit accurately"

b'great start i realize immediately that you be not interested in discussion and be go to thump your babble at me i would much prefer an answer from m healy who seem to have a reasonable and reason approach to thing say you the creationist guy who make a lot of silly statement about evolution some time ago duh gee then we must be talk christian mythology now i be hop to discus something with a reasonable logical person but all you seem to have for your side be a repetition of the same boring mythology see a thousand time before i be delete the rest of your remark unless i spot something that approach an answer because they be merely a repetition of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought at all .. i have to congratulate you though bill you know a logical argument if it bit you on the ball such a persistent lack of function in the face of repeat attempt to assist you in learn which i have see in this forum and others in the past speaks of a talent that go well beyond my own meager ability i just seem to have that capacity for ignore outside influence'

b"society be the collection of individual which will fall under self-defined rule in term of un decision all the set of people who be represent at the un be consider part of that society if we then look at u federal law provide by representative of purely u citizen then the society for that case would be the citizen of the u and so on `` acceptable '' be those behaviour which be either legislate for the society by representative of that society or those behaviour which be non-verbally and in effect non-consciously such a pick your nose on the oprah winfrey show no-one do it but there be no explicit law against do it in many case there be be no definition of whether or not a behaviour be `` acceptable '' but one can deduce these behaviour by observation in an increasingly litigation mad society this trap be become exceedingly difficult to avoid with the infusion and strengthen of ethnic culture in american and australian to bring in my local perspective culture the boundary of acceptable behaviour be ever widen and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour for instance some culture dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticate animal most fundamental christian would find this practice abhorrent however be it moral accord to the multicultural american society this kind of problem may only be definable by legislation obviously within any society there will be difference in opinion in what be acceptable behaviour or not and much of this will be due to different environmental circumstance rather than merely different opinion one thing be for sure there be no universal moral code which will suit all culture in all situation there may however be some globally accepted more which can be agree upon and instantiate a a globally enforcable concept the majority of more will not be common until all people upon this earth be living in a similar environment if that ever happens"

b"i write imagine that 1000000 alterian dollar turn up in your bank account every month suppose far that this money be be paid to you by a your big-hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm let's suppose that this be a true dichotomy so p a +p b =1 trouble be alterius be in a different universe so that no observation of alterius be possible except for the bank you possibly afford it now let 's examine the case for a there be no evidence whatsoever that there be any such thing a a big-hearted alterian benefactor however p exists b-h a b p not exists b-h a b 1. on the ground that lack_of_evidence_for be evidence_against when we have a partition like that we dismiss hypothesis a turn therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that hypothesis on the same ground a before we dismiss hypothesis b the problem with this be that we have dismiss *all* of the possible hypothesis and even though we know by construction that the money arrives every month we have proven that it because we have dismiss all of it potential cause an *extremely* poor argument and here 's why premise 1 `` ... this money be be paid to you by either a your big- hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm '' thus each monthly appearance of the buck should it happen be an observation on alterius and by construction be evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm premise 2 no observation on alterius be possible except for the bank you possibly afford it you forgot to include this my premise be actually premise 2 the cardinality of the set of possible observation on alterius be one this be clearly contradictory to the first not if you state it properly trouble be on the basis of premise 2 you say that there can be no evidence of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise lead to the conclusion that the appearance of the buck should it happen be evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug voila a scream contradiction with my highlight sc but in a strawman argument there be only evidence for oneof benefactor bug no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug be possible that be ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ not evidence for bug and neither be it evidence for benefactor nor ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ be true to say that this hypothetical universe appear exactly a if there be no benefactor/bug two statement both would be false this be still contradictory it reduces to 1 alterian dosh arrive in my account be due to benefactor or bug 2 this be not evidence for benefactor neither be it evidence for bug meaning that it lend more weight to one than to the other 3 therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence can exist for bug but 3 relies on a shift in meaning from 2 when you say paraphrase in 2 that this be not `` evidence for benefactor '' for example what you mean be that no *more* evidence for benefactor than it be for bug yes what i mean in 3 however shift the meaning of `` evidence for benefactor '' so that it now mean absolute `` evidence for benefactor '' rather than relative `` evidence for benefactor '' w.r.t bug not really i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other i think this be just a communication problem what i be try to say in my clumsy way be that while i buy your theory a far a it relates to theism make prediction prayer your 'rapture example i buy your use of occam 's razor in all case where a=0 in my example one dismiss benefactor or bug on the ground of simplicity one of these be necessary to explain the dosh i brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so from what say in this post it seem you agree and talk at cross-purpose 3 be still in contradiction to 1 some sum may help with b benefactor b bug d dosh arrives in account 1 implies p b+b d 1 assume that p bb d 0 so either the benefactor *or* a bug which be responsible if the buck arrive but not both then p b+b d p b d p b d so p b d p b d 1 but 3 implies that p b d 0 and p b d 0. no this what i meant p b d 0.5 and p b d 0.5 with necessarily no new observation already see the dosh to change those estimate i be try to say again in my clumsy way that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these and precisely what use of the razor do in the case of god god be one class of hypothesis there be many others belonging to a set of hypothesis _one_of_which_ be necessary to explain something which otherwise would _not_ be satisfactorily explain it can be thrown out or retain on ground of non-rational preference not of science or statistic alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the ground that the answer be know or that the notional probability estimate be effectively useless be equal agnosticism/weak atheism a they do when the set m be fill by `` the universe be cause by x '' where x be god pink unicorn nothing etc and no observation tends to one conclusion over the other exactly the point i be make i think so we `` throw out '' any of these contrary to your assertion above that we do some people do simon and they think they be do excellent science my sole point be that they only observation which directly contradict the hypothesis h i i.e x where p x h i 0 can cause p h i to go to zero after a finite number of observation only in this case do we get to throw any of the hypothesis out exactly my point though i may have be unclear you say the diametric opposite which i guess be the source of my confusion i be merely try to illustrate the incorrectness of do so what try to say be that while you be correct to say that absence of evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this do not hold true for all or perhaps any version of theism and it true that those for which it do not hold can be discard use the razor on the contrary those for which it do not hold be *exactly* those which can be discard use the razor see my post on the other branch of this thread then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of if the razor hold for god then it hold for all like hypothesis which mean that assign p x h i =0 for all i though already establish that not correct to do so when sum p x|h i =1 over all i simply put anyone who claim to have a viable proof of the existence or non-existence of god whether inductive or no be at best mistaken and at bad barking mad luckily i make no such claim and have specifically say a much on numerous occasion you be construct a strawman here would you frank although that of course rule out my be barking mad in any case i could be barking mad in my spare time with apology to cleese et al but i think you miss the point once again when i say that something be '' evidence against '' an hypothesis that imply that observation of the say something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis reduce the estimate of p h data to zero if it *reduces* this quantity still evidence against h. no i get that talk about the case when a=0 clearly correct when a =0 and not construct a strawman though certainly possible that misunderstood what say however by any standard a system that say when a=0 god be highly unlikely and when a =0 god can be dismiss use the razor be a system purport to be an inductive proof that god either exist or be unnecessary to explain any or all phenomenon in my experience system such a this include those which purport to prove that god exist always contain a fallacy upon close examination if not what say then please put me straight"

b"this be a very good point i have already make the clear claim that khomeini advocate view which be in contradition with the qur'an and have give my argument for this this be something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested khomeini be dead really respond but another poster who support khomeini have respond with what be clearly obfuscationist sophistry this should be quite clear to atheist a they be less susceptible to religionist mode of obfuscationism so to answer your question the only way you can judge be by learn more about islam that be by reading the qur'an and understand basic principle once one have do this it be relatively easy to see who be follow the principle of islam and who be act in a way at odds with islam khomeini by attribute a superhuman status to twelve muslim historical leader be at variance with one of basic principle of islam which be that no human be be metaphysically different than any other human be and in no sense any closer to god in metaphysical nature"

b"first you seem to assume all atheist think alike an atheist do not believe in the existence of a god our opinion on issue such a capital punishment and abortion however vary greatly if you be attack the view of a particular atheist benedikt i presume then please present your argument a such and do not lump u all together a for the issue let 's start with abortion personally i do not support abortion a a mean of population control or contraception-after-the-fact however i support the right of any woman to have an abortion regardless of what my personal view may be because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body and the domain of legislator should not extend into the uterus my opinion and i be sure many atheist and theist would disagree with me i do not defend homosexuality a a mean of population control but i certainly defend it a an end to itself i think most homosexual would be angered to hear of anyone characterize their personal relationship a nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population level down a for atheist believe all value be biological i have no idea what talk about finally there be the issue of war and capital punishment an atheist can object to either one just a easily a a theist might you seem to be hung up on some suppose conspiratorial link between atheism and population control could this be the `` atheist cause '' you be refer to a few post back"
