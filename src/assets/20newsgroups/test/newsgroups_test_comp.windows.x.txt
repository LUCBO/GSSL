b"i recently correct the resolution on my sparcstation by change /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xservers from :0 local /usr/bin/x11/x :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to :0 local /usr/bin/x11/x :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 i determine that my 19 '' 1152x900 monitor be 85 dpi by measure the active screen area and divide by resolution however this have cause my application font to behave strangely after some research i believe this be cause by my application request font by family weight slant and pointsize i believe that x be grab the first font on the path with these characteristic and display it since i have only 75dpi and 100dpi font on my path the result be inaccurate i do have some speedo font but not for the family i be use helvetica i think this be incorrect the font should always be provide in the resolution of the display this never seem to happen unless you explicitly request font by xres and yres this be true of both the scaleable and bitmapped font for instance the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' will invoke a 75dpi font despite the fact that this be a speedo font the command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font depend on my font path despite the fact that x know my display be 85 dpi and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me unless i my application specifies a resolution x appear to pick a stupid default be this a bug be it a feature if so why be there anything i can do to get around this problem people have suggest that i lie about my resolution and specify a single font path 75 or 100 not both this would at least make my app consistent but i like be able to look at ruler that appear in my paint application and say `` yup thats an inch '' anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped font i can use system info sun sparc 10/41 w/32 mb sunos 4.1.3. xdpyinfo version number 11.0 vendor string mit x consortium vendor release number 5000 screen 0 dimension 1152x900 pixel 348x272 millimeter resolution 85x85 dot per inch xset q font path /usr/lib/x11/fonts/misc/ /usr/lib/x11/fonts/speedo/ /usr/lib/x11/fonts/100dpi/ /usr/lib/x11/fonts/75dpi/"

environment that conforms to the open look graphical user interface specification it 's compatible with the x11 window system from mit a well a currently sun 's news and sunview so you can intermix program write for any of those system it come from sun and also with system v release 4 from certain vendor openwindows be sometimes also call openwin or xnews after the program use to start it and the main executable itself respectively it should not be call window or 'open look or openlook a these term be either wrong or apply to something else a commerical openwindows source licence cost

library in openwindows q.v it be also often include in system v release 4. it be write in c. the release of olit in openwindows 3.0 be olit 3.0. olit support pass to usl then a division of at t now own by novell who replace it with moolit q.v. note that because of the nature of xt subclassing you will probably want or need olit source in order to develop a large application or anything else that us subclass see the proceeding of the 1991 x technical conference xview be sun 's toolkit for x11 write in c. xview be similar in programmer interface to sunview there 's even a shell script to help migrate source code from sunview to xview xview be often say to be the easy toolkit to learn if you be not familiar with x window the xview toolkit be include in openwindows and full source be available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and elsewhere the current version of xview from sun be 3.0. despite rumour to the contrary -- some even from within sun -- the xview toolkit be *not* about to be drop by sun xview *will* be include in the next release of openwindows unlike news on the other hand the xview toolkit be not likely to receive a much attention from sun in the future a olit the news toolkit tnt be an object-oriented program system base on the postscript language and news tnt implement many of the open look interface component require to build the user interface of an application it 's currently include in openwindows the current version of tnt from sun be 3.1 release 3 contains some incompatibility with tnt 1.0 and tnt 2.0 but sun be commit to support the api at least until they stop news support some time later this year and replace it with display postscript wail you might ask what be commit to mean in this context the answer seem to be that it mean absolutely nothing sun currently asserts that it be commit to olit however the c++ user interface toolkit uit consists of an object-oriented c++ class library layer on top of xview and a tool to generate code from devguide 3 gil file the uit also include feature that simplify event management and the use of postscript and color it be say to be compatible with openwindows v2 and v3 and presumably v3.0.1 since the release mention that it work on solaris 2. uit be not an official sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within sun it can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the mit contrib directory a uitv2.tar.z use binary mode where do motif fit in it do n't motif be an alternative graphical user interface that be be developed by osf it have a look and feel reminiscent of microsoft window and the os/2 presentation manager there be no non- commercial motif toolkits available although the motif source be sell reasonably cheaply by osf although motif be currently available on more platform than openwindows the open look gui be almost certainly use on many more machine simply because sun and sysvr4 have such a large instal base sun 's cd/ware volume 2 contains a roadmap for improve motif application by convert them to olit there be also note in the periodic table olit demo openwinhome/demo/olittable what be moolit moolit be a version of olit from at t/usl that let user choose between a motif and an open look ui feel at run-time it will be part of system v release 4.2. contact joanne newbauer jo usl.com 908 522-6677 what about that display postscript thing sun and adobe have agree that sun will include the dp extension to x in the next release of openwindows dp be essentially a badly design hack on top of a slow level 2 postscript interpreter intend to give a very small subset of the functionality of news whilst simultaneously be harder to use a i understand it the only real advantage it have over news be that the manual be much small be generally less complete dp be also available on more kind of machine performance on our rs/6000 be not suitable for interactive work what it will be like on the sparcstation remains to be see note that whereas x/news font be share by both subsystem the dp extension to x do _not_ make type 1 postscript font available to ordinary x11 program it be not like atm on a pc in this regard there be at least one third-party version which do make font available however subject window manager -- olwm olvwm what be olwm and olvwm they be window manager a window manager be the part of the x window system e.g x11 that be responsible for decide how to lay out window on the screen and for manage the user 's interaction with the window olwm be the standard open look window manager it 's include with all of the openwindows q.v implementation and you can also get the source by ftp since sun donate it olvwm be a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop hence the v in it name it show a little map on the screen with the currently displayed area represent by a little rectangle you can move around by drag the rectangle or with the arrow key this let you run several client application and move the display around from one to the other olvwm be derive from the openwindows 3.0 olwm by scott oak you need to have xview 3.0 to compile it get olvwm from an ftp site such a export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory there be three patch can i use my favorite window manager with openwindows instead of olwm yes if you use twm for example or mwm you wo n't be able to use the pin and unpin feature of olwm and you probably wo n't see the footer some window use to display certain message if you use twm you 'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menu and get rid of program that do n't have a quit button when not run under olwm for twm put this in your home/.twmrc lefttitlebutton `` target '' f.delete where `` target '' be a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/x11/bitmaps alternatively try add a menu to each window manage by twm or tvtwm lefttitlebutton `` menu '' f.menu `` ol.menu '' menu `` ol.menu '' `` quit '' f.delete for mwm you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window i be told see the manual page for your window manager twm etc subject openwindows terminal and other display can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindows or on an x terminal the openwindows xnews server combine sunview news postscript and x11 this mean that it can run program compile for any of those system unfortunately it mean that some openwindows program need either news or sunview support and thus wo n't run on an x terminal this include pageview in particular you can use olwm or olvwm see above on an x terminal or a non-open- window display and most open look client e.g olit or xview one will work perfectly well you may find that you get complaint about font not be found if so see the font section below if you be run the window manager built-in to an ncd terminal you may have problem with input focus set *input true in the terminal's xdefault file in /usr/lib/x11/xdm may or may not help subject configuration file get start with openwindows what configuration file do i need to know about .xinitrc and .xsessionrc the first time you run openwindows a .xinitrc file will be create in your login directory home if it already exists you might have to edit it somewhat it 's simplest to move it and any other old x11 file you have to another directory and then merge the old and new file if your site us xdm you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc since xdm do n't look at your .xinitrc file .openwin-init .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys these be optional file you can create in your home directory depend on which version of olwm or olvwm you use look in openwinhome/lib normally /usr/openwin/lib for these file without the lead and copy any you want to change you may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognize if you be not on an x terminal you will want to run a console window such a cmdtool -c shelltool -c xterm -c or chuck musciano 's `` contool '' program so that system output will be direct there instead of write over your screen note that .openwin-sys be not execute unless you edit .xinitrc .xdefaults you can put x window resource specification in here in particular it be a good idea to include at least openwindows.focuslenience true *input true these allow non-icccm-compliant program to receive input even if they forget to ask for it prop the program that run when you select property from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choice into .xdefaults do n't put comment in .xdefaults since prop deletes them .startup.ps this be the news user profile file read by openwindows actually xnews on startup this be document in the news program manual near the back the most useful thing to put here be postscript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the postscript mean that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange way the news manual give code that be both incorrect and insufficient warn thing in this file rarely work on both openwindows 2 and 3. note that the mouse speed be best set in your .xinitrc with xset m see the man page for xset `` man xset '' and `` xset -help '' for more information here 's what home/.startup.ps should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second 300000 microsecond and a repeat rate of twenty or so key per second 30000 microsecond between repeat for openwindows 3. you 'll have to experiment a bit because the repeattime be the delay between key sent and thus do n't include the time to process each key which be probably high on my 4/110 than on your supersparc 10/51 gti injection again this be for openwindows 3 ... do n't want the demo see p. xxxii of news toolkit reference

you can use xmodmap to change the mouse button but be prepared for one or two occasional surprise see also `` man 7 xview '' for a list of keybindings you can change at least for xview program with openwindows 2.0 you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mapping and then let sunview handle them the status return by svenv should tell you whether your server be run under sunview or not put this in your .xinitrc if eval svenv -env then xmodmap -e `` pointer 1 2 3 '' input_from_defaults else xmodmap -e `` pointer 3 2 1 '' fi how can i get the screen to go blank when the system be idle run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can it 's a boring but effective screen saver see man screenblank under solaris 2 you 'll need to copy screenblank from an old system a it 's not supply then add

say select the text you want to copy by drag the select mouse button in xterm press copy in the xterm this key be l6 or meta+c the o'reilly xview manual get this wrong move to the textedit window and press paste l8 or meta+v if this do n't work see trouble shoot cut and paste to go the other way from textedit to xterm select the text in textedit no need to use copy move to the xterm window and press adjust the middle mouse button you can also use the copy/cut and paste button copy/paste be boring what short-cuts be available quick copy within textedit mailtool etc click select to get a text caret where you want the copy text to go press and hold down the paste or cut button select the text you want to copy/move you 'll see that it 's underlined or cross out a appropriate in the jed demo it go grey let go of the paste or cut button the text you underlined or cross out appear at the insert caret drag and drop to move a selection select the text you want to copy or move by drag or multiple- click the select or adjust mouse button put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection press and hold down down the select mouse button and move the mouse pointer a little to the right you 'll see the cursor change to be the first 3 letter of the text or some other icon still hold select down move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text you may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target to show that it 's ok to drop thing here let go of select and the text be move this work in text field of dialogue box a well a in text subwindows drag and drop to

remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that help see also the next item cut copy and paste do n't work at all openwindows only oh dear use p -xuaww grep xv to check that sv_xv_sel_svc be run and that either you or root start it depend on whether you start openwindows with `` openwin '' or by log in through xdm if not start it if it dy check that there be no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc before restart it you may need to be root to remove it or you can reboot your workstation check that there be space in /tmp use `` df /tmp '' and also see if there be a lot of file there with name like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246 if there be several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it time out quit any deskset tool such a mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/text* file that be still there it 's simplest to quit openwin and start it again after do that if cut and paste be broken but if it start work again you can just carry on note that file in /tmp not own by you might be in use by another worker comrade so do n't remove those without check first subject trouble shoot not authorize to use display if you get error message that look like xlib connection to `` :0.0 '' refuse by server xlib internal error during connection authorization check error ca n't open display try on the machine run openwindows or x11 xhost +machine where `` machine '' be the computer on which you ran the command that fail if you want to let other user run program on the same machine a you use your display you will have to type the bizarre-looking xhost hostname or xhost +happyboy if happyboy be the name of your workstation this let any user on happyboy access your display with openwindows 3.0 you can also use xauth and the programmer 's guide describes how to do this in chapter 8 p. 101. this be more secure also check the man page for fbtab 5 to stop other user access the framebuffer directly also note that there be a sun patch for openwindows 3.0 under sunos 4.1.1 to fix a serious security problem it be available through your local sun answer center a well a through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net 192.48.96.2 system

have a hostname before the or be empty have the system administrator change the cron script to skip socket subject trouble shoot other common problem i get console error message on my screen and they do n't go away sun 3 or 4 if `` refresh '' make the message vanish but new one come along later you need to run `` xterm -c '' from your .xinitrc or start one up in the background and then choose save workspace from the workspace- utility menu well still pick up `` contool '' and run that get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory it will monitor the console and open flash it icon or beep when a message appear it 's very easy to configure if `` refresh '' from the workspace- utility menu do n't make the message go away ... a sun with a cg4 frame buffer have two screen you can move the mouse off the right-hand by default edge of the screen and onto a whole new but monochrome display call `` :0.1 '' see the man page for openwin i have a shell script that check for this and if there 's a /dev/cgfour0 do openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 if you be run x11 or openwindows 2 you might need to add this to your .xinitrc or other startup file eval svenv -display unix:0.1 -env olvwm -display unix:0.1 later release of olwm and olvwm do this automatically you can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the message also see the note about contool above be there an easy way of edit .xdefaults use prop which appear in the default root menu a property this start prop a property editor which will re-write your .xdefaults after remove comment it then applies any change keep comment by use `` comment '' instead of `` `` for example comment *.font palatino-italic-37 how do i get the file manager to use emacs instead of textedit set the default editor to sh -c `` exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 '' file\\ '' '' you can change the font if you prefer a small one how do i run openwindows in inverse video this tends not to work under openwindows 2. with opwnwindows 3.0 there be various way include use -bg and -fg option if you're use openwindows 2 on a sun 3 probably the best you can do short of upgrade the workstation to a sparc be to use xterm instead of cmdtool why do n't flat check-boxes work a know bug may make guide 's output dump core if you use these a workaround be to edit the guide output a it 's only guide 's output that 's broken not the actual check-box code this applies only to version of devguide before devguide 3.0. if you're still use an ancient devguide you should upgrade a soon a possible the new one be fantastic when i leave openwindows my screen go blank or my mouse cursor stay on the screen try run clear_colormap if this help put it a the last line in the shell script you use to start openwindows e.g openwin when i use snapshot the system crash or the server hang or something this be a bug related to some system only the only work-round be to use some other screen dump program such a xwd xv 2.21 or xgrabsc why have some of my function key stop work key f11 and f12 change from sunf36 and sunf37 to sunxk_f36 and sunxk_f37 respectively in openwindows 3. application must be recompiled or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back again when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit i get the sunview version see under `` trouble shoot strange error message '' below see also next item mix x11 and openwindows see also next item note that openwindows 3.0 include the x11r4 core distribution to patch level 18 but not the contrib directory these note apply to openwindows 2.0 although you could also the do same sort of thing with openwindows 3.0 and x11r5 install the x11 library in /usr/lib/x11 you can intermix openwindows and x11r4 or x11r5 they 're all compatible in this respect put the x11 binary in for example /usr/bin/x11 put /usr/bin/x11 last in your path so that you get openwindows version of program instead of x11 one where appropriate although this be a matter of preference in any event put the openwindows bin directory first -- see the precede item for more detail on that if you have /bin or /usr/bin they 're the same directory on sunos earlier in your path than openwinhome/bin/xview you 'll get sunview program instead of openwindows one set ld_library_path so that /usr/openwin/lib be last after the x11 library directory this do n't matter with openwindows 3.0 but with old version you 'll get error message from x11 program if you don't do this the message be generally harmless see next item although xdm core dump if this be n't right set openwinhome to the directory contain openwindows if it isn't /usr/openwin see also environment variable especially xfilesearchpath i get error message on my screen about ld.so libx11.so.4 not found set ld_library_path to be /usr/openwin if you also use x11 use /usr/lib /usr/5lib /usr/openwin/lib if you put this in a shell script or your .profile use openwinhome-/usr/openwin /lib instead of /usr/openwin this be for /bin/sh for csh it be different i launch my filemgr and i get ld.so map heap error 9 at /dev/zero your system need to be patch look in openwinhome/lib/ospatches and install the patch why do n't answerbook run for me you must be run openwindows to use answerbook it wo n't run under x11 on an x terminal or on anything else because it us news to draw the postscript text and picture if you be use openwindows 3.0 you need to use the openwindows 3.0 compatible navigator it 's call .navigator.ow3 on the answerbook cd/rom if all answerbook user be use openwindows 3.0 you can replace navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia the navigator.ow3 binary be also on cd/ware vol 2. note that the data file be in postscript so you can look at them with a postsript viewer q.v. why be n't there any fish in realxfishdb a fix version of realxfishdb be available by ftp from ftp.eng.auburn.edu 131.204.10.91 a /pub/realxfishdb.z why be the property choice disabled in the window menu it be n't implement yet many program do respond to the property key l3 though or have a pop-up menu with property on it file completion in the c-shell be broken in cmdtool sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and it 's fine it also work if you run command tool on a remote

run several program the color on the screen all change when i move into a different window `` colormap flash '' this be becasue most hardware can only display a few color at a time however you can minimise the effect with the follow procedure start all the application with color that you wish to reserve run cmap_compact save to create the .owcolors file put the line cmap_compact init near the start of your start-up file .xinitrc exit and then restart the window system cmap_compact init will push those color .owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserve them also note that control-l2 lock the color of the current window and control-l4 unlocks them -- this be described in the olwm manual page pageiew us the wrong color or make the colormap flash see above this problem be report by

b"for flexibility anyway what you say be not really true the color information be associate with a graphicscontext not with a display and the gc _is_ a parameter to the draw routine so if you need to fast switch between green dot line and blue one of width 2 you can make 2 gc for those case and then simply do xdrawline dpy win gc_red x1 y1 x2 y2 xdrawline dpy win gc_blue x3 y3 x4 y4 for this effect this be eventually more complicate to do for the programmer but also much more efficient and flexible you would not include all the other parameter like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every draw call so why do it for color btw stay away from xdrawpoint if you do n't really need it to draw random point for image transfer there be image routine"

b"some people work a few cube over have come up with this need and it seem that someone out there just might have do it already and can point me to some tool that would help what they 'd like to do be give a window that be take a long time to draw because either the data be arrive over a slow link or the display be across a slow link they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of the picture and then repaint it in high resolution thus the picture might first be generate in 1/4 resolution with each 4x4 square of pixel be fill in with a single color next each 4x4 square would be replace by 4 2x2 square finally the 1x1 version would be paint since one of the scenario be with the window be on the other side of a slow link the low-res version obviously would n't be transmit a a bitmap that would n't help at all instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the low-res picture a a small bitmap and blow up each pixel into a square sorta like the magnifier program do this brings up the question of whether the x server can help that be when a window be open be there a way to ask that a `` filter '' program be run to process the pixel or be the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process `` permission deny '' and have it open a local window it seem the most likely scenario be a library routine that start up such a program remotely and then accepts bitmap compress each one by some amount and send them to the remote program to expand but if there be something that x itself can do to help it 's be nice to hear about it i look in several fm but if it 's there i obviously do n't know the keywords if someone have a nifty tool available that package it all we might want to get a copy oh yes this be to run on some sun part of the idea be to build demo that can show such thing a `` if this be run across say a 4800-bps link this be how fast the picture would appear '' then the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for"

-- -- -- -- -- -- window manager -- -- -- -- -- -- -- there be a lot of window manager out there with lot of different feature and ability the choice of which to use be by necessity a balance act between performance and useful feature at this point most respondent have agree upon `` twm '' a the best candidate for a speedy window manager a couple of generic trick you can try to soup up your window manger be turn off unnecessary thing like `` zoom '' and `` opaque move '' also if you lay out your window in a tile manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raise and lower overlap window joe english joe trystero.art.com i 've found that a good font for tile be 7x13 aka -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal -- 13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 it be the big font i know of that i can use on my sun 1152x900 screen and still get two 80 column terminal window side-by-side on the display with no overlap other font suggestion will be accepted -- -- -- -- -- -- the x server -- -- -- -- -- -- which server make sure that your server be a proper match for your hardware if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x11 server on my monochrome sun i have n't notice much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it be point out to me that xsunmono be about 800k small and therefore should contribute to less page thanks to jonny farringdon j.farringdon psychol.ucl.ac.uk michael salmon michael.salmon eos.ericsson.se how your server be compile can also make a difference jeff law law schirf.cs.utah.edu advises u that on a sun system x should be compile with gcc version 2 or with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect to get `` *very* large speedup in the server '' by not use the bundle sunos compiler i assume that similar result would occur if you use one of the other high-quality commercial compiler on the market lock the server into ram have anyone try hack the x server so that it be lock into ram and do not get page eg via a call to plock do this help performance at all i 've have one inquiry on this topic and a few pointer to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone who 's try it i be not in a position to give it a try thanks to eric c claeys ecc eperm.att.com danny backx db sunbim.be juan d. martin juando cnm.us.es start your server joe english joe trystero.art.com if you start up a lot of client in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launch each one after i change my .xclients script to do this log in actually take *less* time ... we have a heavily load system without much core though this sound crazy but i have confirm that it work warner losh imp solbourne.com provide me with a good explanation of why this work which i have summarize here when you start up an x server it take a huge amount of time to start accept connection a lot of initialization be do by the server when it start this process touch a large number of page any other process run at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself sort out before the client start up similarly there be also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program start toolkits register widget resource be fetch program initialize state and `` database '' and so forth all this activity be typically memory intensive once this initialization be do `` the process have reach a steady state '' the memory usage typically settle down to use only a few page by use sleep to stagger the launch of your client in your .xinitrc you avoid them fight each other for your workstation 's limited resource this be most definitely a `` your mileage may vary '' situation a there be so many variable to be consider available ram local swap space load average number of user on your system which client you be start etc currently in my .xinitrc i have a situation like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm i 've experiment with sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 2 exec xbiff sleep 3 exec xterm sleep 4 exec xterm i 've even try sleep 2 exec start_x_clients_script and then in start_x_clients_script i have sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm the idea with this last one be to make sure that xinit have completely finish processing my .xinitrc and have settle down into a `` steady state '' before the sleep expire and all my client be launch all of these yield fairly comparable result and so i just stuck with my current setup for it simplicity you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suit you font load font take time and ram if you minimize the number of font your application use you 'll get speed increase in load-up time one simple strategy be to choose a small number of font one small one large one roman whatever suit you and configure all your client -- or at least all your heavily use client -- to use only those few font client program should start up quicker if their font be already load into the server this will also conserve server resource since few font will be load by the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au joe english joe trystero.art.com eg my main xterm font be 7x13 so i also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it 's menu and icon etc twm 's default font be 8x13 since i do n't normally use 8x13 i 've eliminate one font from my server oliver jones oj roadrunner.pictel.com keep font local to the workstation rather than load them over nfs if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable font use a font server about the resource file keep your .xresources .xdefaults file small save ram and save on server startup time joe english joe trystero.art.com one suggestion in your .xdefaults .xresources file try put only the minimum number of resource that you want to have available to all of your application for example *reversevideo true then separate your resource into individual client-specific resource file for example home/lib/app-defaults in your .login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home/lib/app-defaults/ n the `` comp.windows.x frequently ask question '' faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variable work -- ed so when xterm launch it load it resource from ... /app-defaults/xterm xdvi find them in ... /app-defaults/xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all client follow the same xxxxx resource-file name pattern you can check in your system app-defaults directory often /usr/x11r5/lib/x11/app-defaults/ to find the proper name and then name your personal resource file with the same name this be all document in the xt specification pg 125 666 thanks to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc.com michael urban urban cobra.jpl.nasa.gov and mike long mikel ee.cornell.edu kevin be willing mail his setup file to inquirer this method of organize your personal resource have the follow benefit easy to maintain more usable few resource be store in the x server in the resource_manager property a a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resource application only process their own resource never have to sort through all of your resource to find the one that affect them it also have drawback the application that you be interested in have to load an additional file every time it start up this do n't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability if you be modify an application 's resource database you just need to re-run the application without have to `` xrdb '' again xrdb will by default run your .xdefaults file through cpp when your resource be split out into multiple resource file and then load by the individual client program they will not watch out for this i have c style comment in my .xdefaults file which cpp strip out when i switch to this method of distribute resource file i spent several frustrate day try to figure out why my client be not find their resource xt do *not* provide any error message when it encounter the c style comment in the resource file it simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e.g `` ifdef color '' ... be enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management you may also run into some client which break the rule for example neither emacs 18.58.3 nor xvt 1.0 will find their resource if they be anywhere other than in .xdefaults when start up a client on a machine that do not share file with the machine where your resource be store your client will not find it resource load all your resource into the server will guarantee that all of your client will always find their resource casey leedom casey gauss.llnl.gov a possible compromise suggestion that i have and be planning on try be to put resource for all my heavily use client eg xterm into my .xdefaults file and to use the `` separate resource file '' method for client that i seldom use define your display properly client program be often execute on the same machine a the server in that situation rather than set your display environment variable to `` hostname :0.0 '' where hostname be the name of your workstation you should set your display variable to `` unix:0.0 '' or `` :0.0 '' by do this you access optimize routine that know that the server be on the same machine and use a share memory method of transfer request thanks to patrick j horgan pjh70 ras.amdahl.com see the _display names_ section of the x 1 man page for far explanation of how to properly set your display name `` i do n't think it 's stock mit but at least data general and hp

ram then you should think carefully about the number of program you be run think also about the _kind_ of program you be run for example be there a small clock program than xclock unfortunately i have n't really notice that program advertise how large they be so the onus be on u to do the research and spread the word suggestion on well alternative to the some of the standard client eg xclock xterm xbiff be welcome -- ed i 've receive some contradictory advice from people on the subject of x client program some advocate the use of program that be strictly xlib base since xt xaw and other toolkits be rather large others warn u that other application which you be use may have already load up one or more of these share library in this case use a non-xt for example client program may actually _increase_ the amount of ram consume the upshot of all this seem to be do n't mix toolkits that be try and use just athena client or just xview client or just motif client etc if you use more than one then you 're drag in more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client program would work best together in that environment thanks to rob sartin

update march 1993 i recently have a few email conversation with brian warkentin brian.warkentine eng.sun.com regard xvt he question whether xvt really be at all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scroll speed try this quickie benchmark /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40 and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may be slightly large in ram requirement we do n't have any hard number here do anyone else share library and share text segment mean that xterm 's page requirement be not that major a an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it make little difference since if you never use it it never get brought into memory so here we stand with some conflict report on the validity of xvt over xterm in summary caveat emptor your mileage may vary if you can provide some hard data i 'd like to see it specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each need relative speed of each 2 mterm suggest by der mouse

during data entry into motif text field widget i be get a slight lag in response to some keystroke particularly the initial one in the field examine the what be go on with xscope i found it it seem that when the resource xmnblinkrate be non-zero and the focus be on a text field widget or even just a text widget the i-beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appear or disappears in those widget the widget code be make a request to the server copyarea the user can stop this by set the resource xmnblinkrate to 0. it be not noticeable on a 40mhz sparc but it do make a little difference

application that you 're develop there be ton of thing you can do some that stick out for motif program do n't set xmfontlist resource for individual button label list et al use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget again stick to a few font a possible well yet do n't use motif at all it 's an absolute pig do n't create and destroy widget on the fly try to reuse them this will avoid many problem with buggy toolkits too use a line width of 0 in gc on some server this make a huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose event this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi.uia.ac.be just a small remark i once heard that use a well malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt base application since they use malloc heavily they suggest try out the gnuy malloc but i do n't find the time yet i do some test on small program just do malloc and free and the difference be indeed very noticeable somewhat 5 time faster any confirmation on this from anyone -- ed andre beck andre_beck irs.inf.tu-dresden.de unnecessary noexpose event most people use xcopyarea/xcopyplane a fast blit routine but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the gc use for the blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most case only put load onto the connection and force the client to run through it 's event-loop again and again thousand of xchangegc request this `` gfx context switch '' be also see in most handcoded x-apps where only one or few gc be create and then heavily change again and again xt us a definitely well mechanism by cache and share a lot of gc with all need parameter this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc request

b"extract from the color readme file for anthony 's icon library for network discussion ... color coordination ... i try to start a discussion in comp.windows.x at the start of the year about some sort of standard color table that icon should follow say 16 to 32 color include 5 color for a small grey scale but no one respond at all the problem be that if the color for icon be just use willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstation color table devotes itself solely the window manager icon and other adminstrative task instead of application that actually require the color for proper work `` color needful application '' such a picture and graphic displayers animation real time video raytracers etc ... the follow be a suggest color table for icon and general use icon window manager and general application should follow this table or something like it unless the application be `` color needful '' for each primary color red green blue three color eg value 0 128 and 255. this result in 3 3 color 27 represent most of the standard color for use in icon two extra shade of grey eg vale black 0 64 128 196 and 255 white red ... 3 other color -- probably of some primary color to provide shade a and 3-d look to button and titlebars in the window manager this table represent 32 color and represent a large range of posibilities for the above `` administrative service '' of the workstation anthony thyssen sysprog griffith university anthony cit.gu.edu.au -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a god idea of amusement be a snake ladder game with grease rung terry pratchett `` wyrd sister ''"

xfree86 and where do i get it 3. what be xfree86 xfree86 be an enhance version of x386 1.2 which be distribute with x11r5 this release consists of many bug fix speed improvement and other enhancement here be the highlight of the enhancement 1 the speedup package from glenn lai be an integral part of xfree86 selectable at run-time via the xconfig file some speedup require an et4000 base svga and others require a virtual screen width of 1024. the speedup suitable to the configuration be select by default with a high-quality et4000 board vram this can yield up to 40 improvement of the xstones benchmark over x386 1.2 2 the fx386 package from jim tsillas be include a the default operating mode if speedup be not select this mode be now equivalent in performance to x386 1.1b x11r4 and approximately 20 faster than x386 1.2 3 support for localconn compile-time selectable for server client or both this support be for both svr3.2 and svr4 for svr4.0.4 with the 'advanced compatibility package local connection from sco xsight/odt client be support 4 driver for ati and trident tvga8900c and tvga9000 svga chipsets refer to the file readme.ati and readme.trident for detail about the ati and trident driver 5 support for compress bitmap font have be add thomas eberhardt's code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu 6 type1 font code from mit contrib tape have be include and be compile-time selectable there be contribute type1 font in the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu 7 new configuration method which allows the server 's driver and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distribution 8 integrate support for 386bsd mach and linux 9 a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga card be now include the follow key feature be add with the release of xfree86 1.2 they be not in xfree86 1.1 1 the monochrome server have be enhance to do bank-switching of available svga memory to allow virtual screen up to 1600x1200 see the x386 1 manual page for more information 2 support for the hercules mono card have be add to the monochrome server and with it the ability to support a `` two head '' server one vga and one hercules so far this have only be test on svr4 it be also report to work under linux 3 svr3 share library test under isc svr3 2.2 and 3.0.1 4 support for svr4.2 there be some special consideration to consider due to new usl bug see the readme.svr4 file for more information 5 support for ps/2 mouse and logitech mouseman/trackman some version of these device be not previously compatible 6 a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data write by eric raymond derive from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation 7 greatly improve support for international keyboard include implementation of the compose key functionality found on many vendor server see the x386keybd 1 manual page for more information 8 the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clock have be improve and the timing be now store at accuracy of 0.1 mhz user may want to consider remove an exist clock line from their xconfig file and re-probing use the new server 9 many enhancement in error handle and parse of the xconfig configuration file error message be much more informative and intuitive and more validation be do there be many new option that can be enable in the xconfig file see the x386 1 manual page for more information on the format of this file plus a number of other small thing refer to the changelog file in the source distribution for full detail also include be a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond and the current x386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by david wexelblat 4. what os be support xfree86 support svr4.2 consensys v4.2 svr4.0 microport dell esix isc at t mst consensys uhc svr3 isc 2.2 3.0 at t 2.2 linux mach 386 386bsd 0.1 bsd/386 be not support but it should work the most active bsd/386 person be greg lehey grog lemis.de note that esix 3.2d and sco be not support yet but anyone should feel free to submit patch if you be interested in tackle this send mail to xfree86 physics.su.oz.au 5. what video hardware be support at this time xfree86 1.2 support the follow svga chipsets tseng et4000 tseng et3000 paradise pvga1 western digital wd90c00 wd90c10 wd90c11 these be supersets of the pvga1 and use it driver genoa gvga trident tvga8900c tvga9000 ati 18800 28800 all of the above be support in both 256 color and monochrome mode with the exception of the ati chipsets which be only support in 256 color mode the monochrome server also support generic vga card use 64k of video memory in a single bank and the hercules card on the et3000 only 64k of video memory be support for the monochrome server and the gvga have not be test with more than 64k it appear that some of the svga card manufacturer be go to non-traditional mechanism for select pixel-clock frequency to avoid have to modify the server to accommodate these scheme xfree86 1.2 add support for use an external program to select the pixel clock this allows program to be write a new mechanism be discover refer to the readme.clkprog file for information on how these program work if you need to write one if you do develop such a program the xfree86 team would be interested in include it with future xfree86 release if you be purchasing new hardware for the purpose of use xfree86 it be suggest that you purchase an et4000-based board such a the orchid prodesigner ii avoid recent diamond board xfree86 will not work with them because diamond wo n't provide program detail in fact the xfree86 project be actively not support new diamond product a long a such policy remain in effect contribution of code will not be accepted because of the potential liability if you would like to see this change tell diamond about it some people have ask if xfree86 would work with local bus or eisa video card theoretically the mean of communication between the cpu and the video card be irrelevant to xfree86 compatibility it could be isa eisa or local bus what should matter be the chipset on the video card unfortunately the developer do n't have a lot of access to eisa or vlb machine so this be largely an untested theory however we have yet to see any report of thing not work on one of these bus and we have several report of xfree86 work fine on them 6. what about accelerate board at this time there be no support in xfree86 for accelerate board like the s3 ati ultra 8514/a tiga etc this support be available in commercial product from sgcs and metrolink for svr3 and svr4 an s3 server be available for 386bsd and linux contact hasty netcom.com for 386bsd or jon robots.ox.ac.uk for linux a beta 8514/a server be available for linux contact martin cs.unc.edu or jon robots.ox.ac.uk note these server be not part of xfree86 7. why do n't xfree86 support 16-color vga mode the reason that this be not support be the way vga implement the 16-color mode in 256-color mode each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel but the 16-color mode be implement a bit- plane each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixel and there be four such plane the mit frame- buffer code be not design to deal with this if vga handle 16-color mode by pack 2 4-bit pixel into each byte the mit code could be modify to support this or it already may i 'm not sure but for the vga way of do thing a complete new frame-buffer implementation be require some beta tester be look into this but nothing be yet available from the project 8. what other hardware or software requirement be there obviously a support svga board and o be require to run x efficiently 12-16mb of memory should be consider a minimum the various binary release take 10-40mb of disk space depend on the o e.g whether or not it support share library to build from source at least 80mb of free disk space will be require although 120mb should be consider a comfortable low bound 9. where can i get source for xfree86 source patch for the current version 1.2 base on x11r5 pl22 from mit be available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu under /contrib/xfree86 ftp.physics.su.oz.au under /xfree86 ftp.win.tue.nl under /pub/xfree86 for the rest of this faq these 3 location will be call ftp refer to the readme file under the specify directory for information on which file you need to get to build your distribution 10. where can i get binary for xfree86 binary be available via anonymous ftp from

binary distribution will contain a readme file that describes what file you need to take from the archive and which compile-time option selection be make when building the distribution iv what general thing should i know about run xfree86 11. installation directory the top-level installation directory be specify by the projectroot /usr/x386 by default variable in config/site.def binary include file and library be instal in projectroot/ bin include lib this can be change when rebuild from source and can be modify via symbolic link for those os that support them this directory be nonstandard and be chosen this way to allow xfree86 to be instal alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied x implementation 12. configuration file the xfree86 server read a configuration file `` xconfig '' on startup the search path content and syntax for this file be document in the server manpage which should be consult before ask question 13. determine vga dot clock and monitor mode david e wexelblat dwex mtgzfs3.att.com maintains a database of know clock setting for vga card and monitor setting the database be instal in /usr/x386/lib/x11/etc/modedb.txt and be in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc this database be also available from him for the late copy and be kept on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/x386.modedb.z which be update occasionally obtain a copy of this database it just might have the setting you need if you create new setting please send them to david for inclusion in the database if this do n't help you the videomodes.doc by eric raymond file with xfree86 contains tutorial on how to come up with these timing it may be helpful to start with setting that almost work and use this description to get them right when you do send the information to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database note the old 'clock.exe program be not support any more and be completely unnecessary if you need to determine dot clock value for a new board remove the 'clocks line from your xconfig file if present and start the server the server will probe for clock itself and print them out you can use these value to put a 'clocks line into your xconfig file which be not necessary but will speed up start the server in the future 14. rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit if you have instal the server binary link kit it be possible to reconfigure the driver and font renderers in the server this be fully explain in the readme file that be available with the link kit v what os-specific thing should i know about run xfree86 first of all the server must be instal suid-root mode 4755 15. svr4 why wo n't my xterm run properly if your kernel be not built with the consem module you should define consem=no in you environment otherwise xterm wo n't run csh user should use 'setenv consem no' the esix console driver patch 403019 be know to cause keymapping problem with xfree86 it recommend that this patch not be instal alternatively they keymap can be fix with xmodmap 16. svr3 make sure you look at ftp/readme.isc if that 's what you be run 17 386bsd make sure you look at ftp/readme.386bsd also a separate 386bsd faq be maintain by richard murphey rich rice.edu the late version should be available in the file xfree86-1.2-386bsd-faq at the follow ftp site agate.berkeley.edu /pub/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfree86-1.2 wuarchive.wustl.edu /mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfree86-1.2 grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr pub/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfree86-1.2 18. linux you must be run linux 0.97pl4 or great and have the 4.1 gcc jump library instal make sure the binary x386 x386mono xload and xterm be setuid root if your kernel do n't have tcp support compile in you 'll have to run the server a `` x -pn '' the default startup configuration assumes that tcp be

major number 4 minor number 0. also note that if /dev/console be not own by the user run x then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection xdm will properly change the owner but startx wo n't when run xdm from rc.local you will need to provide it with a tty for example `` xdm /dev/console '' for more detailed information please read the file readme present with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu 19. mach make sure you look at ftp/readme.mach vi what thing should i know for building xfree86 from source this section have be remove from the faq since it be fully explain in ftp/readme and the os-specific readmes please look at those file for information on building xfree86 vii be there anything special about building client with xfree86 20. bsd compatibility library a lot of client make use of bsd function like bcopy etc the default configuration file be set up to link with libxbsd.a which contains emulation for bcopy bzero bcmp ffs random seed a well way of provide the b function be to include x11/xfuncs.h in source file that call them xfuncs.h provide macro definition for these in term of the sysv 'mem function if you be link with a vendor supply library which call some of these function then you should link with libxbsd.a 21. ansiccoptions this be something that be add to allow a developer to get rid of the ansi-ness define in the default ccoptions without have to rewrite the entire ccoptions line for example with stock mit you 'd see something like ccoptions= '' -ansi -o2 -fwritable-strings '' and to get rid of the ansi-ness the developer would have to put ccoptions= '' -o2 -fwritable-strings '' in his imakefile with this change you would see a default of ansiccoptions= '' -ansi '' ccoptions= '' -o2 -fwritable-strings '' and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile be ansiccoptions= to get rid of the ansi-ness many x client will die a horrible death with -ansi the effect be even more dramatic in practice because ccoptions be actually quite complex the other issue be that one must add 'ansiccoptions= ansiccoptions to a passcdebugflags definition xfree86 contact information ongoing development planning

framework for the c++ language built upon x11 and the x-toolkit it be design to be a simple and intuitive program interface to access the functionality of commonly use widget xm++ be initially create for the motif widget set now support for the athena widget be add application create with xm++ run in both environment without change although many nice feature be only available when use motif in some situation xm++ extends the underlie toolkit i.e provide a combobox borrow from ms-windows but never try to replace it data of user interface object be left to the widget and only duplicate in rare case xm++ have nothing common with motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate motif widget in c++ object and the '++ in it 's name many idea for the xm++ architecture come from digitalk 's smalltalk version which provide an easy to use framework for windows/pm/mac application in the very first time of development i use the window dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm++ dialog top level object in xm++ 'windows 'systemdialogs and 'toolboxes which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widget in motif and xaw 'userdialogs which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder a first version of such a dialog editor be include in this distribution control child of top level object 'statictext 'staticimage 'pushbutton 'checkbox 'radiobutton 'edit 'listbox 'combobox 'groupbox 'panearea 'drawing 'toolbar' the staticimage and all the button class can display b/w x-bitmap format or color gif format picture a an alternative to a label text event handle be do by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects xt callback to member function of xm++ object commoninteract ii be built upon the xm++ draw class and provide component for building direct manipulative application be be a very simplify implementation of some feature from the commoninteract system research project of our institute in 1991 an approach to define a software achitecture for implement direct manipulative application with multiple interaction medium i.e sound alternative input device if you be interrested look into the june 1993 issue of the joop sigs publication journal of object orient program there should be our paper about commoninteract but be aware that it be our 'state of the art from 1991 commoninteract ii be still undocumented and be include because it be use to implement the dialog editor it currently support only draw primitive line rectangle circle ... but we plan to extend it to support bitmap and some control also know problem the xm++ draw class have no redrawing strategy always redraws the whole window even after minimal change like select an object this look very ugly on slow display and should be fix about this first release xm++ be still incomplete and have a lot of bug but we be use it here for small application which be run without problem so i think i can call it a 'beta release which can be use to develop application for any non-critical purpose commoninteract may be call a 'pre alpha release it 's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seem to be stable and can be use for experimental application platform this release be compile and test on hp9000/720 run
