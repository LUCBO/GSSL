several straight forward step the header need to be create and then write to the file these header structure be define in the m windows/3.0 `` windows.h '' include file palette information need to be

the file a a dib image file on an intel byte order machine ibm or a compatible this constant can be form in c a the quantity 'm 8 b == 0x4d42 on an intel system the `` bfsize '' field be the total size of the file for our purpose this field be equal to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entry in the color palette time the size of a rgbquad plus the number of byte of image data if the image data be be write out in an uncompressed form this value can be calculate ahead of time otherwise this field need to be fill in later both the `` bfreserved1 '' and the `` bfreserved2 '' field be always set to zero the `` bfoffbits '' field be set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file for our purpose this field should be set to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entry in the color palette time the size of a rgbquad this work out because the image data be write write after the color palette if one exists march 15 1991 6 the bitmapinfoheader this structure be define in `` windows.h '' a typedef struct tagbitmapinfoheader dword bisize dword biwidth dword biheight word biplane word bibitcount dword bicompression dword bisizeimage dword bixpelspermeter dword biypelspermeter dword biclrused dword biclrimportant bitmapinfoheader the `` bisize '' field be set to the size of the bitmapinfoheader structure itself when reading the image file this value be what be use to determine that the image contains a bitmapinfoheader and not a bitmapcoreheader the `` biwidth '' field be the width of the image in image pixel the `` biheight '' field be the height of the image in image line the `` biplane '' field should always be set to 1. this data be write out a if there be one color plane the `` bibitcount '' field be the bit-depth of the image this must be either 1 4 8 or 24 depend on the bit-depth of the image data the `` bicompression '' field tell how the image data be compress if it be compress dib image support two form of run-length encode however i have never see any image which use it and know yet how it work set this field to zero long zero or 0l to indicate that the data be not compress all subsequent field of the bitmapinfoheader structure may be set to zero a requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to compute these field a necessary from the previous information the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be `` biclrused '' for 4-bit and 8-bit image this field indicates that not all of the possible color entry be use and that the image contains `` biclrused '' color if you be use only 32 color with an 8-bit image then you may only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entry generally set this field to zero march 15 1991 7 color palette each entry of a color palette be a rgbquad structure the rgbquad structure be define in the `` windows.h '' include file a typedef struct tagrgbquad byte rgbblue byte rgbgreen byte rgbred byte rgbreserved rgbquad the `` rgbreserved '' field be always zero for each color use the amount of blue green and red be fill into the structure and the structure be write to the file a value of zero in the `` rgbblue '' `` rgbgreen '' or `` rgbred '' field indicates that that particular component do not contribute to the color composition a value of 255 in any of these field indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition image data there be three surprise about the order of image data in dib image file the creator of this format be determine to be creative and certainly be within the image data each line write out be pad to the next four byte quantity so if you have an 8-bit image which be only one pixel wide you still have to write out four byte for every image line the number of byte per line can be calculate a bytes_per_line width_in_pix bit_depth 31 32 4 -- -or in term of the field of the bitmapinfoheader structure -- bytes_per_line biwidth bibitcount 31 32 4 when write out your image data you must write it out bottom line first the bottom line of the image a you would look at it on the screen be the first line of image data in the file for 1-bit 4-bit and 8-bit image information be write a you would expect one bit image be pad eight pixel to a byte four bit image be pad two pixel to a byte eight bit image be write one pixel per byte twenty-four bit image be write three byte per pixel however for 24-bit image the information must be write out in the order blue green red while most image file format write data out in march 15 1991 8 an `` rgb '' order a dib image file writes the data out in an `` bgr '' order summary this should provide enough information to create dib image from application such a scanner or for image export routine if you find out any more about dib image please pas the information on to me so that i can modify this document accordingly march 15 1991 --

b"om cliff do you know the difference between `` window '' and `` win-os/2 '' here's a helpful hint run `` window '' under os/2 2.0 be only possible in real mode in a do box of course this be only possible with window 3.0 since window 3.1 no longer have a `` real mode '' the ability to run standard mode the ability to have an os/2 window clipboard the ability to run seamless and a few other thing be all add by ibm to `` win-os/2 '' now everybody who be run `` window '' in real-mode in a do box under os/2 2.x raise your hand finally everybody who be run `` win-os/2 '' under os/2 raise your hand get the picture cliff"
b"i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install window from a novell administrator 's point of view i just get off the phone with m access support and be told that they microsoft have decide to implement a a standard for software support the local setup described below a the `` most advantageous installation '' if this be true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but like to hear it from administrator first the local window installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ window be fully instal on each workstation hard drive assume the resource be available from a network administrator 's implementation he/she would install all window disk on a network drive use setup/a then install window on a per/machine base by run setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drive in this way all driver be available to the setup procedure w/o the need to change disk advantage reduce traffic run window locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main window file network independence if the network fails and they all do at one point or another the local installation would allow user to keep produce and reduce the cost of down-time faster window theoretically window will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network this may be a hard point to prove if the network have an optical backbone and/or the network drive be significantly faster access than local one a user travel from machine to machine do not need to worry about vary setup monochrome color type of mouse etc ... since the window installation be assign to the workstation disadvantage cost instal window locally require a significant amount of disk space workstation now must be purchase with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent administration local window installation be very difficult to administer new driver for peripheral be constantly be make available each of which would have to be individually instal on each workstation security user now have access to erase or corrupt their own system file from simple ignorance this could result in quite a headache for administrator who may have to constantly repair damage installation backup we all know the problem backing up local hard disk the backup set if do via a centralize tape system get very large very quickly backup individually to floppy may not happen at all this may be eliminate if it be assume that local hard disk only contain replaceable application and *not* user data the share window installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ window be fully instal to a network disk via the setup/a procedure described above user or administrator then install a minimal set of file to individual `` user '' directory these directory may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network `` home '' directory the bulk of the window system file be maintain on the network in a single directory some 400+ file and be access share as-needed by user throughout their window session the user 's file consist of a small set of file that the user have update during his/her window session these include group file .ini file and other regularly update file advantage a single location for all file make update to drive easy a an update driver becomes available it only need to be instal in this single directory for all user to be able to take advantage of it assume that the user file be maintain in network home directory the administrator can easily edit any .ini file as-needed to correct problem that may arise this include win.ini and system.ini backup of all pertinent file be do easily even if the user file be on a local hard disk the bulk of the window system be back up with all driver update disadvantage network traffic since all window file be be share in a network directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of window if the network crash all production come to a stop since window's be reliant upon the network for it file loss of data usually occurs a well since user work in window at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work although minimal disk space be still a consideration if the user file be maintain on the network a large number of user can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal window file alone user can not easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware be similar this be due to the window installation be tie to a particular username in the case of network user file the discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i would like to know from other administrator with a large window userbase how they prefer set up window personally i have setup numerous installation use the share setup all window and application file be on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disk in fact i sell a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disk for their workstation and thus save that much more money i would also like to see recommendation for application should apps such a word and/or excel be instal locally regardless of how window be instal again i keep all file on the network for easy backup and administration but this be `` put all egg in one basket '' if the network crash work come to a halt"

of do 6 a an upgrade distribution -- it be a long story but would make good reading for those who be interested in know the potential pitfall of `` upgrade '' to do 6 that i have be able to notice after only about a week of play around with it my envorinment ============== ti travelmate 4000 winsx 486sx/25 4m ram 120m disk system bios version 1.03 05/21/92 by texas instrument cl-gd6420 vga bios

zd lab after `` updgrading '' to do 6 i could not understand why certain thing become so slow especially after i decide to try 'dblspace in the process of find out why i discover some interest thing disk performance with double space and smart drive ================================================== while most thing do not appear to slow down most of the time certain application appear to run very much slow what be interest be that command like 'chkdsk and 'defrag be run far too slowly to consider them useful by any standard i suspect double space d and decide to measure it impact on my system use winbench tm the real disk winmark of 20350 for the original system a ship from factory with do 5 and windowws 3.1 become 10718 when `` upgraded '' to do 6 with d thus there be an effective performance degradation of more than 50 percent which do not really surprise me because i knew that d compression must cost something specifically for short sequential read up to 512 byte d actually *improves* transfer rate by about 10 because cpu be faster than i/o more cpu cycle need for d be more than compensate by saving in i/o cycle however for all other case particularly large random writes the transfer take up to three time a long while the performance depends on the type of access i.e random or sequential small or large transfer unit on the average base on winbench 's assumption the disk slows down to half it speed the test alone do in 'real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it help to put into those subjective statement like 'there be no noticable difference in performance or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk i/o this explain why some application ran markedly slow but not why 'chkdsk and 'defrag the latter especially too so long double space and window ======================== dblspace will not run at all from within window not even if you want to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on it usage -- try `` fasthelp dblspace '' in a do box within window and you will see what i mean from the error message you get how narrow mind can a programer get i wonder yes this information can be obtain through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager but this 'mstools dll do not understand a compress floppy use the do 6 supplement utility to create a compress floppy if you dont know how to do 6 defragmenter be incompatible with ti apm ============================================== defragmentation seem to take too much time even so i wait patiently till it finish and then ran it again to just to confirm this confirmation 'dblspace /def command for the 120m drive should take no more than 30 second much faster on other defragmenters i have use but it take 12 minute i discover that if i move the mouse defragmentation check ran faster the figure ticked more rapidly it dawn on me that this have to do with ti 's battery saver advanced power management apm module which slows the clock down when it think that the cpu be idle and it obviously thought d defragmentation be an idle process after disable the ti 's power saver this operation take only 20 second microsft programmer think ti4000 and gateway nomad user be idiot ==================================================================== in the readme.txt file you can find the the

found out not only do ti 's power management interfere with microsoft backup a the readme.txt claim but 'chkdsk and 'dblspace and who know what else be cripple by the ti 's power saver it be obvious that there be not such thing a apm specification if there indeed be such a thing then either microsoft programmer or ti programmer dont know how to read these specification you dont have to guess a to

be the steady state value on my notebook when i be run nothing window with only program manager in iconised form do that mean that window take up 40 of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only 60 left for useful work be such an overhead justified whether or not window be an operating system or just another user interface in do alone it report 99 idle time look like window be a good example of busy wait type of package that i like my student to study a the classical 'negative' example of our time microsoft programmer do not know batch program =================================================== i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statement like this set path=c \\dos ... set path=c \\etc\\bin path c \\bin ... set path=c \\etc\\windows path c \\windows ... set path= path c \\bcc\\bin ... set path= path mouse even though the new do be instal in the same directory a the old one i.e c \\dos do 6 installation program modifes each and every path statement and prepends c \\dos to it value a a result my resultant path have so many do 's if the installation program want to remove the old do path and add the new do path clearly it have to only scan for the path statement containg the old do directory and replace it by the new do path even this should only be do if the new do be instal in a directory different from the old one be 'upgraded instead the microsoft programmer if you can call this person one decide to meddle every path statement i have in the autoexec and prepend do to the value i wonder if microsoft be so desparate that it would not fire programmer who be incapable of the thought process i start a thread on this when do 4 come up and the microsoft representative in singapore call me about this poster in fact he specifically say his u counterpart saw the poster and relayed the information to him a he do not have access to internet now that have not change one bit in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it be it not obvious that the this statement should not be touch for any reason a another example of the inability of microsoft programmer to understand batch program -- i have the mouse driver invoked a set mouse=c \\etc\\mouse set path= path mouse loadhigh mouse \\mouse.com guess what memmaker do it replace the last statement with lh ... c \\etc\\mouse\\mouse.com why be it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and it parameter without touch the rest of the line i do not understand do 6 software quality ====================== do 6 be the only operating system i know in which under normal usage you end up create a file that you can not get rid of use of the command that come with it i be deliberately be cryptic about this i challenge microsoft to use all it programmer to catch this bug and publish it if they dont within a week i will post how you can create this `` ghost '' file surely if i can pick this bug without even look for it after use a particular command only twice i be sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmer randomly banging on their keyboard over a week could find it -- that be what i be told how microsoft `` test the quality '' of their product i think it be funny that microsoft have found way to `` test quality '' when it be accepted in the industry that quality can not be test but can only be built into the product no wonder they can not provide any form of guarantee on their product not even a decent list of bug that will prevent score of user from destroy their disk beyond repair also

version we have revise cosy_pak to take advantage of the more robust signal processing function available in mathematica v2.1 since mathematica 2.1 provide a well and work laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function than mathematica v2.0 do we adopt them this have make cosy_pak small thus brian evans signal processing package that support the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function in the cosy_pak v0.81 be no longer need directly by cosy_pak v0.9 for power user who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evans package on signal processing available at the anonymous ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu or ip 130.207.226.24 on the downside the disadvantage of this update can be that mathematica 2.1 require more runtime resource than it previous version *********************************************************************** -- for mathematica 2.0 user we have include the laplacetransform package from mathematica 2.1 in the directory for_2.0 please move all file and directory under for_2.0 into the calculus directory under mathematica package directory

b"i have be use the join command for many year now mostly with good success in duplicate unix-style file mount you will hear lot of people curse join because they confuse it with the do append command a truely gnarly hack but believe them you also will hear people say that microsoft recommends that you not use join but in microsoft 's window 4 workgroups resource toolkit the follow appear `` join an ms-dos utility work fine with window for workgroups 3.1 if you do not change the state of the join drive during a window for workgroups 3.1 session this include add or remove join drive from within window for workgroups we recommend that you do not use join when run window setup or window for workgroups 3.1 '' within this caveat join appear to be valid under window however i have found a couple of application that deal well with filesystems that have be `` mount '' use join in particular the bad offender be word for window 2.0x it get very confuse when you edit and then try to save a file on a join drive it want to create the save file a ~nnnnn.tmp in the current dir then delete the old file and rename the ~nnnnn.tmp file to the *.doc file unfortunately wfw usually writes the ~nnnnn.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory often in the root dir of the join filesystem but not always then after delete the original *.doc file it find the ~nnnnn.tmp file to rename it unless you search your disk system the document be go i have also found subtle problem use the mks toolkit from a do box when join filesystems be present i use to join c \\temp with a 4meg ramdisk but mks sometimes get confuse when do an `` l '' on the c \\temp dir and miss some file in the temp dir this be difficult to reproduce but it go away totally when join be not use i think this be a window problem rather than mks 's since it work ok under raw do so i would suggest that you can use join but be aware that it may not be a robust you would like it be real great to `` mount '' network drive i.e z under the main file tree rather than have all those darn drive letter unfortunately join let you do it there be talk on the net about a simple patch to let join work on network drive but i remember the source too bad the join command be not well implement since it would avoid use all those stupid drive letter i realize that messdos be meant for casual even ignorant user so `` mount '' all the drive in one file tree might be confuse but it look like m be go to carry this over into window nt another o meant for casual even igorant user -- not with all old family system baggage maybe m need a recovery group so they can get on with life"

b"hello again about a week and one-half ago i post a query look for people feeling on the inkjet family of printer specifically a comparison between the canon bj200 bubblejet and the hewlett-packard deskjet 500. many people ask me to post the summary/account of all the posting and e-mail i receive below be my original query and the response i receive i have not delete any part of the response only the header and signature so you can extract what you find necessary some people ask me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and bias comment you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer there be a wide range of comment each have it own value there be no clear winner some like the bj200 especially it price/performance ratio others prefer the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven driver and a solid background two new inkjet printer have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduce by hewlett-packard later this year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet you will find that after the initial purchase the cost of re-filling or replace the ink cartridge be about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacement -- so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer no one mention approx how many sheet each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they be roughly equal at about 1000 1500 sheet laser printer will do 4000-5000 sheet per toner cartridge well a brief research summary of my personal research enjoy =========================================================================== well i bought the bj 200 about a month ago at the start of their 50 rebate program on that printer it end 5/31 and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of 325 be beat anywhere i look and i think a hot printer just use regular copier paper produce fantastic result just in high quality mode i compare the output of a micrografx designer legal size draw with 4pt type do on my bj 200 with the same draw print on an hp laserjet iid and i be amaze how well i could read the small print on the bj 200. printing speed be several second faster on the bj 200 which be amaze consider that the hp have 2.5m ram instal i measure the time from when the printer first indicate it be receive data a i use print manager in window i show the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineer place their order too if you need cdw 's phone number 800-598-4239. delivery to ny be two day good luck craig witkowski ceng51 maccvm.corp.mot.com motorola communication electronics inc. glen rock nj =========================================================================== i own a deskjet 500. performance spectacular under window use truetype font but neither be the canon from what i have see quality for the hp be very much dependent on paper quality on 'standard photo-copy paper the character have slightly 'frayed edge but on well quality 'distinction type paper thing look well for most application i find copy paper fine still well than dot-matrix come with a window driver which seem to by-pass print manager have a few 'intelli-fonts'which be hp scaleable font probably faster than truetype but really try them out can get ram font cartridge but unless the speed of truetype be a problem i bother the ram cartridge be use a buffer soft font only for graphic i.e bmp image etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supply win driver there a number of dither option such a 'scatter 'pattern etc the manual give recommendation depend on the type of image be print text be not so good in this mode problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text the range of tone for graphic image brilliant but i think that be more of a limitation with inkjet printer in general however a printer definitely worth look at be the new inkjet from epson this printer be faster cheaper and capable of produce laser-like quality on normal copier paper remember the model lx something i think i purchase my hp day before the epson be release here the introductory price on the epson be the same a the hp here in new zealand =========================================================================== about a month ago i get a canon bj200 i absolutely love it it be incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i know if you ever do stuff with that or not most of the stuff i print be either from microsoft word for window or just plain text the only problem have be printing headers/footers the printer freak out and printing on cheap paper lot of streak normal copy paper work great with it you can only tell not laser-printed by hold it oh less than twelve inch from your face that be if nearsighted like me the printer come with it own driver for window 3.1 i have no other complaint the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software package that write a driver for it yet the teeny-weeny footprint be a real plus too -- and if you purchase it between now and may 31 you get a 50 rebate from canon i bought mine from a store call compusa and the price now be 340 i have a friend who have the hp you be look at it also print very well and everyone have driver for it but it be very slow hope i help 360dpi sure look great heather stehman =========================================================================== i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj-300 at work and a deskjet 500 at home i prefer the deskjet the printing speed and quality be similar i test both with text and graphic before buying the deskjet for home the feature that set the deskjet apart be the driver support in so many application the bj end up emulate the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be the case for a long time the design be superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet be quieter and the ink cartridge be quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs just my 0.02 worth.. -- mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto p.o box 174 luling la 70070 internet address dmmatt bigez.monsanto.com =========================================================================== yes there be the landscape mode printing problem but it do not present a problem in window a the window printer driver handle the translation i actually thought of some other point after i post the note the deskjet have an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around the paper the bubblejet do not you be right about the graphic resolution i test the printer with the application i have access to wordperfect harvard graphic wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference in fact one of the hp deskjet window driver give you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence control the amount of ink you put down the bubblejet do not i have no image software to test the printer with and so have no comparision there finally i want sheet feed in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately 100 more than the deskjet i go through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money btw i be replace the bj-300 with a deskjet 500 at work this month anyway regard mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la =========================================================================== i spent some time compare the two we end up get the bubblejet bj-200 versus the hp our reason be 1 the hp seem to have bad banding than the canon 2 360dpi versus 300 we felt we could see the difference 3 price canon have a 50 rebate program go on at the moment the bj-200 be our choice over the bj-10ex we could have 100 page in the bj-200 feeder the bj-10ex hold only 30 page i think a you can see up to 100 page on the bj-200 we do anything big with the bj but it performance seem reasonable under window i know that the microsoft bb have a newer window driver than come with the printer but i know how it compare also the driver include with the printer be canon 's whereas i know where the microsoft bb one come from microsoft hope this help -- thomas v. frauenhofer wa2yyw tvf cci.com ... uunet uupsi cci632 tvf tvf cs.rit.edu mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself =========================================================================== altough sometimes also a salesperson if not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the bj200 the printing quality be a bit well but you get much more possiblities forget the hp engine be at least 2 year on the marked the canon engine witch be also use in other `` new '' bubblejet printer like e.g the epson one be quite recently available.. see during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printer 2 time the same picture one print with the bj200 one with the canon the other with the hp and.. there be a difference in printing- quality .. the canon be a bit better.. greetz kris =========================================================================== when we decide we need quiet printer in our hospital we look to inkjet printer they have near laser quality speed and they be quiet we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj-200s i prefer the paper handle quality of the deskjets but i feel the canon have superior print quality the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i do end up buying a deskjet for home use get too good a deal anyway we be use canon in high volume area and they be hold up very well out of 15 deskjets and 4 bj-200s i have only have one problem with a deskjet and that be take care of very quickly by hp -nate =========================================================================== whenever i buy anything i look at what the `` expert '' say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criterion be the most apt be unusually flush lately no beg letter please and so do this a few time include about four month ago with inkjet printer i remember much about the process except that i read about three review of inkjets and that the 500 be always at or near the top i bought the 500c because of the add dimension of colour i intend to build a multi- medium machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that although i haven 's use the colour thing in earnest yet i try it out on a couple of window bitmap and i be pleased with the result i note that even though you can now get the 550c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the 500c and 500 be still readily available at least in the uk the follow be my views/experience 1. i know anything about the canon except that i come away from review and reply to a post similar to yours with the idea that the hp offer the best performance/price ratio 2. i believe hp be the original in the field not always the ideal place to be but the market 's still young so one assumes they have the expertise 3. the 500c be worth the extra operation in mono be perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of font from window 4. i use to work for monotype when they still manufacture typesetter before their american owner close them down and i can tell you that in term of definition 300 dpi be pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi be just a bit less poor ... 5. the hp come with a reasonable set of driver 6. if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack pretty slow with it god know what like without i actually work in germany and my pc be home in the uk so not in daily use i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and have a really dumb problem at the start easy peasy to operate hope this be of use regard david =========================================================================== just bought the bj-200 i thought the price be beat 329 with 50 rebate thru 5/31 and so far it be comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality speed per page rate seem to be faster i have figure i print long doc though quality i think the graphic quality be excellent print quality be excellent a well unless you use small font and hold it up close you can see a lot more `` jaggies '' than on a laserjet the 360 dpi be offset by a little less accuracy in hold the page/print head in place i would imagine large doc not room in the standard model for a whole lotta page ... manual say up to 100 though try it driver no problem under win3.1 yet winword want to print the envelope the same way the canon do though know nothing of add-on cost daniel a. hartung -- dhartung chinet.chinet.com -- ask me about rotaract =========================================================================== i just bought a bj-200 printer a couple of day ago i compare it to the sample print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp for me the bj-200 be pretty fast and really print with good quality i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical depend on the kind of paper i have problem with the ink not be dry it seem to dry very fast probably within a second since canon be give a 50 rebate until the end of may it be really a good buy -- sean eckton computer support representative college of fine art and communication =========================================================================== wow funny you should ask this a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late i just purchase the canon bubblejet last night i be really worried that i like it but the print quality and noise level be fantastic i print quite a few document with lot of graphic and it print damn near laser quality you tell not laser unless you get 2 inch from the page no problem with driver the printer come with the driver diskette which be good because i be begin to panic when i findi it under window or wordperfect it work well under both i have yet to install word for window so know how it work with them i have a deskjet 500 at work last year it be a good printer a well ut i felt it be awfully slow and much noisier than the bubblejet i say the bubblejet be much well but i really do like it more just my 0.02 worth -=- brett

b'hmm ... have anyone of u computer geek me include ever consider that inovation be not limited to software/hardware true m product do not boast feature that m invent but how many product out there by other vendor out there be truely innovative in their continue development i think what make m special to the public be thier innovative pricing it be true the xwindows/mac/next all have some feature s in thier gui that be well than ms. but people like me afford them it be true that apple have low their pricing on the low end models.. but they be just that ... low end system 7 be a well operating system but the machine they operate on just be too expensive for my taste ... a unix platform be powerful enuf but tell the common user to set up .xdefault i be still confuse on what some of them thing do and they either puke or faint if u think about it low price aint innovative if u come down to it but for the product it offer and on the low cost and powerful hardware that it run on a compare to mac ... .ms be kinda innovative.. oh yea i guess the fact that the support product and application they have garner for mswindows do make them kinda innovative too..'
