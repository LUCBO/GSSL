b"i need some advice on have someone ride pillion with me on my 750 ninja this will be the the first time take anyone for an extend ride read farther than around the block be rid some twisty fairly bumpy road the mine road-mt.hamilton loop for you sf bay areans unless she be really adventurous do not take her on this route for her first extend ride kinda like take someone on a no-show 10-way speed star competition a their first skydive this person be 100 lb and fairly small so i see weight a too much of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go i want her to hold onto me rather than the grab rail out back and heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction turn so she lean *with* me but what else be there traditional 1 if the ninja have adjustable suspension adjust it to a stiffer set so you bottom out in bumpy curve 2 tell her the 3 cardinal rule be a never ever ever ever put her foot down not when you stop at a stop sign not when she think gon na crash never keep them on the peg until you tell her to get off the bike b she be to hold onto your waist she should hold on tightly enough that she slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit and add bonus for you here she should keep a close to your butt a possible so quick stop make her slide into you and knock your ball up onto the gas tank you decide how best to word this c just stay perpendicular to the bike straight up in the seat lean your body into curve just go with the bike and stay perpendicular look over your shoulder 3 remember at all time that you have a passenger on the back that mean pop the clutch and try to corner and stop smoother than usual be aware that if you jump on the brake go to have the equivalent of a 100 lb dead weight crash into you from behind so be prepared for that 4 make sure she piss before the ride even if she say she have to go no anti-women stuff here i have a tiny bladder myself 5 remind her to look around while rid point to thing of interest it make the ride more enjoyable to her she get so focus on just look at the back of your helmet and it give her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you point at my wife and i try the msf-recommended `` look over the rider's shoulder in curve '' bit and it just work the timing of her weight shift be unpredictable especially on the maxim because unlike the ninja the upright rid position really restricts the pillion 's view of the road ahead next time i have her just remain perpendicular to the bike and i could hardly tell there be someone else on the bike in curve and she weighs substantially over 100 lb"

b"if your distance calc be correct for an `` on the road distance '' and not a the crow fly this be 900km a day for 5 day if you spend the entire time on interstate which would be a total waste of time at least 8 hour on the road every day not include eating/peeing/ sight-seeing etc i be contemplate a similar trip but from ottawa to la or maybe ottawa to austin tx i figure if i wan na do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it have to get my as off the major interstate and spend lot of time enjoy the country around me i.e stop with a camera meeting towns-people go to a few bar no sense spending 2 week look out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas pump i estimate need at least 4-5 week to make the trip worthwhile in question 8 try and stay off the interstate depend on your route and my plan i may be head that way a far a at least detroit call the whithorse pes a book distributer catering to motorcyclist they have a large number of book highlight the best road for motorcyclist along the general route look at they carry listing of bed and breakfast all through the state which accept motorcyclist order their free catalog and within probably find book cover absolutely all you need for this trip their 's in the motorcyclist and/or cycle world classified o.k"

b"cost be low than oem replacement and they weigh less also in most instance you do not have to rejet the carburetor to get a little more performance i replace my oem canister with an ontario system slip on the mid-range performance be well but i also notice a slight stumble at 2-3k rpm after talk to kaz yoshima the developer and manufacturer of the slip on he think i might need large pilot idle jet be not suppose to but maybe where i live make a difference altitude barometric pressure ... anyway besides that minor glitch i like the slip on performance and the sound which be louder than stock but not loud enough to annoy folk the ontario slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full throttle just remember every bike be a tune system when you change the intake or exhaust characteristic beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer you may have to change other area to compensate like a complete change of the exhaust system header and muffler change the exhaust characteristic to the point which re-jetting be require to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping profile talk with the folk who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have use it on your particular bike check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on also a a last data point in sport rider 's first issue do a review on a group of header and exhaust system for the cbr600f2 they also include a a side bar the ontario slip on the dyno show an increase from stock of 5bhp at the rear wheel 85 verse 91. buyer beware of outrageous claimed increase in horse power it may have be true in the past but not today"
