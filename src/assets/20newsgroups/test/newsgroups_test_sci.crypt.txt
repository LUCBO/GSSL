b"i can think of a couple of way of guarantee authenticity in a one-time pad encrytped scheme though not sure how to prove that what kind of authenicity they provide an obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random unpredictable for eve block to the message and then calculate a crc which include the random start block and all of the message this could be encrypt after the message the problem be not sure impossible to come up with a message that will hash to the same crc regardless of the random start block it intuitively seem like it ought to be hard but not *that* sure ... clearly a crypto-strength hash like md5 or the sha would be strong but again not sure comfortable claim that unbreakable a scheme to use up some of the pad bit to decide how many bit of 0's to include in the plaintext stream before go on be too bad either at the cost of increase the speed with which you use up your pad this could be use to give you arbitrarily low probability that your opponent could spoof a valid-looking message since any decipher plaintext in a spot that should be carry 0 's will show that something funny 's go on if for each message bit m_i we use up one random bit r_i to decide whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream get a total pad use of 2.5 time the message length expand the message size by about half each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that be a guess for our would-be spoofer at each bit she have to guess try to see how to quantify her chance of make it all the way through the spoofed message but it get a little complicate because she can get un- synched and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message now i can see a simple way of do this get to be a secure a a one-time pad at a cost of use 4 time the message length in pad bit for each message bit m_i use one random bit r_i and xor them together to get x_i now encrypt the three bit with the one-time pad the enemy have no way of guess what r_i be so he/she guess what x_i be either any change she make in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess of what r_i be be there any way to do this without use so many pad bit spoof the message be equivalent to correctly guess a many random bit a there be bit in the message clearly this make spoof message just a hard if you know the whole message text a if you know none of it in fact it look to me like this make it just a hard to generate a spoofed message with the ciphertext a without it but not entirely sure about that be there an easy way of do this provably a secure a the one-time pad"

b"do not presume to tell me what i have and have not read the system may not rely upon register people a own particular phone unit but it be necessary to know which phone unit be likely to be use for some suspect criminal communication before you can obtain their unit key from escrow this necessity raise the stake in favor of a criminal's coerce or collude use of some other person 's clipper phone i will restate my assumption more explicitly and amplify my argument the original title perhaps should have be `` distinction between legal and illegal cipher system consider harmful '' but `` clipper consider harmful '' be not inaccurate and be more eye-catching in the current context assumption 1. clipper be make available 2. law be pass to make use of cipher system other than clipper illegal either on radio system or on any common carrier system these law also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio spectrum or other medium characterize signal validate clipper wrapper detect probable use of non-clipper cipher and make such detection a cause for far action 3. for escrowed key to be useful some specific clipper chip must be associate with a suspect criminal this mean that at a minimum some association between the common carrier 's unique phone id esn and the clipper chip serial number n will be store in a government database an observe pair of n and esn other than the one record raise a red flag 4. to reduce ordinary fraud the cellphone system which offer clipper will also be construct with an esn mechanism much more tamper-proof and much less spoofable than today 's cellphone 5. criminal want inscrutable communication some criminal be not entirely stupid or ignorant and will figure out both that clipper cellphone offer excellent security in normal circumstance and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a presumably legitimate wiretap order exists they will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone because each one have a unique unit key 6. criminal do not want to call attention to themselves because they be not stupid or ignorant or because they read netnews and because they know that their open use of a non-clipper cipher be likely to be detect they will generally avoid use non-clipper cipher directly on some monitorable/tappable channel they know that do so would raise a red flag put a give cellphone if not a give person under immediate suspicion 7. it be impractical to reverse engineer skipjack discover family key f and construct a functional clone of a clipper chip by 2 3 4 and 7 it will be very difficult to spoof a give clipper phone without immediate detection because it be difficult to obscure one's association to a specific phone by reprogramming or change chip around the criminal will be motivate to find an intact phone which be associate with someone else a non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have clipper-secure communication at least for some limited time t if they buy beg borrow or steal use of someone 's phone in a way that prevents that person from reporting compromise of the phone for at least time t. the encrypt communication might have be record and thus be retrievable later but the criminal can delay and quite likely evade discovery by destroy or abandon the phone before t elapses it would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their clipper phone to someone else the honest subscriber want to pay someone else 's bill and he want to fall under suspicion this leaf two source of clipper phone for criminal use coercion and collusion coercion first theft bear a relatively low risk but also sometimes a low time until detection a few minute if a phone be steal from a car park in front of a store a couple of week if a phone be steal from someone who be away on vacation criminal commerce be likely to arise in steal clipper phone with phone come from risk-inured poor criminal and cash come from risk-averse wealthy criminal someone who be extraordinarily motivate to gain a day or two of undetected communication like a terrorist could kill a person or hold them hostage the limited time before detection that a coerce phone be useful mean that continue criminal enterprise require a continue supply of freshly coerce phone there would also be create a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminal and ignorant or -care patsy who need money and who will submit to be paid in return for subscribe to clipper phone service for someone else 's use criminal will learn that it be more to their advantage to coerce use of a clipper cellphone than it be to apply a non-clipper cipher to a normal cellphone they will call much less attention to themselves or at least to their steal phone this way the fact of a phone 's use be coerce must first be report before it can be identify a an interest phone and have it key obtain from escrow clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super-encryption an automate full-system surveillance mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which know family key f can validate clipper wrapper and n esn association but it can not reveal in realtime the use of super-encryption unless it know all unit key which we be be assure be only to be make available in two separate piece upon specific wiretap-like order whereas a criminal 's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out a criminal 's use of a non-clipper cipher within a clipper medium would be very difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk recording a long a the association between criminal and specific clipper chip be fracture if you make use of this other cipher illegal per se then you can charge the criminal with this if you can identify the true criminal be use someone else 's phone but have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have be planning you will not even be able to detect that unusual encrypt communication be occur until you identify specific phone and obtain their key from escrow the gangster and terrorist be thus arguably more not less secure than they be before clipper come along i therefore consider clipper harmful because 1. it do not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government 2. if other cipher be proscribed it engenders new type of direct criminal threat to the honest public 3. it provide an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminal to hide their use of some other cipher make it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communication be occur and that plan for some criminal act might be in progress 4. if other cipher be proscribed lazy investigator and prosecutor be more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime than they be the traditional and directly harmful crime which key escrow be claimed to help against 5. if other cipher be proscribed the stage be set for witch hunt of `` illegal '' cipher use because any computer can be use a a cipher machine ..."

b"i answer all our question in detail but i can take a stab at them the form the operation that compute r1 r2 and r3 be of course the famous `` triple encryption '' suggest for use with de much strong than a single encryption and have an effective key length of 160 bit for reason that be discuss when de be first standardize a simple double encryption would not have the same strength triple encryption have be use by ibm since more or less the begin to encrypt other key recommend for anything of very high value and i think we can agree that the r_i and s_i fit that description why n_1 n_2 and n_3 well you need different plaintext value i have no idea if be disclose or not at a guess construct so that they differ in a many bit position a possible a goo cryptosystem will scramble thing a lot with even a 1-bit change -- but the value of n in a series will have fairly similar bit pattern and there might conceivably be a weakness so the n_i value be -- and guess -- chosen to increase the ham distance in any event quite convince that one can not go back to the s_i from the u_i let alone u observe if the nsa have u they need to find s_i but even if they do they get u_1 and u_2 in theory they should never even see those value even with a warrant the real question i think be why use this scheme at all a oppose to a hardware random number generator my answer be that this be *much* more verifiable look -- suppose that nsa nist the aclu the eff and the nra combine to build a *really* good random number generator and that it pass every test you could think of when you come back next week to program some more chip do it still work that well have any component change in value have the component be change out from under you do it still work well the in the presence of a focus microwave beam that tends to bias it towards select 1 bit yes you can run detailed statistical test on it again but hard consider on the other hand a software solution you bring your own floppy with you you can run cryptographic checksum etc a lot easy to verify that the software be unchanged in other word yes i can think of way to cheat software too i think that a lot harder there be three issue with clipper the first be whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme be capable of work my answer with one significant exception be yes i really do think that nsa and nist have design this scheme about a well a can be assume that their real objective be a state to permit wiretapping under certain carefully-controlled circumstance with a minimum risk of abuse the exception be that u exists outside of the chip on a program diskette seriously wrong u_1 and u_2 should be load onto the chip separately to those who disagree and i claim my answer be obvious though i found my own reason sufficiently persuasive that i be force to rewrite the conclusion section of my technical analysis paper -- i have originally blast the scheme i issue this invitation assume that you be charge with implement such a system with complete regard for civil right and due process what would you do differently in answer this question please accept nsa 's fundamental assumption that both strong cryptography against outsider and the ability to wiretap *some* domestic user be necessary if you feel it necessary to challenge those assumption do it in the context of the last issue i present below right here discuss *just* the technical aspect and no i by any mean claim that just because something can be do it should be the second issue be whether or not this whole architecture be actually go to be use just because clipper chip be make this way mean that the only way be make maybe the nsa will substitute it own chip between the program facility and the shipping dock and generate bogus warrant request so that the escrow agent wonder why they 've never call `` sorry guy all them terrorist and drug dealer and pedophile seem to have bought triple-des phone instead who 'd a thunk it '' i have no answer to this question and at the moment i see a way of answer it those concern be part of my reason in my answer to the final question below the third and most serious issue be whether or not clipper be a good idea even if carry out strictly accord to the letter of the law i think that the answer be no but not a no-brainer a civil libertarian not a libertarian for reason that i explain at great length on the net in the elder day and that i have the energy to repeat now but that mean that willing to accept that some law be necessary so long a they respect the essential right of individual the government already have the ability and -- in our system -- the right to issue search warrant and while that power have certainly be abuse also be use quite properly and fairly in other case be key escrow sufficiently different i think so -- but again not an easy question for me it be easy for libertarian to answer of course since clipper be completely alien to much of the rest of their oft-admirable philosophy and also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government a group much more distant from"
b"story delete let me give you another story that actually happen to me we sell communication board that use a 68000. they use to be high tech our agent in the uk sell a system to a company in ch which package it in a product for cz london-bern-prague i telexed the brit and told them the swiss need to pas export paperwork through the u a at the time you need an export lisence for these system now i knew the nsa be watch this traffic just like they be watch this traffic and what do you know ... two week later an agent of the u government show up in my office to remind me if we or our agent sell system into the evil empire we have well make sure the export lisences be handle properly he be part of a five man office in columbus ohio who do this stuff base on source he could not reveal i assume most of the time these guy sat around the office with their thumb up their as a there that much stuff come out of columbus wow the electric utility in prague sure be a big worry for these folk the point be we have create a giant bureaucracy nsa with a budget big than the cia 's who like all bureaucracy fill their time look for thing to do the evil empire be go the nsa be not they will do something to fill their time and justify their budget i just wish they too would sit around with their thumb up their as ... but that be too much to hope for ... they will spy on u and do thing like skipjack and subvert people like dorothy denning sigh ..."
b"it be completely clear you have to assume that each byte that be encrypt by this 'clipper chip have be compromise some people wonder why denning hellman and others do not respond when ask what would be do about such compromise phone or if compromise could not be restrict in time i do too let u just assume that a they do not know and b those who know tell and c they do not care it seem 's to be an 'other person 's problem ... gec"

b'i remember see it several month ago and it be marked a a joke funny how thing circulate'
b'use a secret nope obscure cryptographic encode to expand the 30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block the redundancy hereby introduce can be use to detect tamper clipper signal where some public enemy replace the l.e block by random data and of course the l.e block would be use to initialise the encryption of the user data so that at the receive end the correct l.e block must be process in order to have any chance of get the plaintext back for those of you who might want to mangle the l.e block e.g by xor-ing a constant pattern on the transmission line and restore it before feed it into the receive crippler chip i would add far encrypt copy of this block perhaps create by repeat application of the encryption algorithm or so at regular interval during the transmission if the receive chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line be bad and it will cease to work in your own interest you be protect from get faulty plaintext you know -- just like a checksum for your own safety the monitoring agency have the famous black box which be need for actual decryption and will be kept by the fbi but nothing prevents them from use special box which will do the redundancy check for the serial number block and consistency check on the embed l.e block within the transmission these box will turn a red light on a soon a they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol so anyone think that you can use the chip and fool l.e about the tap key -- i bet the developpers have provide much well check than those suggest above of course absolutely crucial that the algorithm and protocol remain secret personally i doubt they will'
b"clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super-encryption an automate full-system surveillance mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which know family key f can validate clipper wrapper and n esn association but it can not reveal in realtime the use of super-encryption unless it know all unit key which we be be assure be only to be make available in two separate piece upon specific wiretap-like order the serial number will be in a 64 bit block with a 34 bit filler take a lot to check to see if that be correct depends on whether the filler be a constant make check easy but susceptible to replay or variable e.g timer counter random which make replay harder and can also make it easy for the inquisitor to know if they 've miss message or gotten them out of sequence or other interest thing that sort of person might care about it be still easy to conceal super-encryption at least until the inquisitor get ahold of the k key which can take a while presumably not in near-real-time worst-case in which the escrow agency provide the u key to the local cop still only get one side of the conversation per warrant unless the same key be use for both direction which i suppose the capstone version of the chip will probably insist on"
b'please be insult but base on this i would say that your encryption algorithm be very likely not worth the paper print on if the nsa give export approval that mean they felt confident that they could crack it -- their job mandate by law and sure they believe in what they do if they give export approval to an encryption algorithm which they confident of be able to crack they would be derelict in their sworn duty to monitor foreign communication for u national security related material just because many most of u think that the government and the spook be pugnacious slimeballs be no reason to lose sight of the fact that they do their job to the best of their ability and far that say ability be rather high i hope that one day we can make them all obsolete ... ... but until then we have to cope with their existence export approval be one thing they do that we can learn a lot from for example'
b'yes there be the patent can be classify a secret i recently saw a patent from 1947 deal with nuclear weapon technology that be only declassify in the last couple of year there be of course the problem of enforce the patent this be absolutely right'

b'firstly an aside i agree that the weakness exists but i have a lot of trouble believe that it represent a difficulty in real life give 1. the purpose of the one-time pad be to give unbreakable security and the expense of key distribution etc. imply that the client really do want that level of security 2. these same people want to keep p a secret i find it hard to believe that eve might happen to have a copy of p lie around i be aware that the same argument applies to eve know even a small part of the message but eve must know exactly where which byte in c her know susequence start or the result will be garble i find this at least a surprising back to the question if i have the resource to use a one-time-pad for such transmission i would also append a message authentication code to the message use up the next bit of the one-time-pad a the key perhaps your original question basically ask whether there be any way to authenticate the message with the same degree of security a the pad itself provide and i know the answer however i would propose the follow for discussion alice and bob have an arbitrary number of secret random bit to share which eve know she find them out effectively by know some p and the correspond c. it be the fact that they correspond that cause the problem if a message authentication code be to be create use some one-time-pad operation such that eve could not know which part of the mac be affected by which part of the input she would be unable to forge a mac to correspond what be require be a non-linear combiner of part of the message non-linear so that simply xoring or subtract or whatever have exactly the same effect now at the end of the encrypt message c alice appends a n-bit mac compute a follow s2 mean the next full chunk of the one time pad 1. compute c2 p xor s2 and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of s 2. break c2 into n-bit chunk 3. set mac to 0 initialisation vector 4. for i in each chunk sequentially set mac mac nlop c2 i at the end of this process mac be the message authentication code bob verifies the mac in the obvious manner he recovers the plaintext p then us some more of his pad to reproduce the mac in the same manner nlop be the non-linear operator and there be the rub the simplest non-linear operator i can think of be an s-box that be have a fix even publish permutation of the n-bit integer an indexable table call sbox and use x nlop y x xor sbox y practically speak i think this solves your problem a eve never see the intermediate output c2 and hence deduce s2 or perform any valid substitution on it also practically speak you want the mac to be fairly large say 32 bit but you might not want a 4 gigabyte say s-box so you might work on 4 byte-sized s-boxes but i think that be an irrelevant detail for the discussion at hand who will be first to point out my error or give me a pointer to some literature'

b"would wiretap chip be cost-effective by robin hanson draft april 21 1993 summary compare to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollar wiretap be only worth two cent a month to police so the propose wiretap chip must raise phone cost by less than one part in three thousand to be cost-effective background until now phone have happen to allow the existence of `` wiretap '' detector which could pick up conversation on a phone line and over time law enforcement agency have come to rely on this capability to aid in criminal investigation however powerful new encryption technology threaten this status quo by make possible truly private communication a small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphone at either end in order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agency to tap phone conversation the u.s. government announce on april 16 1993 that it have developed and begin manufacturing a special `` wiretap '' chip to be place in future phone instead of the total privacy chip which have be under private development the same day at t announce it would use these chip `` in all it secure telephone product '' each chip would be create under government supervision when it would be give a fix indentifier and encryption key periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast it identifier and other info in a special `` law enforcement block '' law enforcement officer with a court order could then obtain the key correspond to the indentifier from special trust agency and could thereby listen in on any future or previously record conversation on that phone to date most concern voiced about this plan have be about it security the government disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit it access in the way it have claimed the track record of previous government do not inspire confidence on this point 1 however this paper will neglect these concern and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip be a cost-effective tool for police investigation that be which be a cheaper way for society to investigate crime force phone communication to support wiretap or give police agency more money to investigate crime in other way or to put it another way would police agency be willing to pay for each wiretap if they have to pay their share of the full social cost of force phone to support wiretap to start to answer this question we might compare the current benefit wiretap provide to law enforcement agency with project cost of implement the new wiretap chip plan and since current benefit be easy to estimate we begin there wiretap benefit 1990 be the late year for which wiretap statistic be available 2 in that year 872 wiretap installation be request and no request be deny this figure do not include wiretap obtain with the consent of a party to the conversation 2057 arrest result from wiretap start the same year 1486 arrest come from wiretap in previous year and 55 of arrest lead to conviction 76 of the wiretap be for phone v pager email etc 60 be regard drug offense and 40 be request by federal authority each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487 call 22 of them incriminate among 131 people and cost an average of 45,125 extrapolate from the 794 installation reporting cost mostly for labor thus a total of about 40 million be spent on wiretap to obtain about 4000 arrest at 10,000 per arrest thus these arrest be at least four time more expensive than the 2500 per arrest figure one get by divide the 28 billion spent by all police nationally by the total 11 million non-traffic arrest 3 thus the 30 million per year spent on phone tap be only one thousanth of the total police expenditure and if we divide this by the 138 million phone `` access '' line in the country 3 we get about 23 cent spent per year per phone line or about two cent a month in general we deter a give class of criminal through a combination of a perceive probability of be caught and convict and some expect punishment level if convict so the social value of have wiretap be no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other mean if unable to wiretap a particular suspect 's phone police might instead use hidden microphone or investigate that suspect in other way or police might focus on suspect more easily investigate without wiretap or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain type of crime if we generously assume that these substitute for wiretap would be on average twice a expensive a wiretap then the annual social benefit of phone wiretap be about equal to the current spending level of two cent a month per phone line wiretap cost let u for the moment optimistically assume that the u government encryption scheme be a secure a whatever private enterprise would have offer instead protect our conversation from the spy ear of neighbor corporation and government both foreign and domestic even so the need to support wiretap would add many additional cost to build and maintain our communication system extra law enforcement block would be add to phone transmission increase traffic by some unknown percentage a special process must be use to add encryption key to chip while securely distribute these key to special agency which must be fund and monitor the chip themselves be design by a military contractor whose design be to remain secret and be manufacture through a special process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart chip be now offer at the relatively high price of 30 a peice in lot of 10,000 4 private encryption system not support wiretap would require none of these extra cost perhaps most important government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standard for how voice be to be represent encrypt and exchange in our future phone it be widely believe that government be less efficient than private enterprise in procure product and standard though they may perhaps perform a useful brokering role when we choose between compete private standard how much less efficient be a matter of debate some say they pay twice a much while others might say only 10 more currently a total of 96 billion be spent a operating expense of u.s. phone company 3 which come out to about 60 per month per access line if we compare this to the wiretap value of two cent per month we see that if wiretap raise average operating cost by even a much a one part in 3000 then wiretap be not cost effective and this even include extra cost phone owner pay because their encryption chip be more expensive of course most phone have encryption chip for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone be still the same so this argument still applies conclusion give this dramatic difference between the total cost of run the phone system and the value of wiretap we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretap when the only modification require be to allow investigator in to attach clip to phone wire wiretap support may have be reasonable but when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof be clearly on those propose such modification to show that the cost would really be less than the benefit if consensus can not be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate a compromise might be to tax phone which do not support wiretap at a rate of say five cent per month a tax payable to police agency nationwide to compensate them

b"brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid and the fact that the government have financial leverage if they cooperate an important issue especially if one of the escrow agent decides rather stop offering the service i assume that if the escrow agent the government then the contract for provide escrow service would include some termination clause like return the key but who 's the user pay the fee here and what 's the service if the user be the government then the funding 's not separate from the government if the user be the buyer what 's the service keep the key for me no thanks i need and buy their service not tell everybody my key sound like blackmail if the user be the manufacturer do the user have a choice about buying the alternative be to just generate the key and not escrow it which be fine certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key face it the escrow provider be provide a service the user want the only people who want it be the government not the user what really talk about be either the government pay for the service up front or per-year either from general tax or from a special direct tax on wiretap chip or on an indirect tax force the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent i hope the escrow people have no way of find out your name from your serial number especially if the escrow be a government agency here in new jersey we have lot of people willing to provide that sort of service for user fee there be people willing to keep your store from burning down for a small monthly fee though sometimes people refuse to pay and discover that the service really be effective if you go to a baseball game at yankee stadium there be people who will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee something could scratch the paint after all and what a shame if your clipper key get out"

b"dear senator/congressman/president fill in the blank i be write you to voice my strong opposition to president clinton 's clipper chip initiative this proposal to establish a secret government design cryptography chip with government key registration a the standard for voice encryption be very disturb the idea that citizen must register their secret with the government just in case they be try to keep them secret be patently unamerican additionally the press release for this program strongly imply that other form of cryptography would be ban after the clipper chip standard be in place this late attack on our civil right be deeply disturb and be frankly a voting issue for me the president press release state that the plan strike a balance between the legitimate need of law enforcement and a citizen right to privacy but this be not the case the fact be that since other strong cryptographic equipment be avalible the criminal drug dealer and terrorist mention in the press release will simply use non clipper cryptography meanwhile the average citizen may gain no protection against warentless wiretap by the government since the government escrowed key be derive deterministicly from the unit serial number which be broadcast by the chip durring it opperation this seem like an obvious back door for the nsa and law enforcement if you still do nott understand my objection to key registration consider the way j. edgar hoover blackmail government official like yourself would you now use a phone to transmit personal detail of your life that the nsa and fbi have the key to ______________________________________________________________________________ well here a letter i didnt spell check it since i dont know how in emacs so you might want to do that"

b"steve bellovin writes a well-thought-out and nearly persuasive article about why the clipper be we still call it clipper today or have they figure out a non-infringing word yet protocol be almost a good a one can do give their march ordes i 'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument in my view the primary remain flaw be that the encryption algorithm be secret lead to suspicion that there be a back door without complete disclosure this suspicion can not be dispel no matter how many trust expert be allow to look at it in isolation be it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm the only concern see with make skipjack public be that someone could build clipperphones without register the key assume f can really be kept secret a the government assumes then a part of the initial connection a clipperphone executes a protocol with the pseudophone to demonstrate that they both know f. for example the initiate phone pick a number q and sends e q f the receiver sends back e q+1 f and the initiator sends back e q+2 f to demonstrate that her first packet just a random 64-bit block repeat in the opposite direction with another q so it be defeat by somebody building up a library of sequential number by remember response and use those response a the initial number of subsequent challenge this way clipperphones will talk only to other clipperphones of course the pseudo company can build their own proprietary skipjack phone but the presidential fact sheet implies that they get approval for it without equivalent key escrow what 's wrong with this picture it depends of f stay secret and on skipjack be resistant to cryptanalysis but the government appear to believe in both of these even if the particular q a i suggest have some flaw i imagine there 's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that agree my view and you can quote me if not worth do not worth do well"

to cryptography thwart the state via technology give at the future of freedom conference november 1987 you know technology -- and particularly computer technology -- have often gotten a bad rap in libertarian cir- cles we tend to think of orwell 's 1984 or terry gilliam's brazil or the proximity detector keep east berlin's slave/citizens on their own side of the border or the so- phisticated bugging device nixon use to harass those on his `` enemy list '' or we recognize that for the price of a ticket on the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of sound but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run by a government policeman and permit him to paw thru our be- longing if it beep but i think that mind-set be a mistake before there be cattle prod government torture their prisoner with club and rubber hose before there be laser for eavesdropping government use binoculars and lip-readers though government certainly us technology to oppress the evil lie not in the tool but in the wielder of the tool in fact technology represent one of the most promis- ing avenue available for re-capturing our freedom from those who have steal them by it very nature it favor the bright who can put it to use over the dull who can- not it favor the adaptable who be quick to see the merit of the new over the sluggish who cling to time- test way and what two well word be there to de- scribe government bureaucracy than `` dull '' and `` sluggish '' one of the clearest classic triumph of technology over tyranny i see be the invention of the man-portable crossbow with it an untrained peasant could now reliably and lethally engage a target out to fifty meter -- even if that target be a mount chain-mailed knight unlike the longbow which admittedly be more powerful and could get off more shot per unit time the crossbow require no formal training to utilize whereas the longbow require elaborate visual tactile and kinesthetic coordination to achieve any degree of accuracy the wielder of a crossbow could simply put the weapon to his shoulder sight along the arrow itself and be reasonably assure of hit his tar- get moreover since just about the only mount knight likely to visit your average peasant would be government soldier and tax collector the utility of the device be plain with it the common rabble could defend themselves not only against one another but against their governmental master it be the medieval equivalent of the armor- pierce bullet and consequently king and priest the medieval equivalent of a bureau of alcohol tobacco and crossbow threaten death and excommunication respec- tively for it unlawful possession look at later development we see how technology like the firearm -- particularly the repeat rifle and the handgun later follow by the gatling gun and more advanced machine gun -- radically alter the balance of interpersonal and inter-group power not without reason be the colt .45 call `` the equalizer '' a frail dance-hall hostess with one in her possession be now fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon advertise- ments for the period also reflect the merchandising of the repeat cartridge rifle by declare that `` a man on horseback arm with one of these rifle simply can not be capture '' and a long a his captor be rely upon flintlock or single-shot rifle the quote be doubtless a true one update now to the present the public-key cipher with a personal computer to run it represent an equiv- alent quantum leap -- in a defensive weapon not only can such a technique be use to protect sensitive data in one's own possession but it can also permit two stranger to ex- change information over an insecure communication channel -- a wiretapped phone line for example or skywriting for that matter -- without ever have previously met to exchange cipher key with a thousand-dollar com- puter you can create a cipher that a multi-megabuck cray x-mp crack in a year within a few year it should be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi- cation soon after that full-color digitize video image technology will not only have make wiretapping obsolete it will have totally demolish government 's control over in- formation transfer like to take just a moment to sketch the mathemat- ic which make this principle possible this algorithm be call the rsa algorithm after rivest shamir and adleman who jointly create it it security derives from the fact that if a very large number be the product of two very large prime then it be extremely difficult to obtain the two prime factor from analysis of their product `` ex- tremely '' in the sense that if prime p and q have 100 digit apiece then their 200-digit product can not in gen- eral be factor in less than 100 year by the most powerful computer now in existence the `` public '' part of the key consists of 1 the prod- uct pq of the two large prime p and q and 2 one fac- tor call it x of the product xy where xy p-1 q-1 1 the `` private '' part of the key consists of the other factor y. each block of the text to be encrypt be first turn into an integer -- either by use ascii or even a simple a=01 b=02 c=03 ... z=26 representation this integer be then raise to the power x modulo pq and the result integer be then sent a the encrypt message the receiver decrypts by take this integer to the secret power y modulo pq it can be show that this process will always yield the original number start with what make this a groundbreaking development and why it be call `` public-key '' cryptography '' be that i can openly publish the product pq and the number x while keep secret the number y -- so that anyone can send me an encrypt message namely x a mod pq but only i can recover the original message a by take what they send raise it to the power y and take the result mod pq the risky step meeting to exchange cipher key have be eliminate so people who may not even trust each other enough to want to meet may still reliably ex- change encrypt message -- each party have select and disseminate his own pq and his x while maintain the secrecy of his own y. another benefit of this scheme be the notion of a `` dig- ital signature '' to enable one to authenticate the source of a give message normally if i want to send you a message i raise my plaintext a to your x and take the result mod your pq and send that however if in my message i take the plaintext a and raise it to my secret power y take the result mod my pq then raise that result to your x mod your pq and send this then even after you have normally `` decrypt '' the message it will still look like garbage however if you then raise it to my public power x and take the result mod my public pq so you will not only recover the ori- ginal plaintext message but you will know that no one but i could have sent it to you since no one else know my secret y and these be the very concern by the way that be to- day torment the soviet union about the whole question of personal computer on the one hand they recognize that american schoolchildren be right now grow up with com- puters a commonplace a sliderules use to be -- more so in fact because there be thing computer can do which will interest and instruct 3- and 4-year-olds and it be pre- cisely these student who one generation hence will be go head-to-head against their soviet counterpart for the soviet to hold back might be a suicidal a continue to teach swordsmanship while your adversary be learn ballistics on the other hand whatever else a personal computer may be it be also an exquisitely efficient copying machine -- a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 word of text and can be copy in a couple of minute if this threaten enough the computer that performs the copy can also encrypt the data in a fashion that be all but unbreakable remember that in soviet society publicly ac- cessible xerox machine be unknown the relatively few copying machine in existence be control more inten- sively than machine gun be in the united state now the `` conservative '' position be that we should not sell these computer to the soviet because they could use them in weapon system the `` liberal '' position be that we should sell them in the interest of mutual trade and cooperation -- and anyway if we make the sale there will certainly be some other nation willing to for my part ready to suggest that the libertarian position should be to give them to the soviet for free and if necessary make them take them and if that work load up an sr-71 blackbird and air drop them over moscow in the middle of the night paid for by private sub- scription of course not taxation i confess that this be not a position that have gain much support among member of the conventional left-right political spectrum but af- ter all in the word of one of illuminatus 's character we be political non-euclideans the shortest distance to a particular goal may not look anything like what most people would consider a `` straight line '' take a long enough world-view it be arguable that break the soviet govern- ment monopoly on information transfer could well lead to the enfeeblement and indeed to the ultimate dissolution of the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen missile aim at moscow but there 's the rub a `` long enough '' world view do suggest that the evil the oppressive the coercive and the simply stupid will `` get what they deserve '' but what 's not immediately clear be how the rest of u can escape be kill enslave or pauperize in the process when the liberal and other collectivist begin to at- tack freedom they possess a reasonably stable healthy function economy and almost unlimited time to proceed to hamstring and dismantle it a policy of political gradualism be at least conceivable but now we have patchwork crazy-quilt economy held together by baling wire and spit the state not only tax u to `` feed the poor '' while also induce farmer to slaughter milk cow and drive up food price -- it then simultaneously turn around and sub- sidizes research into agricultural chemical design to in- crease yield of milk from the cow left alive or witness the fact that a decline in the price of oil be consider a potentially frighten a a comparable increase a few year ago when the price go up we be told the economy risk collapse for for want of energy the price increase be call the `` moral equivalent of war '' and the fed swung into action for the first time in american history the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be- come an issue of federal concern now when the price of oil drop again we risk problem this time because ameri- can oil company and third world basket-case nation who sell oil may not be able to ever pay their debt to our grossly over-extended bank the suggest panacea be that government should now re-raise the oil price that opec have lower via a new oil tax since the government be seek to raise oil price to about the same extent a opec do what can we call this except the `` moral equivalent of civil war -- the government against it own people '' and classically in international trade can you imag- ine any entity in the world except a government go to court claim that a vendor be sell it good too cheaply and demand not only that that naughty vendor be compel by the court to raise it price but also that it be punish for the act of lower them in the first place so while the statists could afford to take a couple of hundred year to trash our economy and our liberty -- we certainly can not count on have an equivalent period of stability in which to reclaim them i contend that there exists almost a `` black hole '' effect in the evolution of nation-states just a in the evolution of star once free- dom contract beyond a certain minimum extent the state warp the fabric of the political continuum about itself to the degree that subsequent re-emergence of freedom becomes all but impossible a good illustration of this can be see in the area of so-called `` welfare '' payment when those who sup at the public trough outnumber and thus outvote those whose tax must replenish the trough then what possible choice have a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak- ing from the few for the unearned benefit of the many go down to the near `` welfare '' office find just two people on the dole and recognize that between them they form a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on the question of who own your life -- and the fruit of your life 's labor so essentially those who love liberty need an `` edge '' of some sort if ultimately go to prevail we obvi- ously use the altruist `` other-directedness '' of '' work slave suffer sacrifice so that next generation of a billion random stranger can live in a well world '' recognize that however immoral such an appeal might be it be nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today 's culture if you can convince people to work energetically for a '' cause '' care only enough for their personal welfare so a to remain alive enough and healthy enough to continue work -- then you have a truly massive reservoir of energy to draw from equally clearly this be just the sort of ap- peal which tautologically can not be utilized for egoistic or libertarian goal if i be to stand up before you tonight and say something like `` listen follow me a i enunciate my noble `` cause '' contribute your money to support the `` cause '' give up your free time to work for the `` cause '' strive selflessly to bring it about and then after you and your child be dead maybe your child 's child will actu- ally live under egoism '' -- all think go mad and of course be right because the point try to make be that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if when and a individual libertarian and/or egoist find it profitable and/or enjoyable to do so and probably only then while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli- tical action i believe that it be the only nor even necessarily the most cost-effective path toward increase freedom in our time consider that for a fraction of the investment in time money and effort i might expend in try- ing to convince the state to abolish wiretapping and all form of censorship -- i can teach every libertarian who 's in- terested how to use cryptography to abolish them unilaterally there be a maxim -- a proverb -- generally attribute to the eskimoes which very likely most libertarian have al- ready heard and while you likely would not quarrel with the say you might well feel that heard it often enough already and that it have nothing far to teach u and moreover that maybe even tire of hearing it i shall therefore repeat it now if you give a man a fish the say run you feed him for a day but if you teach a man how to fish you feed him for a lifetime your exposure to the quote be probably in some sort of a `` workfare '' vs. `` welfare '' context namely that if you genuinely wish to help someone in need you should teach him how to earn his sustenance not simply how to beg for it and of course this be true if only because the next time he be hungry there might not be anybody around willing or even able to give him a fish whereas with the information on how to fish he be completely self sufficient but i submit that this exhaust only the first order content of the quote and if there be nothing far to glean from it i would have waste your time by cite it again after all it seem to have almost a crypto-altruist slant a though to imply that we should structure our ac- tivities so a to maximize the benefit to such hungry beggar a we may encounter but consider suppose this eskimo know how to fish but he do know how to hunt walrus you on the other hand have often go hungry while travel thru walrus country because you have no idea how to catch the damn thing and they ate most of the fish you could catch and now suppose the two of you decide to exchange information bartering fishing knowledge for hunt knowledge well the first thing to observe be that a transaction of this type categorically and unambiguously refutes the marxist premise that every trade must have a `` winner '' and a `` loser '' the idea that if one person gain it must necessarily be at the '' expense '' of another person who loses clearly under this scenario such be not the case each party have gain some- thing he do not have before and neither have be dimin- ished in any way when it come to exchange of information rather than material object life be no longer a zero-sum game this be an extremely powerful notion the `` law of diminish return '' the `` first and second law of thermodynamics '' -- all those `` law '' which constrain our possi- bilities in other context -- no longer bind u now anarchy or consider another possibility suppose this hungry eskimo never learn to fish because the ruler of his nation-state have decreed fishing illegal because fish contain dangerous tiny bone and sometimes sharp spine he tell u the state have decreed that their consumption -- and even their possession -- be too hazardous to the people's health to be permit even by knowledgeable willing adult perhaps it be because citizen body be thought to be government property and therefore it be the function of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern- ment property or perhaps it be because the state gener- ously extends to competent adult the `` benefit '' it provide to child and to the mentally ill namely a full-time all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship -- so that they need not trouble themselves with make choice about behavior thought physically risky or morally `` naughty '' but in any case you stare stupefy while your eskimo informant re- lates how this law be take so seriously that a friend of his be recently imprison for year for the crime of `` pos- session of nine ounce of trout with intent to distribute '' now you may conclude that a society so grotesquely oppressive a to enforce a law of this type be simply an affront to the dignity of all human being you may go far- ther and decide to commit some portion of your discretion- ary recreational time specifically to the task of thwart this tyrant 's goal your rationale may be `` altruistic '' in the sense of want to liberate the oppress or '' egoistic '' in the sense of prove you can outsmart the oppressor -- or very likely some combination of these or per- hap even other motif but since you have zero desire to become a martyr to your `` cause '' not about to mount a military campaign or even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade however it be here that technology -- and in particular in- formation technology -- can multiply your efficacy literally a hundredfold i say `` literally '' because for a fraction of the effort and virtually none of the risk attendant to smuggle in a hundred fish you can quite readily produce a hundred xerox copy of fishing instruction if the tar- get government like present-day america at least permit open discussion of topic whose implementation be re- stricted then that should suffice but if the government attempt to suppress the flow of information a well then you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write your fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypt accord to your mythical eskimo 's public-key parameter but a far a increase real-world access to fish you have make genuine nonzero headway -- which may continue to snowball a others re-disseminate the information you have provide and you have not have to waste any of your time try to convert id- eological adversary or even try to win over the unde- cided recall harry browne 's dictum from `` freedom in an unfree world '' that the success of any endeavor be in general inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua- sion be necessary to it fulfilment if you look at history you can not deny that it have be dramatically shape by men with name like washington lincoln nixon marcos duvalier khadaffi and their ilk but it have also be shape by people with name like edison curie marconi tesla and wozniak and this latter shape have be at least a per- vasive and not nearly so bloody and where try to take the libertech project rather than beseeching the state to please not en- slave plunder or constrain u i propose a libertarian net- work spread the technology by which we may seize freedom for ourselves but here we must be a bit careful while it be not at present illegal to encrypt information when government want to spy on you there be no guarantee of what the fu- ture may hold there have be bill introduce for exam- ple which would have make it a crime to wear body armor when government want to shoot you that be if you be to commit certain crime while wear a kevlar vest then that fact would constitute a separate federal crime of it own this law to my knowledge have not pass yet but it do indicate how government think other technological application however do indeed pose legal risk we recognize for example that anyone who help a pre-civil war slave escape on the `` underground railroad '' be make a clearly illegal use of technology -- a the sovereign government of the united state of america at that time found the buying and sell of human being quite a acceptable a the buying and sell of cattle simi- larly during prohibition anyone who use his bathtub to ferment yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug alcohol -- the control substance wine -- be use technol- ogy in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agent for his `` crime '' -- unfortunately not to be restore to life when congress reverse itself and re-permitted use of this drug so to quote a former president un-indicted co- conspirator and pardon felon `` let me make one thing perfectly clear '' the libertech project do not advocate participate in or conspire in the violation of any law -- no matter how oppressive unconstitutional or simply stupid such law may be it do engage in description for educa- tional and informational purpose only of technological process and some of these process like fly a plane or manufacturing a firearm may well require appropriate li- cense to perform legally fortunately no license be need for the distribution or receipt of information it- self so the next time you look at the political scene and despair think `` well if 51 of the nation and 51 of this state and 51 of this city have to turn libertarian before i 'll be free then somebody might a well cut my goddamn throat now and put me out of my misery '' -- recognize that such be not the case there exist way to make your- self free if

b'i believe it be illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country without an export license others will correct me if this be inaccurate glad to you be correct it be illegal to send cryptographic code and lot of other thing out of the country without a license however every u citizen have a general export license allow export of lot of thing include constitutionally protect speech this have the effect that it be legal for u citizen to export some thing which it be illegal for a u corporation to export without first obtain a license dunno if get one for the particular code you have the only way to find out be to apply for a license nope talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law but in general the government have to have a very good national security case to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to publish yes i word that the way i do intentionally it be a lot easy for the government to try to prevent the export of information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact espionage be probably the only exception note that you need to distinguish between what be legal to send to canada if you have such a license and what be legal to send if you if you be a u citizen you have a general license i be not a lawyer so take some of this with a grain of salt however i have also have to swim through both itar and export regs in a few case -- robert i. eachus'

b'get an idea that would remove most of the political complaint i have about the clipper chip pas a law state that if within a year of performaing a wiretap on someone a police agency manage to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap be for then that agency owes the suspect 1 million to repay him/her for lose privacy of course there be *still* problem with the technical aspect of clipper and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind an attempt to enforce it a a standard but this would be a way for those in favor of allow continued wiretap to assure u that it will only be use in case where the crime be important and the police be all but certain that there really will be a conviction ...'

b'at the risk of get lose in the clipper chip discussion i give a summary on my recent question unfortunately the answer be no conceal the initialisation vector essentially give any additional security i get 3 answer from grady netcom.com mark.lomas cl.cam.ac.uk smb research.att.com that open my eye pretty simple say e be encryption and d decryption with key k on 64-bit block let c 0 be the initialisation vector m 1 m 2 ... the message block c 1 c 2 ... the cipher text block then encryption in cipher block chain cbc mode work by the formula c i e m i xor c i-1 and decryption by m i c i-1 xor d c i so if the attacker have c 0 this only affect the first message block m 1 but she can do her key search attack on m 2 m 3 ... the situation in cipher feedback cfb mode be a bit more complicate but similar and left a an exercise for the reader finally there be the modify output feedback mode ofb where de or whatever block cipher you use simply act a random generator by s i e s i-1 with initialisation vector seed s 0 and encryption be give by c i m i xor s i here the usual know plaintext attack against xor-bitstream cipher reduces the crack to key search for k'

b"i do not think they can use the eavesdropping a evidence at all however use the info they gather while listen they can go search the right place and find good strong evidence which they can use in court question currently it be easy to wire-tap from the technical point of view at least anybody use the appropriate radio receiver can listen to communication between a car-telephone and the ground station the police also obviously the clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the non-authorized person to eavesdrop note that i do not write impossible the privacy will thus improve from the current situation poeple who really have something to hide already do not use the phone to speak of these thing if an illegal operation be really worth one can afford have critical data carry by a person rather than send it electronically the clipper chip will not change this the problem be more politic foreign country will never accept the clipper chip be the access to the escrow can not be directly grant to their own police follow their own law not the u law i.e each country will have it own escrow how then will it be possible to monitor the international traffic or will encrypt international traffic be possible or will there be an international escrow some kind of u.n. thing forbid crypted communication be impractical how be it possible to spot a crypted communication in the thousand of megabyte of data which circulate on the various exist network what about private network and this will be more and more impossible a the volume of electronic traffic will increrase in the next year i think that the clipper chip can only be an interest device to limit the risk of for instance one 's girlfriend 's husband listen to his wife's communication it will bring no more a regard to security be it worth i think so if it cost be limited i think that many privacy invasion be do not only by official service but also by private entity the clipper can help reduce these provide we do not hope too much of it it be not a real danger and it can be helpful"

b'hmmmmmm 30 seem a bit expensive how big be the chip what kind of package will be use 3 volt or 5 volt technology how much current will it draw i think there be many practical question that be answer especially since this chip already exists ok get a big problem with all of this how in the world do you expect to sell these chip for even 30 after all the overhead involve in this program procedure 2-4 people a laptop only 300 chip at a time give me a break and how long do all of this take even if it be a minute per chip it will take the great part of a day to turn out 300 of these thing how long do you suppose it will take to program those 10,000 chip mention above this be highly impractical so where can i find info on this at t device what kind of vocoder do it use do it require isdn phone line if not be it full duplex how do it sound what kind of synchronization scheme be use will all other little black box have to conform to at t choice of protocol etc. will anybody else be allow to build box that conform to these specification'
b"for some reason my finger want to type `` probably '' cause whenever i want to say `` probable '' cause sorry for any confusion in the previous message david"
b'i think they can do that without change the law the chip itself classify and reverse engineering be allow by law possibly unless prohibit by a valid contract the algorithm may be classify but there be many court case ruling that information identical to classfied information but obtain from unclassified source be freely publishable with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information'
b"qualcomm have spare cycle in the dsps for their new cdma digital cellular phone they want to put strong crypto into them since they have the capacity the government decide to `` discourage '' them blowing smoke qualcomm want to sell to nice lucrative overseas market like japan and the ec the government told them `` do encryption if you ever hope to export this technology '' the reason that cdma have encryption be not because the g-man come a'knocking at qualcomm 's door because qualcomm think that the u market for digital cellular be big enough for them this be just the international traffic in arm regulation all over again perry have already state on the net that qualcomm want to sell overseas and the government told them they be allow to export so only blowing the same smoke you be sure they probably could have make a u version and a non-crypto export version and contract with a bulgarian or japanese software house to develop an overseas crypto rom but get pretty expensive no cylink sell their phone because willing to make different stuff for domestic use vs. export qualcomm so cylink make money -- capitalism comrade well some people like capitalism and others prefer free enterprise different use the government to stifle your competition be capitalist someone out there will build a unit to do all this well yet prehaps someone will produce a package that turn any 486 box with a sound card into a secure phone `` someone '' this and `` someone '' that if you think so easy why be you whine on the net instead of get your butt in gear and write it write good crypto code be something most good programmer can do write good new crypto algorithm be a very specialized skill develop new voice cod algorithm be also pretty specialized but find way to implement the more complex one when you have enough horsepower be still fairly hairy stuff once the 586/pentium becomes widespread or the next generation of sound board have dsps on it i suspect see it happen maybe the vanilla 486+soundblaster be enough"
b"ever since craig rowland post his piece `` new encryption '' to sci.crypt there have be some discussion of our company secure communication technology inc and on encryption algorithm nea i spoke to craig at length on 4/21/93 and we cover a lot of ground some of the information in the post require some clarification and i would like to answer some of the question raise on sci.crypt sct be a small company base in silver spring maryland our two main product at this time be a pc base secure communication program call secom and a general purpose encryption chip which us the nea algorithm developed for secom secom provide an encrypt secure communication link between two pc 's connect over dial up telephone line it support simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard to screen `` chat '' it have it own proprietary communication protocol which be tightly integrate to the encryption all though it be a packetized link the data stream appear to be continuous because the packet boundary be hidden when secom be initially developed it be implement to use de encryption a business decision be make to seek export approval for the product because it be perceive that the overseas market be a large one and provide a good marketing opportunity we soon found out that we would never be grant general export approval for anything use de all though the reason for this be never explicitly state it seem to have something to do with secret government to government agreement which be still in effect in any event the decision be make to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of de this be the reason nea new encryption algorithm be born at this time nea be be held a a trade secret the preliminary work of patent it have begin and the plan be to make it public once the patent process be complete all though one can make certain legal argument for keep it an ongoing secret i think in the case of an encryption algorithm it be necessary to let people `` shoot at it '' over an extend period of time to prove it worth in order to get export approval for secom/nea it be necessary to go through nsa and to reveal to them the detail of the program and algorithm this be do only after we have a finish product to submit let me state unequivocally that there be no `` back door '' to the program or the algorithm secure communication technology be a closely held private company and nsa/fbi/cia/nist/whatever have no financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the people involve from a practical business standpoint we be interested in sell chip and software hopefully in large quantity and a back door to the encryption if found out could destroy our credibility and our business with the encryption algorithm approve for export we set out to talk to a number of potential customer for encryption product and system we be able to identify several common thread of functionality requirement this lead to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm `` cast in silicon '' and certain other capability add so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirement that we identify we be strongly oppose to the clipper/capstone chip in a press release today our president dr. stephen bryen state `` it seem a if the government have an unlimited source of fund to use to push it new bug chip on the american public but do we not understand how the national security agency which be not suppose to be involve in domestic spy can fund the development of a commercial chip intend to accommodate u.s. government domestic spy activity ''"
b"the attorney general publishes the number of court-ordered tap each year it enough around a thousand for the average non-crook non-spy to worry about in fact consider any reasonable guess about the number of big-time crook and spy around it may not be enough even for most crook and spy to worry about there 's no reason to believe that it will go up with clipper since the number of tap now include many target too stupid to use encryption base on the playback heard in court case david"
