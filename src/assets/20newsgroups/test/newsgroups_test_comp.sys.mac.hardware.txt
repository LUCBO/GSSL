post all piece be available for anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu 18.172.1.27 in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh except for this introductory faq which appear in multiple newsgroups and be store a general-faq.z the name of each file have the format of the last part of the group name follow by `` -faq.z '' e.g the faq for comp.sys.mac.system be store a system-faq.z and the faq for comp.sys.mac.misc be store a misc-faq.z rtfm store file a compress .z binary file if you leave off the .z at the end of the file name when `` get '' the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file before send it to you you can also have these file mail to you by send an e-mail message to mail-server rtfm.mit.edu with the line send pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/ '' name '' in the body text where `` name '' be the name of the file you want a specify above e.g general-faq you can also send this server a message with the subject `` help '' for more detailed instruction ==================== i have a question ... 1.0 ==================== congratulation you 've come to the right place usenet be a wonderful resource for information range from basic question how do i lock a floppy disk to query that would make steve job himself run scream from the room in terror i use resedit to remove resource init 11 wdef 34 and nvir 17 from my system file and use the hex editor to add code string a67b45 a a patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box would be a nice shade of mauve everything work fine until i instal supercdevblaster and now when i use the aldus driver to print from pagemaker 5.0d4 to a linotronic 6000 my system hang p.s i 'm run system 6.0.2 on a powerbook 170 since the macintosh newsgroups be medium to high volume we ask that you first peruse this faq list include at least the table of content for the other piece of it check any other relevant on-line resource list below in question 1.2 especially the faq list for the other macintosh newsgroups and rtfm read the friendly manual before post your question we realize that you be personally incense that the system be take up fourteen of your newly-installed twenty meg of ram but this question have already make it way around the world three hundred time before and it 's develop tire foot finally before post to any newsgroup macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of usenet a described in the newsgroup news.announce.newusers how do i use this document where can i get it 1.1 comp.sys.mac.faq be currently divide into multiple piece a general introduction which you 're reading now and specific list for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc faq list for comp.sys.mac.wanted comp.sys.mac.apps and comp.sys.mac.hardware be in development when ready each part will be available in it respective newsgroup all piece be available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory except for this document itself which be name general-faq.z the piece be name a per the last part of the newsgroup they cover follow by `` -faq '' e.g system-faq.z misc-faq.z the .z mean the file be store compress so you 'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either maccompress stuffit deluxe or the unix uncompress command to decompress it however if you leave off the `` .z '' extension when you `` get '' the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file before send it to you this introductory document be post to all of the concerned newsgroups the table of content for each of the specific faq list be at the begin of this file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether your question be answer anywhere else in the faq even if you do n't have the other part at hand it 's not always obvious especially to newcomer where a particular question or comment should be post please familiarize yourself with the faq list in all the major macintosh newsgroups before post in any of them which question appear in which faq can serve a a basic guide to what post belong where to jump to a particular question search for section-number.question-number enclose in parenthesis for example to find `` where can i ftp macintosh software '' search for the string `` 2.1 '' to jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question number what other information be available 1.2 comp.sys.mac.faq provide short answer to a number of frequently ask question appropriate for the usenet newsgroup comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system four other file be worthy of particular note daryl spitzer maintains a faq list cover macintosh program for the newsgroup comp.sys.mac.programmer it 's post to that group weekly and available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon 128.223.8.8 in /pub/mac eric rosen maintains a frequently ask question list for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq where the file you 're reading now be also irregularly archive this list answer many frequently ask question about networking unix and the mac telecommunication and foreign file format norm walsh have compile an excellent faq for comp.fonts that answer a lot of question about the various kind of font and cross-platform conversion and printing it 's available in comp.fonts or by ftp from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/faq* finally jim jagielski maintains a faq for comp.unix.aux cover apple 's unix environment a/ux it 's post every 2 to 3 week in comp.unix.aux and news.answers it 's available for anonymous ftp at jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov which newsgroup should i post to 1.3 there be no stupid question but there be misplace one you would n't ask your english teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one would you so do n't ask the programmer newsgroup why your system be so slow when microsoft word be in the background ignorance of basic netiquette be not an excuse if you want people to help you you need to learn their way of communicate post question to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearl of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oyster too post to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thunder silence for instance the most common and glare mispost one that seem a incongruous to dweller in the macintosh region of usenet a would a purple elephant to aleut in the arctic ask a question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm normally produce no useful response post the same question to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post be read and consider by dozen of experienced network administrator and not a few network software designer please post to exactly one newsgroup do not cross-post if a question be n't important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs it 's not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading for the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be use a a catch-all newsgroup the breakdown of question between different newsgroups in this document can also serve a a reasonable guide to what belongs where specifically question about productivity application software you bought your macintosh to run not software you bought to make your macintosh run well should go to comp.sys.mac.apps unless the application be cover in a more specific newsgroup communication program game hypercard compiler and database all have more topical comp.sys.mac newsgroups post question about non-communications hardware include question about what software be necessary to make particular hardware work to comp.sys.mac.hardware question about macos system software belong in comp.sys.mac.system question about utility and extension normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc question about a/ux go to comp.unix.aux detailed question about appletalk belong in comp.protocols.appletalk direct question about hypercard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard non-hypercard program question and question about development environment should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer resedit question may be post either to comp.sys.mac.misc comp.sys.mac.system or comp.sys.mac.programmer but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recess of comp.sys.mac.programmer be considerably more practice at the art of resource hack a general exception to the above rule be that any very technical question about an application that actually begin to delve into the how 's of a program a well a the what 's recent example how do writenow which be write entirely in assembly compare to other word processor write in high level language might be well address to the programmer newsgroup for sale and want to buy post should go to comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac only we understand that you 're desperate to sell your upgraded 128k mac to get the for a powerbook 180 but trust me anyone who want to buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted political and religious question the mac be well than window be not be too be not be too hey how 'bout the amiga what about it be not be too belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy anything not specifically mention above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc finally do n't be so provincial a to consider only the comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forum for your question many question about modem in comp.sys.mac.comm be much more thoroughly discuss in comp.dcom.modems question about mac midi be often well handle in comp.music even though it 's not a macintosh specific newsgroup shop around usenet 's a big place and not everything relevant to the macintosh happens in comp.sys.mac 4. someone just ask why the system be take up sixteen of their twenty megabyte of ram should n't i put my brilliance and wit on display for the world by post the seventeenth response no frequent answer be just a boring and uninteresting a frequent question unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answer such a the recent discovery that font in system 7.1 could eat memory private e-mail be a much well medium for answer common question like this one you might want to add a mention of this faq in your e-mail response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before post future question i do read all the newsgroups cover here and have write a small script in microphone ii that let me send pwfaq 's people with frequently ask question the section of this document that answer their question with just the click of a button so please do n't feel obligate to respond to someone who care so little about the answer to their question they ca n't be troubled to read the faq list to get it === ftp 2.0 === where can i ftp mac software 2.1 the three major north american internet archive of shareware freeware and demo software be sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 mac.archive.umich.edu 141.211.165.41 and wuarchive.wustl.edu 128.252.135.4 which mirror the other two site and several others wuarchive often hold on to file after other site remove them for space concern and still have file that be delete from the formerly important site rascal.ics.utexas.edu rascal be notable for store it file in macbinary format rather than the less efficient binhex format common at the other archive unless otherwise note shareware and freeware mention in this document should be available at the above site to keep traffic on the internet manageable scandinavian should try connect to ftp.funet.fi 128.214.6.100 ftp.lth.se 130.235.20.3 or sics.se 192.16.123.90 instead those in the u.k. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk 146.169.2.1 continental european can try nic.switch.ch 130.59.1.40 ezinfo.ethz.ch 129.132.2.72 and anl.anl.fr 192.54.179.1 australian user should try to find what they want at archie.au 139.130.4.6 which mirror info-mac and mac.archive japanese user will find sumex mirror at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp 130.69.254.254 a fourth very important site be ftp.apple.com 130.43.2.3 this be apple 's semi-official repository for system software developer tool source code technical note and other thing that come more or less straight from apple 's mouth some material at this site may not be distribute outside the u.s. or by other site that do n't have an official license to distribute apple system software please read the various readme document available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're connect from outside the u.s. or if you wish to redistribute material you find here can i get shareware by e-mail 2.2 the info-mac archive at sumex-aim be available by e-mail from listserv ricevm1.bitnet alternately listserv ricevm1.rice.edu the listserver responds to the command macarch help macarch index and macarch get filename mac archive file be available from mac mac.archive.umich.edu send it a message contain the word `` help '' and `` index '' no quote on the first two line of your message for instruction on get start and a list of the file you may request you can retrieve file from other site by use the server at ftpmail decwrl.dec.com for detail send it a message with just the text `` help '' no quote where can i find application x 2.3 if you ca n't find what you 're look for at one of the above site try telnetting to your near archie server or send it an e-mail message address to archie with the subject `` help '' archie server be locate at archie.rutgers.edu 128.6.18.15 america archie.mcgill.ca 132.206.2.3 the original archie server in canada archie.au 139.130.4.6 australia archie.funet.fi 128.214.6.100 scandinavia and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk 146.169.3.7 the u.k. and the continent these site index the ten of thousand of file available for anonymous ftp login a `` archie '' no password be need and type `` prog filename '' to find what you 're look for or type `` help '' for more detailed instruction for instance you would type `` prog disinfectant '' to search for a convenient ftp site for disinfectant if the initial search fails to turn up the file you want try variation on and substring of the name for instance if you do n't find disinfectant with `` prog disinfectant '' you might try `` prog disi '' instead substring search often hide the gold in a pile of dross to avoid many erroneous match add a `` *\\.hqx '' to the end of the substring e.g `` prog disi *\\.hqx '' most mac software available on the net end in .hqx but almost no unix or pc software do please check the above archive and archie personally before ask where you can find a particular piece of shareware if you follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software can someone mail me application x 2.4 no nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from comp.binaries.mac that be corrupt or miss at your site please refer to the first question in this section to find out about anonymous ftp archie and automatic e-mail server what be .bin .hqx .cpt .etc 2.5 most file available by ftp be modify twice to allow them to more easily pas through foreign computer system first they're compress to make them faster to download and then they're translate to either a binhex .hqx or macbinary .bin format that other computer can digest the macintosh us a special two-fork filing system that choke most other computer binhex file be 7-bit ascii text file while macbinary file be pure 8-bit binary data that must always be transfer use a binary protocol how a file have be translate and compress for transmission be indicate by it suffix normally a file will have a name something like filename.xxx.yyy .xxx indicates how it be compress and .yyy indicates how it be translate to use a file you 've ftp 'd and download to your mac you 'll need to reverse the process most file you get from the net require a two-step decode process first change the binhex .hqx or macbinary .bin file to a double-clickable macintosh file then decompress it which program decode which file type be cover in the table below also note that most macintosh telecommunication program will automatically convert macbinary file to regular macintosh file a they be download *************************************************************************** suffix .sit .cpt .hqx .bin .pit .z .image .dd .zip .uu .tar extractor -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- stuffit 3.0| x x x

*************************************************************************** a few note on the decompressors stuffit be a family of product that use several different compression scheme the freeware stuffit expander will unstuff all of them version of stuffit earlier than 3.0 stuffit 1.5.1 stuffit classic unstuffit and stuffit deluxe 2.0 and 1.0 will not unstuff the increase number of file stuffed by stuffit 3.0. you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit expander stuffit 3.0.5 lite and deluxe consistently make small archive than any other macintosh compression utility to allow maximum space for file on the various ftp site and to keep net-bandwidth down please compress all file you send to anonymous ftp site with stuffit 3.0.5. uutool maccompress and suntar handle the popular unix format of uuencode .uu compress .z and tar .tar respectively the unix version be often more robust than the mac product so use them instead when that 's an option translator that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar file be also available by anonymous ftp macutil be dik winter 's package of unix utility to decompress and debinhex file on a workstation before download them to a mac since unix store file differently than do the mac macutil creates macbinary .bin file which should be automatically convert on download it ca n't decompress everything in particular it ca n't decompress the new stuffit 3.0 archive however if you need only one or two file out of an archive -- for instance if you want to read the readme to find out if a program do what you need it to do before you download all of it -- macutil be indispensable it can be found at sumex-aim in the info-mac/unix directory a few note on the compression format .bin these be macbinary file always use a binary file transfer protocol when transfer them never ascii or text most file on the net be store a .hqx instead only rascal store most of it file in .bin format most communication program such a zterm and mackermit be capable of translate macbinary file on the fly a they download if they know in advance they 'll be download macbinary file .image this format be normally use only for system software so that on-line user can download file that can easily be convert into exact copy of the installer floppy instead of use diskcopy to restore the image to floppy you can use steve christensen 's freeware utility mountimage to treat the image on your hard disk a actual floppy insert in a floppy drive mountimage have a reputation for be buggy so you should have some blank floppy and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case .sea .x .x .sea file do n't merit a position in the above table because they 're self-extracting they may have be create with compact pro stuffit or even diskdoubler but all should be capable of decompress themselves when double-clicked for some unknown reason alysis have chosen not to use this industry standard designation for self-extracting archive create with their payware product superdisk and more disk space instead they append either .x or .x to self-extracting archive how can i get binhex stuffit etc. 2.6 by far the easy way to get these program be to ask a human be to copy them onto a floppy for you if you 're at a university there 's absolutely no excuse for not find someone to give you a copy and if you 're anywhere less remote than mcmurdo sound chance be very good that someone at a computer center dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit once you have stuffit any version you do n't need binhex if you 're such a computer geek that the thought of actually ask a living breathing human be instead of a computer terminal for something turn you into a quiver mass of protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a work copy of stuffit from a local bulletin board system if you have religious objection to software gotten by any mean other than anonymous ftp then i suppose i 'll mention that you can in fact ftp a work copy of stuffit though this be by far the hardest way to get it ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and login type the word `` binary '' hit return type `` cd mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression '' and hit return then `` get stuffit_expander_1.0.1_sea_bin '' and hit return of course it 's always possible that by the time you read this stuffit expander will have be update and the name change so if this fails look for something similar if you 've ftp 'd straight onto your mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will produce a work copy of stuffit expander when double-clicked if you 've ftp 'd to your mainframe or unix account first you still need to use a modem program to download it to your mac just make sure that the mac be receive in macbinary mode and the mainframe be send in binary mode if you need more detail on the last step consult the faq list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manual for both your mainframe and macintosh telecommunication software how can i get binhex stuffit etc from a pc 2.7 you ca n't there be absolutely no way to get an executable macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto your mac without some software obtain by mean other than anonymous ftp you must beg borrow or steal the necessary software such a binhex or stuffit lite from another person i realize this may terrify those among you who have n't left your parent basement since you get an apple ii+ in 1980 but eventually you 're go to need to link up with some human be other than your mother though i suppose if you 're this much of a nerd you could send your mother out to get it for you while you 're gathering your nerve for a venture into the strange and terrify world of daylight please do n't bother the net by ask this question again there simply be no way to move executable macintosh program from a pc or other non-macintosh computer onto a mac without software that be not bundle with most mac ================================================================= troubleshoot what to do before post when thing go wrong 3.0 ================================================================= while the various faq list cover a lot of specific problem there be far more problem that be n't cover here these be a few basic technique you should follow before ask for help you should probably also perform the ten-step preventative maintenance routine described in section four especially rebuild the desktop 4.3 and resize the system heap 4.5 follow these step may or may not solve your problem but it will at least make it easy for others to recommend solution to you identify the problem 3.1 `` microsoft word be crash '' do n't say much what be you do when it crashed can you repeat the action that lead to the crash the more information you provide about the action precede the crash the more likely it be someone can help you the more precisely you 've identify the problem and the action precede it step 1 the easy it will be to tell if the follow step fix the problem for example `` sometimes quarkxpress 3.0 crash with a coprocessor not instal error '' be not nearly a helpful a `` quarkxpress 3.0 crash when i link two text box on a master page when copy of those text box already contain text '' the former will leave you wonder whether the bug remains after a give step the latter let you go right to the problem and see if it 's still there or not read the read me file 3.2 many company include a list of know incompatibility and bug in their read me file often these be n't document in the manual read any read me file to see if any of the problem sound familiar check for virus 3.3 run disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk virus infection be rarer than most people think but they do occur and they do cause all sort of weird problem when they do reinstall the application and all it support file 3.4 for half a dozen reason external magnetic field improperly write software the alignment of the planet a file on a disk may not contain the data it 's suppose to contain this can cause all type of unexplained unusual behavior restore from original master will normally fix this reinstall the system software 3.5 bit be even more likely to get twiddle in the system file than in the application and the effect can be just a disastrous see question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for perform a clean reinstall if the problem continue to occur after you 've take these step chance be you 've found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program so it 's time to isolate the problem 3.6 you need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself here be the basic step of isolate the cause of a system or application crash a. run only one application at a time occasionally application do conflict with each other if the problem do not manifest itself without other application run simultaneously you can begin launch other application until you find the one that cause the crash b. if you 're run system 6 turn off multifinder if you're run system 7 allot a much memory to the application a you can afford sometimes program just need more memory especially when perform complicate operation c. if you 're run system 7 turn off virtual memory and 32-bit address there 's still an awful lot of system 7 hostile software out there include some from company that really have no excuse can you say microsoft word 5.1 boy and girl i knew you could some of this software only express it incompatibility when certain uncommon action be take d. boot from a virgin system floppy if the problem disappears you likely have an init conflict you need to progressively remove extension until the problem vanishes use a little common sense when choose the first extension to remove if the problem occurs when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the standard file open procedure such a super boomerang first if the problem remains after the obvious candidate have be eliminate either remove the remain extension one at a time or if you have a lot of them perform a binary search by remove half of the extension at a time once the problem disappears add half of the most recently remove set back continue until you 've narrow the conflict down to one extension when you think you 've found the offend init restart with only that init enable just to make sure that it and it alone be indeed cause the problem contact technical support 3.7 by now you should have a very good idea of when where and why the conflict occurs if a tech support number be available for the software call it if you 're lucky the company will have a work around or fix available if not perhaps they 'll at least add the bug to their database of problem to be fix in the next release ====================== preventive maintenance 4.0 ====================== you would n't drive your car 100,000 mile without give it a tune-up a computer be no different regular tune-up avoid a lot of problem although there be mac mechanic who 'll be happy to charge you 75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change there's no reason you ca n't change it yourself the follow nine-step program should be perform about every three month trash unneeded file 4.1 many of the operation that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there be to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard disk if you 're at all like me you 'll find several megabyte worth of preference file for application you no longer have archive of software you've dearchived shareware you try out and do n't like announcement for event that have come and go and many other file you no longer need if you 're run system 7 you may also have several more megabyte in your trash can alone throw them away and empty the trash rethink your extension 4.2 some macintosh attract inits like a new suit attracts rain seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in your collection if you do n't use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up you 're probably well off not store it in your system folder where it only take up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every startup for instance if you only read pc disk once a month there 's no need to keep accesspc load all the time cut back on your extension habit can really help avoid crash rebuild the desktop 4.3 the desktop file/database hold all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that create it it let the system know what application should be launch when you open a give file and what icon it should display where depend on it size each application have one or more representative in the desktop file a application and file move on and off your hard disk the desktop file can be become bloat and corrupt think of it a a congress for your mac every so often it 's necessary to throw the bum out and start with a clean slate fortunately it 's easy to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent one warn rebuild the desktop will erase all comment you 've store in the get info box under system 7 maurice volaski 's freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comment across a rebuild commentkeeper also work with system 6 but only if apple 's desktop manager extension be also instal to rebuild the desktop restart your mac and a your extension finish load depress the command and option key you 'll be present with a dialog box ask if you want to rebuild the desktop and warn you that `` this could take a few minute '' click ok. it will take more than a few minute the more file you have the longer it will take if you 're run system 6 you may want to turn off multifinder before try to rebuild the desktop if you 're experience definite problem and not just do preventive maintenance you may want to use fifth generation's freeware init desktop reset desktop reset completely deletes the desktop file before rebuild it thus eliminate possibly corrupt data structure zap the pram and reset the clock 4.4 all mac from the original 128k thin mac to the quadra 950 contain a small amount of battery power ram to hold certain setting that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk such a which disk to boot from unfortunately this `` parameter ram '' can become corrupt and cause unexplained crash to reset it under system 7 hold down the command option p and r key while restart your mac under system 6 hold down the command option and shift key while select the control panel from the apple menu click yes when ask if you want to zap the parameter ram since you 've erase almost all the setting in the general control panel you should now reset them to whatever you want the one set that zap the pram do not erase be the date and time but since the internal clock in the macintosh be notoriously inaccurate you 'll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it anyway resize the system heap 4.5 even after rethink their extension a per step two most people still have at least half a row of icon march across the bottom of their screen every time they restart all these extension and most application too need space in a section of memory call the system heap if the system heap be n't big enough to comfortably accommodate all the program that want a piece of it they all start play king of the mountain on the system heap knock each other off to get big piece for themselves and try to climb back on after they get knock off all this fight amongst the program severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crash the mac if you 're use system 7 your macintosh will automatically resize the system heap a necessary but if you 're run system 6 it 's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extension and application by default this size be set to 128k way too small for most mac with any extension at all the system heap size be store in the normally non-editable boot block of every system disk bill steinberg 's freeware utility bootman not only let you resize your system heap but even check how much memory your heap be already use so it can tell how much need to be allocate if you 're run system 6 get bootman use it and be amaze at how infrequently your macintosh crash reinstall the system software 4.6 system file can become corrupt and fragment especially if you 've store lot of font and desk accessory inside them merely update the system software will often not fix system file corruption i recommend do a clean reinstall here 's how 1. boot from the installer floppy of your system disk 2. copy any non-standard font and desk accessory out of your system file into a temporary suitcase 3. trash the system file on your hard disk also trash the finder multifinder da handler and all other standard apple extension like control panel and chooser these will all be replace in the new installation if you 're run or instal system 7 move everything in the extension control panel and preference folder into the top level of the system folder 4. rename the system folder any name other than system folder be fine 5. double-click the installer script on your system disk then choose customize ... select the appropriate software for your model mac and printer you could do an easy install instead but that will only add a lot of extension and code you do n't need that waste your memory and disk space 6. once installation be finish move everything from the temporary folder you create in step 4 into the new system folder if you 're ask if you want to replace anything you forgot to take something out in step 3. you 'll need to replace thing individually until you find the duplicate piece 7. reinstall any font or da 's you remove in step 2 8. reboot you should now have a clean defragmented system file that take up less memory and disk space and a much more stable system overall disk utility 4.7 much like system file hard disk have data structure that occasionally become corrupt affect performance and even cause data loss apple include disk first aid a simple utility for detect and repair hard disk problem with it system disk it 's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in the directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc even if you have an earlier version you should get the late version 7.1 from ftp.apple.com and run it on all your hard disk several company have release payware disk utility that detect and repair considerably more problem than disk first aid though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything that disk first aid do the three most effective for general work be central point 's mactools deluxe 2.0 fifth generation's public utilites and symantec 's norton utility for the macintosh 2.0. a department or work group should have all of these a well a disk first aid since none of them fix everything the others do for individual mactools 48 street be about half the price of norton 94 street or public utility 98 street so feature and ease of use be roughly equal i recommend mactools all of these product occasionally encounter problem they ca n't fix when that happens it 's time to backup 4.7 and reformat 4.9 backing up 4.8 this be one part of preventative maintenance that should be do a lot more often than every three month the simplest back up be to merely copy all the file on your hard disk onto floppy or other removable medium if you keep your data file separate from your application and support file then it 's easy to only back up those folder which change frequently nonetheless every three month you should do a complete backup of your hard disk a number of program be available to make backing up easy apple include a very basic full backup application with system 6. with the performas apple ship a new apple backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder onto floppy the previously mention norton utility for the mac and mactools deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup utility that incorporate compression and incremental backup finally if you 're lucky enough to have a tape drive network server or removable medium device to use for backup you should check out the more powerful payware utility redux 49 street do n't support tape drive and diskfit pro 74 street there be no freely available backup utility other than the old hd backup from system 6. disk defragmentation 4.9 a disk fill up it get harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large file therefore the operating system will often split large file into piece to be store in different place on your hard disk a file become more and more fragment performance can degrade there be several way to defragment a hard disk the most tedious but cheapest method be to backup all your file erase the hard disk and you might a well reformat while you 're at it see question 4.10 and restore all the file a number of payware utility include norton utility for the mac and mac tool deluxe can defragment a disk in place i.e without erase it although the ad for all these product brag about their safety once you 've bought the software and open the shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something do go wrong there be no freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please do n't annoy the net by ask for one reformat your hard disk 4.10 just a a floppy disk need to be initialize before use so a hard disk must be format before it can hold data you don't need to reformat every three month but when your system be crash no matter what you try reformatting be the ultimate mean of wipe the slate clean reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabyte of space not all hard disk be create equal some can hold more data than others to facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisk 81.3 megabyte be the average format capacity your mileage may vary apple often format drive to the low common denominator of drive capacity when you reformat there 's no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space apple 's left on your disk unlike floppy hard disk need a special program to initialize them most hard disk come with format software apple 's disk and system software ship with hd sc setup a minimal disk formatter which will format apple brand hard drive only most other manufacturer ship appropriate format software with their hard drive normally this will be all you need to reformat your hard disk a number of general-purpose formatters be also available which go beyond the bundle software to include feature like encryption password protection multiple partition faster disk access system 7 compatibility and even compression two of the best be the payware drive7 and hard disk toolkit personal edition 49 street for either while there be one or two freeware formatters available none be likely to be superior to the one bundle with your hard disk powerbook user should be sure to turn off sleep and processor cycling before reformatting their hard drive no matter what software they use otherwise disk corruption crash and data loss be a very good possibility"
b"i thought i 'd share a good experience too i bought the aps quantum 240 zero footprint drive in may '92 back when they still use two separate led on the front panel and the case be metal while travel with it it be in my se/30 mac bag on top of the mac this past winter one of the plastic tab hold the front panel on broke so that the right side of the front panel be come forward away from the rest of the drive i live with this situation until it become completely intolerable which more or less coincide with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town i have to take which give me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out i call aps for an rma and get one with no question ask about how the tab get broken it be handle a little roughly by airline baggage handler -- though nothing else be damage well except for the internal speaker in my modem which be n't that well glue down to begin with -- yeah yeah i'm never fly with my se/30 again and when i call back to ask whether i could send it in a little later rather than right away they have no problem with that -- even when i exceed the normal valid period for an rma by a day they 're usually good for 10 day the front panel be replace under warranty and the drive be ship back quickly i mail it first class insured on a saturday by noon from l.a. to missouri and it come back by fed ex by friday i do n't know exactly what day it come back because i be travel that week from wednesday afternoon to sunday afternoon the only thing that could 've be bad be that the first service rep i talk to in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data suggest that i take the drive mechanism out and send just the case unfortunately i discover the day i be mail the thing that would necessitate break the little seal and thus void the warranty oh well"

b"complete why would you dispose a channel if you be go to play more sound soon if you be try to write a game you shouldn't be use sndplay instead make a channel and use buffercmds to play sound on it it work great you can add callback to the channel also to let you know when the channel be get empty before it get empty 7.1 callback be very reliable i found them 100 reliable even under system 4.1. i be do continuous background sound with interrupt sound effect on system 6.0 with the im-v documentation you probably be cancel your callback command out of your channel of course you do n't get call in general if you have problem with sound work when you play one per channel and then close the channel with the related slowdown but then when you play more than one you don't work then you be add more than one synthesizer to a channel possibly the same one multiple time this might be because you be call sndplay on a preexist channel with a sound resource which add the sample sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it play most sample sound have this command at the start of them you need to resedit the sound and remove that command then when you create your channel specify the sample sound synthesizer to be the channel 's synth then you can use asynch sndplay 's all you want you 'll probably want to switch to buffercmd 's since you be go to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callback now before you go ahead and tell me i be full of it and the sound manager do n't work for game remember spectre us it and it work great if spectre can spare the cpu time you can too one little disclaimer there be some out there who say the sound manager in the iisi ca n't be make to work right i 'm not sure either way but i know for sure that you can make your sound work 100 correctly on every other machine use the sound manager"

b"we be have a problem with a quadra 950 that have stump a couple of tech sent to u by the vendor a well a u this quadra be 'stuffed with 64mb ram 2mb vram and some large disk 400mb i think what happens be that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry 'loses vertical sync it be quite apparent that the mac cpu be still ok and the problem really seem to lie with the video circuitry since you can still save your document quit your aplpications even pull down menu etc only the display be scroll lik crazy so it's pretty hard to hit menu item we have the original logic board replace twice now and the same problem have be occur on all board although the inteval between occurrence have varied the first board have this problem every about 1hr more often if the cache be turn off yes off this be the only symptom that be not obviously related to the video circuitry after all the cache be on the cpu right the second board have the problem every about 10 minute we do not keep it rather we put the original back the current board we have have this problem a lot less often have go about a week without do it but do it twice within an hour yesterday the technician that have come out to try to figure it out seem pretty sharp and try a number of sensible thing most of which we have previously try ourselves anyway these include -swapping the ram -swapping the vram -swapping monitor 3 different 13 '' apple rgb and 2 16 '' apple rgb -swapping cable -disconnecting hd and booting from floppy -sacrificing various small mammal here be some other fact -when we put a rasterops procolor 32 on the nubus the problem be fix it do not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out -the vendor can not reproduce the problem back in their shop on the board that exhibit it in our lab -apple be say to be get a little bit piss off at shipping u board that they can not find anything wrong with and get them ship back a faulty accord to u here be some speculation -i bet that neither apple nor the vendor have test these board with that much ram and vram on them simultaneaously which may have something to do with their find it hard to reproduce the problem though we can reproduce it with just 4mb of ram so this be probably a red herring -the vendor 's representative blame 'metal in your wall claim that our wall have metal in them which interferes with the mac 's operation we have another 950 in the lab which work like a charm though it 's not in the exact same spot ... please do n't tell me this be probably it i do not want to believe it -it 's probably not poltergeist since they do not have badge to get past security at the entrance to our site have anyone any idea please please email a well a post cause i seem to be spending a lot of time reboot my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news thank you in advance carlo tiana nasa ames research center carlo vision.arc.nasa.gov"

b"i just put a 33mhz 040 cpu into my centris 610. now i have a math coprocessor but be it possible to speed up the centris to run at either 25mhz or 33mhz i do n't see any oscillator on the motherboard like the one on the iisi's motherboard where be the oscillator for the centris any idea thanks"
b"mostly the q950 do have a scsi2 controller chip a it 's scsi chip but it do not have the chip to use the wide or fast scsi-2 mode and therefore do n't offer much more in the way of scsi performance over the q900 it do howrever have a faster i/o controller than the q900 this be where the real speed boost come from"

b"here be how i modify my quadra 700 for high speed previously i have be use a variable speed overdrive for accelerate my cpu but this modification be test out a more stable at high speed your mileage may vary the top speed you achieve can not be predict before hand my personal q700 have test fine up to 32 mhz thus far i do n't have high speed clock oscillator on hand to test high speed part clock oscillator 4 pin ttl variety you will need a selection of speed begin at 50 mhz on up the cpu will run at 1/2 the oscillator speed the original one be a 50 mhz unit i recommend get a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the exist one i obtain my clock oscillator from digikey 1-800-344-4539 for less than 5.00 each some of their part number be 50 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x121 62 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x136 66 mhz ttl clock oscillator part ctx137 do n't get the half size clock oscillator they wo n't fit there be also cmos clock oscillator i have n't try one in a quadra they work fine in iisi 's socket obtain a 4 pin socket which be in the same form factor a a 14 pin dip package alternatively use 4 machine socket pin from an augat style socket just cut them out of the socket cool fan a very small 12 volt fan to keep the cpu cool be a must my vso come with a specially modify heatsink which have a fan built onto it it have a pass-through connector which tapped into the hard drive power cable you should rig up something similar or risk fry your cpu procedure 1 insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warning here 2 remove the top lid of the machine you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mount in a plastic tower follow the usual anti-static precaution and of course make sure the machine be off when you do this unplug all cable wall and monitor power supply cord from the back of the mac 3 remove the power supply by pull the plastic interlock tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pull the power supply straight up the tab be a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply you may also feel a horseshoe shape piece at the right portion of the power supply leave that alone the plastic tab from the tower be all you need release 4 look at the rear of the tower assembly you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable lead to the floppy drive disconnect all these from the motherboard the hard drive power cable connector have a tab which must be squeeze to release it 5 unplug the drive activity lead from it clear plastic mount 6 look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower a phillips head screw be at the base remove it take care not to drop it into the case a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver be helpful here 7 remove the tower assembly by pull medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower this tab prevents the tower from slide posteriorly slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case 8 remove the interrupt switch assembly it be a strangely shape plastic device at the left front edge of the motherboard pull the middle rear plastic prong up and forward the entire device will release 9 unplug the speaker cable squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case 10 remove the motherboard form the case lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm this allows it to clear the clear plastic power light guide slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm the motherboard then come directly out 11 locate the 50 mhz clock crystal it be a small metal box near the cpu chip note and remember it orientation the new clock oscillator must be align with pin 1 in the same orientation very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator some of the pin may be bent over simply desolder then unbend them be sure your desoldering iron be hot enough before heating the board i use a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task this be not appropriate for a first solder experience the motherboard be a multi-layer design with very fine trace easily damage without proper care 12 install your socket or socket pin where the old oscillator once be 13 put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket you could use the old clock but it have solder on it pin this may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problem later i suggest use a new 50 mhz clock 14 install your cool fan system to complete the modification 14 reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place 15 snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard 16 reinstall the tower assembly by first place the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 1 cm posterior of it intend position low the tower assembly into place while maintain contact with the right wall of the case once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it click into place 17 reconnect the motherboard end of the cable dont't forget the floppy drive cable 18 replace the phillips head screw 19 drop the power supply straight down into place until it click in 20 plug the hard drive activity light back into it clear plastic mount 21 reattach your cable and power cord cross your finger and turn on the mac it should make the usual power on chord if it do n't something be amiss immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork if all be not well you have my sincere condolence hopefully all will work normally turn the machine back off and replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one reboot and be astound you will need to fully test the machine for many hour before decide a particular speed be truly usable with my vso a machine lock-up might take 8 hour of operation to occur in the brief time since modify my clock oscillator 36 hour i have not have a single problem good luck to all who attempt this modification there be a small but real risk but you could well reach quadra 950 speed or high with less than 50 in part"
