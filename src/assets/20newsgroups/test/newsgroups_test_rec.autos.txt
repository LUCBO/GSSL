b"i remember the formula 's off hand a it have be awhile since i take aerodynamics and use the stuff since the cd be related to the drag force which be what effect top speed and fuel consumption when the drag force on the car or aircraft be great than what the vehicle 's engine can overcome it have reach it top speed auto of course also have to overcome roll resistance since drag opposes the vehicle 's motion the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel anyway since the geometery of an auto be rather complex the drag pressure coeffiecent etc be either found experimentaly or use a numerical method anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff be cd d/ q*2r where d be the drag force q the flow velocity and r be the radius of the clyinder to get a rough very rough estimate you can set r at 1/2 the car's width q at the car 's speed and know the cd find the drag force that the car would need to overcome"

b"be a while since review a car but today i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audis have be so overwhelm that he make a not too sucessful living sell them without far delay i will get to the 1993 audi s4 1 servotronic steer for those who be not familiar with what servotronic be it be the name for the speed variable power steer manufacture by zf and use in audis and bmws i have be outspoken in my dam of servotronic over the past couple of month and this be base on magazine review and drive of the audi 90 c quattro and the audi 100cs fwd i be quite happy to report now that on the s4 the servotronic be *inoffensive* i suppose that due to the fat gumball tire the servotronic have be load up more and this so far have be the best implementation that i have try it be far from perfect mind you and be much happier if it be an option that i could refuse but on the s4 i no longer consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car be ruin the steer be still a tad too light but it be accurate and i suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some make it through to the driver 's hand so there be feel and there be accuracy in the s4 's steer but there be also room for improvement i consider the s4 's steer to be well than the japanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe in '' feel '' and engineer it out completely 2 engine wheee what a pressure cooker with just 110 mile on the clock i do not expect the s4 to be produce anywhere close to what it will be put out 10000 mile later but still the car pack a terrific punch for a turbocharged machine it be very unusual in that it encourages lazy drive i.e low rev high gear it be so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there 's only 2.2 liter of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a fashion with maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph a chracteristic that one normally associate with large capacity v8s the technical achievement be breadthtaking throttle response be right up there with a good atmospheric engine in fact it would even put peaky multivalve engine to shame downshift be almost unnecessary it be more fun to use the `` overboost '' feature than to rev the engine for those not familiar the s4 engine feature up to 15 second of additional turbo boost for passing sort of like light up the after burner in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a few moments.. simply by floor the gas a far a the number go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoot up to about 270 lb ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter it take a few moment for it to develop overboost but it be well worth wait for since this be quite a heavy car one 's body part be not flung around like say the corrado vr6 the acceleration be smooth and strong somewhat similar to rid in a jetliner a it accelerates down the runway on takeoff also one be treat to a very distinctive and entertain whistle from the turbo.. the only entertain sound to come out of a very refine but bland sound 5 banger.. yes audi have refine the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sound a serene a it do at 2000. the smoothness be outstanding but not quite up to the standard of a very good 6 e.g a 12 valve bmw say that in term of refinement i.e willingness to rev smoothness lack of harshness under full acceleration it be well than many v6s however lose in the refinement process be the characteristic 5 cylinder bark that make the old engine so characterful if not terribly refine the 20 valve turbo 5 sound pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost subjectively rate the vw vr6 engine a be far more musical than the turbo 5.. also audi 's own v8 be also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when press though none of these can match it grunt the only hint of the engine 's true capacity occurs when one be take off from rest after the turbo have come to a near stop with the extra inertia from the permanently engage 4wd system one have to be somewhat delicate in feed in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall alternately one could use more revs.. in both case a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for this car just a they offer though in extremely small number a 5 speed for the much peakier v8 the characteristic of the engine be perfect for an automatic ironically in europe a slush be available but none be offer for the land of the slush marketing twit rear their ugly head again ... 3 chassis notice that audis tend to have very wide wheel and relatively modest tire width the car come with firestone of size 225/50 zr16.. which be not uncommon at all however the very attractive 5 spoke wheel be no less than 8 inch wide so there be no sidewall bulge whatsoever combine with the flare wheel arch the s4 have a mouth water macho yet subdue look on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body style have make significant advance in structural rigidity a well a road noise suppression.. i suppose the two be inter-related but i digress to use a cliche the s4 's body feel like it have be carve out of stone flex be totally undetectable even when go over rough road with a super rigid body like this stiff spring and stiff damper do not cause excessive harshness and while the s4 's ride quality will never worry a lexus it will also not draw comparison to truck or pony car the servotronic steer have already be mention i consider it to be inoffensive because it do not inhibit spirit corner i be able to test the car 's corner power without too much trepidation i think a new concept be at work in this car with it fat gumball tire talk about understeer or oversteer be practically meaningless on a bank highway on ramp i go in slow and start apply power a i go around i could feel the g force build to the point where the skin on my face be be tug sideways yet the car be totally and completely obedient to throttle and steer inputs.. it felt that the limit be not even close to be approach the g force be thrill but the entire affair of go around a curve be strangely uninvolving you tell the car what you want and it do it end of story i think that i be start to relate more and more to those reviewer who be highly impressed by the honda nsx 's clinical efficiency but be unable to fall in love with the car the brake have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too though read that they be prone to fade i be not too surprised since the s4 do not have uprated brake over the base audi 100 fwd harder pad would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold i be start to see a trend among the luxury/sports sedan maker where extra weight be not be offset by additional brake capacity the ls400 's fade performance be nothing to brag about neither be the q45 's or the legend 's brake fade these day seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody 's attention be focus on anti-lock capability 4 comfort for a car with such sporty ability it comfort level be also excellent the cabin be beautifully appoint with carbon-fiber panel insert in place of the wood trim of the '92 s4 all the expect gizmo be there.. heat seat power seat seat memory power this and that the glare ommision be the trip computer which be remove because audi gotten it to work reliably yet.. that mean that the car have no boost gauge a real disappointment take into account how much the turbo dominates it performance unusual for the german the s4 come with a honda style moonroof a well a the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch noise level include engine and tire noise be so low that i consider the lexus advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer 5 conclusion even though few will be able to afford an audi s4 at it sticker price of 48k the car be a bargain if one take into account what it have to offer over the competition the 20 valve turbo 5 be a real gem even if it produce ferrari sound no other luxury/sports sedan maker offer the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some be worth the extra money all by itself the safety feature be also top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags the 100 series audis have be outstanding in government crash test it get my thumb up for be so overwhelmingly capable rather than be all out excite and intoxicate"

b"review of 1989 ford taurus sho -- by gene kim ============================================= background last week i bought a 1989 ford taurus sho move up from drive a 1987 toyota celica st and a 1975 oldsmobile cutlas i have be interested in buying a sho for about five month and have be comb the classified in denver and chicago every week i bought a remarkably clean maroon/red sho with 92k mile on it for 6800 a far a i can tell this be about 2000 under blue book and i still have another 8000 mile before the extend service plan run out a one should with any pre-1991 shos i make sure that the car be already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate a well a have be recall for upgraded rotor and seatbelt attachment however my sho do not have the newer rod shifter -- i understand i can get this for 230 from any ford service center in addition the car receive the full tune-up at 60k mile receive new platinum plug and valve adjustment for a car with 92k mile on it the car be virtually immaculate the clearcoat paint job be devoid of any large chip or dent although the front air-dam/molding be cover with lot of small scratch -- not surprising since most of the mile be spent on the highway have driven a small two-door coupe for so long i be a bit concerned about whether i could get use to drive a large car to my surprise the size of the car bother me at all -- it seem just a nimble a my celica no comparison with my oldsmobile visibility from the driver 's seat be excellent help mostly by of the small the quarter-windows aft of the back-seat door window and in front of the c-pillar and rear window parallel parking be a bit more difficult but other than that i love the size in fact start to appreciate the large trunk a i pack up for a 14-hour drive to washington dc for the summer more on the ride later in this review engine a with anyone even slightly interested in shos i be very interested in the 24-valve 3.0l yamaha `` shogun '' engine i be not disappointed base performance of the engine under 4000 rpm be good you can even do reasonable launch from second gear although i make a practice of this the engine rev smoothly and eagerly -- tool around town do not require many shift this be good since the shifter be definitely one of the weak point of the car more on this later while the performance of the engine under 4000 rpm may be unremarkable it undergoes a jekyll/hyde transformation once you hit high rev at 4500 rpm a butterfly valve open and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine change a twelve more valve open up the engine soar to it 7000 rpm redline and you be treat to in my opinion the sweetest sound v6 around the engine inexplicably sound overjoyed to be at 6500 rpm notice that when i drive around town i constantly watch the tach to see how far below 4000 rpm i be to go from 2000 rpm to 4000 you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque be more than adequate it come fully online until those other 12 valve be use transmission when _car and driver_ first review the car in 1988 they marvel at how ford have put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car i remember drive a friend 's parent 's sho in 1990 and remember think about whether i have the leg strength to drive the car in traffic -- the clutch be that stiff that be back then the entire clutch assembly on my sho have be replace under a ford recall in 1991. the clutch on the sho feel no stiffer than the one on my toyota celica in fact the friction point seem a bit large and more forgive when play with the shifter with the car park the shifter felt very reasonable the 1-2 and 3-4 gate be where expect it to be and the shift action be smooth on the road much the same -- but you have to shift slowly make no mistake a clumsy shifter when hurry shift like when i be initially try to impress friend i consistently miss the 1-2 shift often grope clumsily for the 2-3 shift and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift i find this pretty amaze in a car like this it also take me several day to realize that you get the smoothest shift when you take your time seem obvious but compare to my toyota and my friend 's honda this seem atrocious and clumsy someone on rec.autos note that crxs should blow shos off-the-line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seem more reasonable when you play within these bound the shifter work smoothly with no surprise i know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all along these same line i initially have trouble shift gear smoothly again slow down the shift and take more care to match rev when let out the clutch help immensely this take several day for me to get the hang of i think some of my problem be because never have a car with enough power to balk at bad shift in high gear occasionally i have trouble shift into reverse the shifter refuse to enter the gate and i often grind the synchro try to get it into gear i 'll be watch this carefully in the next couple of month a quirk when i upshift and the engine drop back to 1000-2500 rpm i hear a whir and then a grind noise come from the the engine compartment not terribly loud but the passenger can definitely hear it i ask about it when i be look at the car a do all my passenger apparently this be a definitely a `` sho sound '' and be the gearbox -- apparently call `` gear rollover '' reply to my query on rec.autos be at the end of this review exterior a i mention before i be astound by how well the body of this sho have stood up paint chip on the front bumper and grille be virtually non-existent look at how old tauri sometimes age so gracefully i wonder what the guy at ford do differently to the sho body the body in my opinion be extremely attractive with match color body molding than the stock tauri for some odd reason the sho seem different enough from vanilla tauri to get stare at stoplight -- of course this could be my overactive imagination shos get fog light a more open grille a completely monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with '' sho '' stencil in relief see a couple shos whose owner have color these in with florescent color or in black yuck i think the car be flashy i like it that way i feel almost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different and distinctive enough to those of u who care interior the interior be what really make me feel like i deserve the car the seat be grey leather the steer wheel and shifter be cover with black leather and the entire instrument panel be do in a black/grey/metallic scheme the instrumentation be stock taurus except for the 140 mph speedo and 8000 rpm tach you get a center console with two cupholders a large compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrest that contains yet another compartment three appropriately size coin holder for tollways i think and a compartment for hold cassette tape there 's map-holders in the door and an oddly small glove compartment i spill a whole can of coke in the cupholder and be delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be remove and wash in a sink hey really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that go into it design and a 1989 before the interior be upgraded the backseat be big than any car have why do they need so much space no smart-ass comment please the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolster from what i hear not uncommon for the side bolster to show wear mine be no exception the left side bolster on the driver 's have crack and not convince the right bolster be inflate all the way a big surprise for me i forgot that shos have a normal hand parking brake instead they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot too bad again get use to it but it seem a bit anachronistic to me ride the suspension be nice and stiff too stiff stiffer than any car have a friend 's new 1993 toyota celica st seem tauter and be still able to soak up bump well the sho seem stiffer with less ability to soak up bump drive over railroad track be a noisy and jarring affair on the other hand take turn feel wonderful because the body be so rigid and flex at all -- i listen for that before i bought the car on the highway the ride be great when i drove the car from chicago back to purdue i have trouble keep under 85 mph let alone from try to see what 100 mph really feel like a relatively quiet ride but the sunroof rattle try to find out what exactly make all the noise up there but it seem to be the window that rest on the rail no easy way to get rid of it i think over the past three day oscillate between think the suspension be wonderful and perfect and think that the ride be way too rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i would advise my dad to buy one for himself but discover a with the shifter if you take your time with shift have no reason to complain let me explain ... the ride be bad when turn and apply lot of power to the wheel i feel the wheel scrabble for traction and torque steer make the car skitter left and right after i understood this i avoid the limit of traction -- and a happy camper again not body rigidity but the composure of the car a if match the suspension the steer feel be quite heavy my first impression of drive my sho be how hard you have to turn the wheel at highway speed it track straight a an arrow but when drive around a parking lot the high-effort steer seem so useful however reasonable but it communicate the road to the driver a well a a 1993 ford probe gt imho much well than the steer on my celica st. i wonder how bad this car be during winter miscellaneous note gripe the rattle from the sunroof be intermittent -- some day it rattle loudly other day i look up wonder where all the noise go activate the sunroof be sometimes very noisy -- loud squeal a it retracts on it rail i wonder if there be a quick fix for this again other day it completely disappears function of humidity once i make the connection between the sometimes awful feel suspension and torque steer never complain about ride i wish the seat have more support under the thigh also i wish the side bolster would close more tightly i hear that tire for this car can get really expensive i currently have goodyear gt+4s that cost the previous owner 500 for four i use to hate the ford stereo system -- whose idea be it to use a volume *paddle* now to my amazement i really mind ... and sometimes think an okay idea pretty ridiculous though get up to 4000 rpm sometimes seem to be a chore but this be no big deal there be more than enough torque down low i often goof up the shift when drive with friend it take me a couple of day before i could really shift smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear hard to believe it my car have almost 93,000 mile on it my parent note that it be almost impossible to find a low-mileage sho astute observation imho i wonder how long i can make my sho last -- i just bought a book title `` drive it forever '' for tip in this department the goofy parking brake pedal still throw me for a loop i once park the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch after i start it the car jolt forward and bounce off the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all but start the car be a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal also i begin to wonder how strong that brake really be today i back out of parking spot today and start to drive away before i notice the glow brake light oops the driver 's power window creak when close all the way the same thing happens in my parent 1989 mercury sable oddly all the other window work smoothly like like the interior amenity more and more each day the cupholders be great i expect to use the keyless entry button so much but it really be handy you can lock all the door by press the 7/8 and 9/10 button together neat and you can never lock yourself out of the car i really feel like i deserve this car i really believe that i could afford it i get this car ten year ahead of schedule i love this car so much that be tell my parent to look into buying one i love this car so much that i write this 13k file -- i meant to write a couple of line and end up with this if there be a j.d power survey for use car owner i would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of own this car i like think about get another car but at this point in time sure buy another sho for under 7000 you beat it next time with an airbag and ab though insurance-wise this car be also a big win i pay the same premium a on my 1987 toyota celica -- despite that it have nearly twice the horsepower other odds and end much to my amazement there be no sho mail list anywhere maybe because the _sho registry_ publication have fill this void i join yet but notice that query about shos still appear on rec.autos about once a month owner of shos be always quick to respond and be very vocal fan of the car maybe some of the most vocal on rec.autos put together the response to my question about the car a well a other post with useful information on these car i 'll be post this in the form of a faq soon if anyone be interested in start a mail list please speak up i know if i have the resource here at purdue to start one but maybe someone out there do"

b'pretty complex and cd the whole story either cd for car be usually calculate base on the frontal area of the car so a large car with a good cd could get the same drag force a a small car with a poorer cd to calculate drag use this formula d 1/2 rho v^2 cd s where d be the drag force lb rho be the local air density slugs/ft^3 v be the velocity ft/s and s be the frontal area ft^2 note that the piece call 1/2 rho v^2 be sometimes call qbar or dynamic pressure a fancy aero term for air pressure or force note that power be p f v where p be power lbf-ft/s f be the force drag in this case lbf and v be velocity ft/s note that if you put the whole equation into one by substitute d for force you get a velocity _cubed_ term why huge increase in power result in little increase in speed ditto for decrease in cd so if you have a 100 mph car and reduce cd from .34 to .33 your new top speed be sound of trumpet fanfare 101 mph sorry to dissappoint'

b"i have this same alarm instal in my syclone it work great the shock sensor be very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i have on my other car it trigger if the car be rock gently by the wind but any kind of shock set it off even kick the tire set it off it work great the shock sensor be adjustable and there be two cycle on it you can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there be no way you could open the hood without set off the alarm although i know that you can not pop the hood on the syclone without set off my alarm now and yet i have have zero none false alarm with this system the alarm tell you when you disarm it whether it have be activate in your absence i have be able to trace every alarm to cause and it be not a false alarm i guess it would be possible depend on the vehicle my syclone be so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this there be supplemental power supply you can put on with this viper alarm but i have one i really think that if someone want my car that bad the alarm keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply this be primarily for convertible i have a convertible and have look at this feature in detail alpine actually make a well radar unit if you want to get one of these it have zone in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car have pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pull it in tighter i see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on avoid the voice alarm that can be add to the radar package it talk to people a they walk by i saw one instal on a lotus esprit the kid would taunt it see how close they could get before it 'warned them to get back the owner finally disabled it which defeat the purpose in my mind i be real happy with my viper one other feature i really like be you can tune it to your preference you can have it arm passively or not you can disable the chirp for arming/disarming you can have it lock/unlock the door when the alarm be armed/disarmed i like these feature i hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms so mine flash the light only i like the door lock feature although i have to be careful to take my key with me because it know if you have left your key in the car when it passively arm and lock the door but if you be meticulous about take your key with you it take care of the rest i look seriously at the alpine system too it be a real nice system but more money and it have a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor the shock sensor be well ... .and the viper shock sensor be well 2 cycle than the optional alpine one imho i think the viper give you a lot of good value for the money but it absolutely tamperproof no system be except maybe the one that james bond have on his lotus in for your eye only anyone know where we can get one of those instal maybe that be what they have in the van in the world trade center huh"

b"on the subject of the upcoming new mustang the car magazine have print a lot of information about the new mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my `` car circle '' be that the suspension piece and tune will be almost identical to the current cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve it behavior after the mn12 thunderbird cost and weight debacle ford decide independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive be try again in a volume car the current 4.9l v-8 will soldier on for about two year a version of the 32 valve modular v-8 in the mark viii could be offer then ford be spending big money tool up for 2.5l and 3.5l v-6 engine which will power most of their car in the immediate future and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp v-8 engine a priority undisguised the car look ok but not nearly a excite a the new camaro/firebird imo i suspect ford will produce their car with high quality than gm will achieve with the camaro/ firebird the way gm loses money the temptation to `` just get them out the door '' for the sake of positive cash flow will be great once demand really take off"

b"i have have my probe look at twice by my local dealer where i purchase the car ... the first time they make this problem bad the second time after advise them of the service bulletin mention on my ford-probe mail list they say they know of the bulletin they adjust the window and make it *much* well however it now make a `` scritch scritch '' noise on rough road and *still* squeal when i open/close the window in wet weather anyone el 's do this i get two key with my car but only one remote-entry push-button thingie but then i bought my 93 with 2500 mile and i think it may have be a repossession ... so not surprised something be miss i be seriously consider follow the advice in the owner manual where it describes the procedure to follow if `` you discover something on your ford that could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten life ... etc something about notify the national traffic safety group a well a ford those little '' -got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep '' button be terrible well i guess good in a way but in a way bad when someone hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big american car they may not associate the sound with a small `` jap car '' style car like the probe be the mudflaps help a lot i have always be a 5-speed guy almost every car ever own have be a 5-speed because i get a good deal on this car with the 2500 mile i knowingly overlook the fact that it have an automatic but it be a pretty high-tech automatic it be a fully electronicaly control 4-speed with torque converter lockup even with the automatic get 35 mpg on the highway drive 65-70 but of course drive 65 be illegal so i probably make that sentence up around town the mileage have be around 25-27 not bad for an automatic of course it have the '' control '' of a 5-speed but since i do a lot of city drive it turn out to be very convenient nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time although that too be illegal here in '' we-like-to-control-your-life massachusetts '' shake and rattle have be my main gripe gotten them to fix the bad of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattle when it get old on my 89 probe gl i get about 40k out of the original goodyear and have driven the replacement tire bridgestone 50k mile when i tradeed the car the 195/65 60 vr14 firestone on my 93 probe look like design for performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc so they probably last a long but the car handle very very very well it stick to the road like glue even on a rough surface definitely ford/mazda do a very very nice job on this one the car have a `` much more expensive than it actually be '' look and feel to it have driven an 89 probe for 4 year i find the 93 suspension `` interest '' the car actually drive much well than the 89 ... it be a very firm ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road yet the car remains very civilize on even the bumpiest road you hear and feel the bump yet the car retains it posture very well well i encourage passenger-carrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat like to sit with his knee to the dash a mention in the consumer report write-ups `` consider the back seat a a parcel shelf '' no biggie to me though if it have be not have bought the car but definitely not a family car a/c be a must on any probe from 89 93. the 93 in particular sends out a real blast of cool air when the ac be on max that `` lot of glass '' you mention be what give the car the `` very good visibility '' report you see in all the write-ups most `` sports/sporty '' car have that good visibility the complaint heard re exhaust system on 93 's have be on the gt of course be a different engine that be a differeent exhaust system i be one of those with an 89 who qualify for the free replacement since i have already replace the muffler when i receive the notice i was/am due a refund from ford i apply in february and be still wait yes i be pretty amaze when i have my car in for some touch-up adjustment this past week and they have to keep it overnight too busy for them to get to it and they offer to pay for a rental they do make me pay for tax and insurance though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design be sound and expect it to do very well"
