b"this discussion on `` objective '' seem to be fall into solipsism eg the recent challenge from frank dwyer for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomenon someone even make the statement that science be '' subjective '' and that even atom be `` subjective '' this be get a bit silly and the word `` objective '' be lose all meaning let start by remember the definition of `` objective '' which have be already present objective adj 1. of or have to do with a material object a distinguish from a mental concept 2. have actual existence 3.a unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice b. base on observable phenomenon the objectivity of a thing be not base on whether everyone agrees on that thing eg the world be objectively round regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers but rather whether it be base observable and verifiable phenomenon instead of be base solely on people wish feel mental process etc thus atom be base on very observable and repeatable phenomenon be indeed consider to be objective rather than subjective even weird high energy physic be base on observable phenomenon even though that observation can change the outcome nor be those observable phenomenon affected by emotion or personal prejudice eg chemical reaction do not change to the whim of different people thus to say that science be not objective ie objectively verifiable be a bit silly a that be the point of science now i will agree that science be not objectively `` good '' i will not thereby conclude though that science be not objective now some example thing which be `` objective '' a d-12 tractor be large than the average breadbox chlorophyll be green seawater contains salt there exists ozone in the atmosphere at least presently ozone block ultraviolet light ultraviolet light increase the incident of skin cancer `` good '' on the other hand be a value judgement it seem to have an existence apart from what we give it unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which have define `` good '' we can not quantify it touch it or collect it in any concrete sense eg i have a bag full of `` good '' now we do sometimes attempt to give the word `` good '' an objective meaning e.g `` good '' have be use to denote strength resiliency speed etc that though be a subjective definition a some might not see '' strength '' and etc a necessarily `` good '' eg strength inspire by naziism be not generally view a `` good '' a to a morality i can not say that i have ever see a morality strictly base on verifiable observable phenomenon the closest i have see be some form of the `` golden rule '' which concludes that it be best not to deliberately piss people off a they will likely then involve themselves in your life in a manner you like this be verifiable when you `` get in someone 's face '' they will often retaliate another objective fact about morality be that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group and thus can at time ignore that form of the `` golden rule '' without fear of reprisal now a to whether this enforce of morality be `` good '' or `` bad '' be quite subjective by the way remember that subjective do not mean that a thing can not be formally state or even commonly agree upon it only mean that that it be not verifiable from observable phenomenon or have a physical existence unto itself also note that i have not state that there be no such thing a an objective morality or that i could not accept any such a morality i have simply state that i have see no evidence of any such morality one other thing to notice `` objective '' be many time use a synonymous with '' true '' and/or `` absolute '' and `` subjective '' sometimes have the connotation of '' false '' and/or `` relative '' tai n't necessarily so for instance when a conclusion be base on objective but insufficient evidence then it can be both objective and false a to `` absolute '' it be easy to note that while we can objectively show that tnt be explosive but that do not absolutely mean that all tnt will explode and thus objective be not necessarily absolute either on the other hand something subjective can also be either '' absolutist '' or `` true '' for instance there be some theist who be specifically `` absolutist '' in their morality even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up far many a scientist and detective have be motivate by subjective reason eg a `` gut feel '' or `` hunch '' to investigate a phenomenon or situation and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis on the whole though i would have to agree that objective evidence be much more trustworthy than subjective evidence later dave butler"

b"why should anyone check let 's restrict this to christian why do *we* want to find `` commandment '' in the book regard a scripture what's go on i will pas on psychologizing answer whether dismissive or more open a not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question be what be the *theological* point involve and it have be quote `` at '' me often enough by those who believe i take it seriously that jesus be say to have say `` if you love me you will obey my command '' john 14:15 i be like any christian the slave of christ and it be my will that i should do a he will me to do i be also or instead his young brother but still under his direction though we both call god `` abba '' christian therefore will try to find what it be that their lord command them and discover it will feel obligate to do it or to confess their failure reader here may set aside the theologize jargon such a `` slave of christ '' -- the point be that adherent of a religion *will* read the text whether classify a `` inspire '' or not that be held up a model in an effort to find application to their own situation this practice range from `` devotional '' reading of sermon and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture a `` the word of god '' and at the high pitch this lead to a question of whether we *can* find in inspire scripture something that can act a `` absolute '' guidance for our action the problem be in find out just *what* it be our lord command i be go to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christian have look for these command namely christian tradition that be not because *i* reject tradition but because my primary audience in this essay be protestant who deny tradition a determinative value in favor of the witness of scripture the question i want to deal with be what commandment can we find from our lord in scripture and that turn out to be a hard question if any of my protestant inquisitor would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition i can accomodate them unlike *most* protestant episcopalian admit claim from a scripture b reason and c tradition on roughly equal stand earlier in john than my quote above we read john 13:34 `` i give you a new commandment love one another '' this be the only place in the nt where christian be give an explicit commandment with the context comment on it imperative mode pronouncement by jesus at the same meal so we *readers* infer since it be *not* in john but in the synoptics jesus say `` take this bread this be my body '' mark 14:22 cf matthew 26:26 luke 22:19 1 corinthian 11:24 the mode be imperative greek _labete_ and hence this too be a `` commandment '' in *both* case we have to *infer* that the command be direct to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciple -- because we judge the evangelist 's point in mention it with the disciple by then mostly or entirely dead be that *we* be expect to follow this a a commandment from our lord in the case of communion paul 's mention at least this be probably true of the evangelist also implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these word operate to `` bind '' christian to the original command to his disciple a a continue commandment to the christian community i be entirely comfortable with this inference but i *must* point out that it be there between u and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command i take it a a clear inference at the very least the evangelist 's notion that *all* christian be call to love one another in jesus command direct at the disciple but i have to call attention to the inference the command can not apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of it statement to my own context a a `` disciple '' of christ all reading of scripture have to make such inference to get any sense out of the text whatsoever this be a general problem in reading these text -- we can not read them at all without our *own* understand of our native language in which we normally read the translate text and without *some* appreciation of the original context and at point the original language when english misleads u i be go to presume in what follow that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control i *really* think this be true but it will suffice for my current purpose i will address only the issue that arise when we have already coped with the understand of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in question at that level only introduce more reser- vations about the commandment issue than will be found stipulate that we can read the text a the original audience might have do among the reason we have for see john 's _agapate allelou_ a a *general* commandment not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciple on that one occasion and one link it to the synoptic `` great commandment '' be that we have criticism from jesus about limit our love to those whom we congenially associate with in matthew 5:43ff we read `` you have learnt say to you love your enemy '' in fact the leviticus context quote do not say 'hate your enemy -- it be merely the common human presumption and leviticus be at pain to say that the `` love '' should extend to stranger amongst the people of israel luke in expand on this same q context go on to have jesus say `` even sinner love those who love them '' 6:27 all of this suggests quite strongly say that *limiting* the scope of the `` new commandment '' be not quite what jesus have in mind in short inference *leads me* to generalize the actual text to a command that be `` in force '' on christian and with object not limited to other christian trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or institution of communion there be the case of the `` great commission '' where matthew 10 mark 6 the twelve be sent out to evangelize `` proclaim that the kingdom of heaven be close at hand '' the verb be imperative _ke russete_ but the context be rather specific to the twelve and there be far specifier a in `` do not turn your step to pagan territory and do not enter any samaritan town '' -- the lukan parallel be even more specific to jesus final journey to jerusalem which make it harder to see this generalize to all christian than the previous example that prevent christian from make such an inference what i have to call attention to be that such inference be not justified in the text nor unlike the first two case i cite by the rhetoric of the evangelist urge on the reader still paul seem to have felt oblige to `` proclaim that the kingdom of heaven be close at hand '' even contrary to jesus instruction to the 12 to the gentile to the end of the earth so christian after him have also take this a a `` commandment '' in the sense of john 14:15. do i `` accept '' this i know it be surely rather speculative but you see how the ripple of inference spread out from the text that be the pretext -- christian may infer a general commandment applicable to all from what be present in the gospel a a specific occasion i do not necessarily object to this kind of generalization -- but i *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understand that they be *reasoning* at some considerable length from what we actually *have* in scripture there be *assumptions* involve in this reason and *these* be *not* themselves scriptural though people will do their best to `` justify '' their assumption by other reference to scripture -- which simply add more inference into the mix let 's move on to the `` great commandment '' -- that we should love god with our whole heart and mind and soul this be perhaps the synoptic '' equivalent '' of john 's _agapate allelou_ and yet it be not present a a commandment in our text rather the context be controversy with the pharisee to cite matthew 22:34ff '' but when the pharisee heard that he have silence the sadducee they get together and to disconcert him one of them put a question '' master which be the great commandment of the law '' it be by no mean obvious here though i accept it a such that jesus' answer be meant to be a commandment *to christians* he be answer a polemic from his enemy mark 's account in 12:28-34 cast the answer in a far more positive light a so the `` scribe '' in this version say '' far more important than any holocaust i need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice forget the nazi for this or sacrifice '' luke be intermediate -- he have a lawyer pose the question '' to disconcert '' jesus and get the good samarian parable for his pain luke 10:25-37 the context here be so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for draw *no* inference in *no* account be this say a if it be obviously to be take a a commandment binding on christian -- though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus think it to be so the point be that our mental gear have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we be command to do by jesus and all of this be contingent on our understand the point of jesus use of the torah in the all quite different gospel account and the application of such a context to *us* the different context among the synoptics be curious it should be note that only in luke do we get the `` fix '' of this command by the parable of the good samaritan we may look for an analogous *intent* in matthew where 7:12 give the `` golden rule '' a `` the meaning of the law and the prophet '' and where we may also hear an echo of hillel say the same a generation before jesus if we make these association which i think be entirely reasonable we be -- again -- indulge in inference the text do not *explicitly* support u rather we *read* the text a have this kind of inter-relationship current literary theory call this `` intertextuality '' my discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ `` have '' to apply beyond the community of the disciple and beyound the circle of christian believer applies again here to buttress a conclusion that this *is* despite the presentation not say so explicitly a `` commandment '' to christian few christian would disagree with my conclusion -- but i *must* point out that they *are* conclusion they *depend* on rather elaborate chain of reason that be simply not present in the text themselves the contextual problem keep come up more and more severely a we look at those saying of jesus that be not so universally take by christian a commandment and we get some really hard case take divorce mark be pretty clear `` the man who divorce his wife and marries another be guilty of adultery against her '' 10:11 cf luke 16:18 -- except that matthew have an escape clause `` except in the case of fornication '' 5:31 this seem to be a rather clear `` commandment '' whether or not we take matthew's reservation and some christian to this day take it so but some at least in practice this be rather peculiar it be not a if jesus be not explicit about this whereas he say nothing at all about some of the thing people gnash their teeth over how be it possible if the command of christ be clear that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelist of the synoptic tradition go to continue this examination into ever-murkier water but this be enough to start with the theme be `` find commandment in scripture be an exercise in inference our inference be inform by our assumption that be our own cultural bias '' i have so far identify a very few '' commandment '' that be generally accepted by all christian -- and yet in these already some of the difficulty start to surface it be these difficulty i want to discus in my next essay on this topic the divorce commandment already strike at some of the difficulty i see almost no evidence that the people who be so eager to find commandment to condemn *me* with spend any time at all write nasty screed to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horror or viciousness of divorce or demand that u law refuse to allow it or refuse `` unrepentant divorcee '' place in their church that be not to say that divorce ** enter into consideration in general -- it be most definitely a matter of concern in even the most `` liberal '' church circle for example a wildly liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence in a wildly liberal diocese have recommend to a couple who approach him to marry them that they have a '' private '' secular ceremony before a judge so that the `` public '' ceremony he celebrate need not go through an agonize `` examination '' by official who would just a soon not take on this role of interpret the command we be face with a christian this in a church that be effectively create by a famous divorce"
b"-* -- -- far from be `` toss out '' the gospel be take almost universally a the primary source of information about jesus i be curious a to whom mike cobb be refer who `` toss out '' the new testament undoubtedly a few *naive* atheist do this but the phrasing of the question above seem to suggest that cobb ascribes this more broadly perhaps the question that get more to the heart of the matter be why except for some *naive* believer who unfortunately far outnumber nonbeliever both naive and critical be the gospel *not* take a `` gospel truth '' that faithfully record just what happen two thousand year ago this have an easy answer and the answer have *nothing* to do with miracle no text be take this way by a critical reader there be a myth among some naive believer that one take a text measure it by some set of criterion and then either confirms the text a `` historically valid '' or `` toss out '' the text i suspect this myth come from the way history be present in primary and secondary school where certain text be vested with authority and from writer such a josh mcdowell who pretend to present historical argument along these line for their religious program in fact most text use in primary and secondary school history class ought to be toss out even the well such text should not be treat a authoritatively a descibed above and josh mcdowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice let me present the barest outline of a different view of text and their use in study history first all text be historically valid all text or to put this another way i have never see a notion of `` historical validity '' that make any sense when apply to a text second no text should be read a tell the `` gospel truth '' about historical event in the way that many student be wont to read history text in primary and secondary school no text this include your favorite author 's history of whatever every text be a historical fact every text be write by some person or some group of people for some purpose hence every text can serve a historical evidence the question be what can we learn from a text of what interest thing if any do the text provide evidence the diary of the follower of the maharishi formerly of oregon be historical evidence the gospel be historical evidence the letter of the officer who participate in the vampire inquest in eastern europe be historical evidence the modern american history textbook that whitewash `` great american figure '' be historical evidence these be all historical evidence of various thing they be *not* much evidence at all that the maharishi formerly of oregon could levitate that jesus be resurrect that vampire exist or that `` great american figure '' be a squeaky clean a we learn in school they be well evidence that some people `` saw '' the maharishi late of oregon levitate that some of the early christian thought jesus be resurrect that many people in eastern europe '' saw '' vampire return from the grave and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history how do one draw causal connection and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces this be a very complex question that have no easily summarize answer there be many book on the subject or various part of the subject i enjoy david hackett fischer 's `` historian 's fallacy '' a a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it be so easy to read text present history relatively cheap easy to read give it a try"

b"can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when question the truth of his scripture or will he assume the superstition of his parent when question often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wonder about god and his scripture see it in the christian the jew the muslim and the other theist alike all assume that their mother and father be right in the aspect that a god exists and with that belief search for their god occasionally the theist may switch religion or aspect of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some `` creator '' be behind the universe 's existence know muslim who be once christian and vice versa know christian who be once jewish and vice versa and even know christian who become hindu yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they 've kept this belief in some form of high `` be '' why it usually all have to do with how the child be brought up from the time he be born the theist be brought up with the notion of the `` truth '' of some kind of scripture -- the bible the torah the qur'an etc he be told of this wondrous god who write or inspire the scripture of the prophet talk about in the scripture of the miracle perform etc he be also told that to question this a child be apt to do be a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip- ture 's truth be to damn one 's soul to hell thus by the time he be able to read the scripture for himself the belief in it `` truth '' be so ingrain in his mind it all seem a matter of course but it stop there once the child be able to read for himself there be an endeavor to inculcate the child the `` right '' reading of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant reading to gloss over the bad one and to explain away the unexplainable with `` mystery '' circular argument `` self-evdent '' fact and `` truth '' unreasoning belief and fear of hell be the meat of religion the child must eat of every day to doubt of course mean wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concern god all of this have some considerable effect on the child so that when he becomes an adult the superstition be taught be nearly impossible to remove all of this lead me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when question god hell heaven the angel soul and all of the rest can he for a moment put aside this notion that god *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view obviously most theist can somewhat especially when present with `` mythical god '' homeric roman egyptian etc. but can they put aside the assumption of god 's existence and question it impartially stephen _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ atheist _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ libertarian _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ pro-individuality _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ pro-responsibility _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ jr. and all that jazz ..."

b"brian ceccarelli write me kent sandvik responds i think i see where you be come from kent jesus view guilt like our modern venacular color it `` feeling '' have nothing to do with guilt feeling arise from the state of be guilty feel and guilt be mutally exclusive feeling be a reaction from guilt jesus be talk about the guilt state not the reaction let me give you an example have you ever make a mistake have you ever lie to someone even a little white lie have you ever claimed to know something that you really know have you ever hat someone have you ever be selfish be you guilty of any one of these the answer be of course yes you be guilty period that be it what jesus be get at no big surprise feeling do not even enter the picture consider jesus 's use of the word '' guilt '' a how a court us it jesus be concerned that everyone should admit that they be guilty of be imperfect the bible call it the state that we be all sinner we all do bad thing even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong be proof of our guilt that we be all sinner it be it in our nature to do bad thing we be sinner therefore we do bad thing be a sinner be fact it be not a pleasant fact but it be just a fact we be not perfect call u sinner should have no more emotional charge to you than call you a human be guilty a charge you can handle your guilt in one of two way acknowledge you make a mistake learn from it and try to not do it again -- in the meantime not punish yourself for it which be the way jesus want you to handle or it this be the healthy way or two the destructive way put yourself down slap yourself and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to say a thousand hail mary even to suicide this the way jesus do not want u to deal with it all people fall into this category to some extent in their life jesus be not in the business of save u from this guilt feel jesus be in the business of show u how much he love u despite our guilt jesus know we be guilty that new to him it be no big deal to him he just want you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him that be what he want you to know why because he want to have your company you be immensely valuable to him jesus want a relationship with you however in our present sinful nature we be incapable of have this relationship god be perfect we be not you can not fit a square peg into a round hole however god have provide a way for u to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him god have provide jesus so that whosoever just believe in jesus will have their nature change the holy spirit will move it and now divine nature be now within life our very be -- and u and god communicate with each through his unify holy spirit the benefit of this be endless for with the divine nature living within u we can now see our imperfection well we can now head them off at the pas with the power of the holy spirit living in u we now have his power to help u overcome our shortcoming because the divine nature life within u we can now understand profound bible passage that never before we could understand because the divine nature now life within u we now have authority over demonic force and lastly because the divine nature now life within u we have eternal life -- for the holy spirit be eternal the relationship with jesus be of the utmost importance because it be not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom it be your relationship to the living god remember what jesus say at the tail end of matthew when he separate the `` goat from the sheep '' many people in the last day will ask him `` i prophesy in your name and do miracle and do good thing in your name '' and what do jesus say `` depart from me for i never *knew* you '' that be the cornerstone of christianity kent jesus must know you a his friend it be your relationship to jesus if he be your friend and you be his you will be count among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven good it show that you have a strong self-image -- that you love yourself that be the second great commandment jesus taught if only more people could do a you do a i say before in the common english venacular `` feel guilty '' have a different meaning than the state of guilt i believe what we all need in our personality be a lot less ego a lot less self-centeredness and a lot more unconditional love"

b"first and foremost i honestly do not believe that jesus be anything more than a man who live and die two thousand year ago i know your bible provide wonderful story of the thing he say and do but i simply do not believe that he still exists a an entity that have any bearing on this universe or the life in it and i similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or have ever exist period i view religion in general and christianity in specific a a 'cultural virus that have be pass down from generation to generation because people be often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate so they brainwash themselves and their child into believe the popular myth and it go on from there and eventually christianity becomes a give -- if so many other people believe in it it must be right no i believe in any `` life after death '' i believe that when i die i die so therefore up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime i believe that a good thing to humble myself and view pride a a sin -- pride in moderation be a constructive thing i see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about woman and my priest lose a lot of my trust when they patronizingly try to explain the 'faults of these opinion to me i believe in 'loving everyone especially people never met while i try to show respect to everyone my love and admiration be something not easily earn and i do not feel guilty about deny my respect and consideration to someone who have abuse it if you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously stop try to show me how the bible `` make sense '' start try to show me that this jesus person be somehow still influence anyone 's life here on earth"

b"the follow partial summary of a theory of the universe include a little-known description of the creation of our solar system larsonian astronomy and physic orthodox physicist astronomer and astrophysicist claim to be look for a `` unified field theory '' in which all of the force of the universe can be explain with a single set of law or equation but they have be systematically ignore or suppress an excellent one for 30 year the late physicist dewey b. larson 's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he call the `` reciprocal system '' be built on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 `` the physical universe be compose entirely of one component motion exist in three dimension in discrete unit and in two reciprocal form space and time '' 2 `` the physical universe conforms to the relation of ordinary commutative mathematics it magnitude be absolute and it geometry be euclidean '' from these two postulate larson developed a complete theoretical universe use various combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational- rotational motion the concept of in-ward and out-ward scalar motion and speed in relation to the speed of light which larson call `` unit velocity '' and `` the natural datum '' at each step in the development larson be able to match object in his theoretical universe with object in the real physical universe photon sub-atomic particle incomplete atom charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar etc even object not yet discover then such a explode galaxy and gamma-ray burst and apply his theory to his new model of the atom larson be able to precisely and accurately calculate inter- atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of this be described in good detail with-out fancy complex mathematics in his book book of dewey b. larson the follow be a complete list of the late physicist dewey b. larson 's book about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early book be out of print now but still available through inter-library loan `` the structure of the physical universe '' 1959 `` the case against the nuclear atom '' 1963 `` beyond newton '' 1964 `` new light on space and time '' 1965 `` quasar and pulsar '' 1971 `` nothing but motion '' 1979 a 9.50 substitute for the 8.3 billion `` super collider '' the last four chapter explain chemical bonding `` the neglect fact of science '' 1982 `` the universe of motion '' 1984 final solution to most all astrophysical mystery `` basic property of matter '' 1988 all but the last of these book be publish by north pacific publisher p.o box 13255 portland or 97213 and should be available via inter-library loan if your local university or public library have each of them several of them include the last one be available from the international society of unified science isus 1680 e. atkin ave. salt lake city utah 84106. this be the organization that be start to promote larson 's theory they have other related publication include the quarterly journal `` reciprocity '' physicist dewey b. larson 's background physicist dewey b. larson be a retire engineer chemical or electrical he be about 91 year old when he die in may 1989. he have a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to compute chemical property base only on the element use larson 's lack of a fancy `` ph.d. '' degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore him but it be not a valid reason sometimes it take a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the tree at the same time it be clear from his book that he also knew orthodox physic and astronomy a well a any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction ad hoc assumption principle of impotence in-consistencies etc.. larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it be not necessary for him to do so he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researcher experimental and observational data and in many case his explanation fit well a self-consistent theory be much more than the orthodox physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for a `` unified field theory '' that work but have be ignore one for over 30 year now `` modern physic '' do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of larson 's book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that `` epicycle '' `` crystal sphere '' `` geocentricity '' `` flat earth theory '' etc. also once seem to explain it well but be later prove conceptually wrong prof. frank h. meyer professor emeritus of uw-superior was/is a strong proponent of larson 's theory and be or still be president of larson 's organization `` the international society of unified science '' and editor of their quarterly journal `` reciprocity '' he move to minneapolis after retire `` super collider '' boondoggle i be against contruction of the `` superconducting super collider '' in texas or anywhere else it would be a gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of `` scientific '' value most physicist realize it but accord to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b. larson a described in his book the strange goofy particle `` meson '' `` hyperon '' allege `` quark '' etc which they be find in exist collider fermi lab cern etc be really just atom of anti-matter which be create by the high-energy collide beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment a large and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti-matter that the physicist have not see there before and the physicist will be even more confuse than they be now be a few more type of anti-matter atom worth the 8.3 billion cost we have much more important us for this waste money another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in texas have a serious and grow problem with some kind of `` fire ant '' eat the insulation off underground cable how much poison of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the `` supercollider '' name the `` super collider '' after ronald reagon a propose be totally absurd if it be built it should be name after a lead particle physicist larsonian anti-matter in larson 's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti-matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it have more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which larson call `` unit velocity '' and the `` natural datum '' in larson 's theory a positron be actually a particle of matter not anti-matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in larson 's theory the anti-matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury have be observe and precisely measure to advance at the rate of 574 second of arc per century 531 second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet venus earth jupiter etc. the remain 43 second of arc be be use to help `` prove '' einstein 's `` general theory of relativity '' but the late physicist dewey b. larson achieve result closer to the 43 second than `` general relativity '' can by instead use `` special relativity '' in one or more of his book he apply the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally reject `` general relativity '' a another mathematical fantasy he also reject most of `` special relativity '' include the part about `` mass increase '' near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shift those quasar with red-shifts great than 1.000 really be move faster than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from u in time. in larson 's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure be the clock time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be negligible but at high speed they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be use a a fudge factor larson often use the term `` coordinate time '' when write about this in regard to `` mass increase '' it have be proven in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration force mass a f/m orthodox physicist be ignore the third factor force in larson 's theory mass stay constant and force drop toward zero force be actually a motion or combination of motion or relation between motion include inward and outward scalar motion the expansion of the universe for example be an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so-called `` big bang '' which be yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book `` the universe of motion '' by dewey b. larson 1984 north pacific publisher p.o box 13255 portland oregon 97213 456 page indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portion of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty year ago it contains final solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the formation of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true origin of the `` 3-degree '' background radiation cosmic ray and gamma- ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf explode galaxy etc.. it contains what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the follow be an example of his theory 's success in his first book in 1959 `` the structure of the physical universe '' larson predict the existence of explode galaxy several year before astronomer start find them they be a necessary consequence of larson 's comprehensive theory and when quasar be discover he have an immediate related explanation for them also gamma-ray burst astro-physicists and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious gamma-ray burst they be originally thought to originate from `` neutron star '' in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit have be detect them in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any know object except for a few case of directional coincidence gamma-ray burst be a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson accord to page 386 of his book `` the universe of motion '' publish in 1984 the gamma-ray burst be come from supernova explosion in the anti-matter half of the physical universe which larson call the `` cosmic sector '' because of the relationship between the anti-matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma-ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with know object and come from all direction uniformly i wonder how close to u in space a source location would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby gamma-ray burst larsonian binary star formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of them but binary star system be actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which be detailed in chapter 7 of his book `` the universe of motion '' and in some of his other book first of all accord to larson star do not generate energy by `` fusion '' a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the complete annihilation of heavy element heavier than iron each element have a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element be the low be this limit a star 's internal temperature increase a it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of iron there be a type i supernova explosion this be because there be so much iron present and that be related to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his book well than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star be blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which be equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long period of time both mass start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blown outward in space now start to form a red giant star the material that have be blown outward in time start to form a white dwarf star both star then start move back toward the `` main sequence '' from opposite direction on the h-r diagram the chance of the two mass fall back into the exact same location in space make a single lone star again be near zero they will instead form a binary system orbit each other accord to larson a white dwarf star have an inverse density gradient be densest at it surface because the material at it center be most widely disperse blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasy about `` degenerate matter '' `` neutron star '' `` black hole '' etc.. larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several `` mini '' white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three-dimensional time to be affected by it heat etc. these will become planet in chapter 7 of the universe of motion larson use all this information and other principle of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode 's law `` black hole '' fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w. hawk recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysis of two `` black hole '' merge together into a single `` black hole '' and conclude that the new `` black hole '' would have more mass than the sum of the two original `` black hole '' such a result should be recognize by everyone a a red flag cause widespread doubt about the whole idea of `` black hole '' etc. after reading physicist dewey b. larson 's book about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book `` the universe of motion '' it be clear to me that `` black hole '' be nothing more than mathematical fantasy the strange object at cygnus x-1 be just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the `` black hole '' that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to `` prove '' their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist stephen hawk the physicist and astronomer seem to be act a if hawk 's severe physical problem somehow make him `` wiser '' it do not i wish the same attention have be give to physicist dewey b. larson while he be still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to larson 's theory book and organization the international society of unified science electro-magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many year ago in connection with ufo 's and unorthodox inventor but i never be able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct i found a possible clue about why they might work on page 112-113 of the book `` basic property of matter '' by the late physicist dewey b. larson which describes part of larson 's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph `` a indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it be brought out in volume i larson 's book `` nothing but motion '' that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorbed by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited it follow that there be always a large excess of free electron in the material sector material half of the universe most of which be uncharged in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate be thus expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there be other process to be discuss later whereby electron be return to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such a the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level '' note that in larson 's theory uncharged electron be also massless and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency above the `` unit '' frequency spin around one axis at a particular rate below the `` unit '' rate `` unit velocity '' be the speed of light and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light accord to larson 's theory i might have the `` above '' and `` below '' label mixed up larson be say that outer space be fill with mass- less un-charged electron fly around at the speed of light if this be true then the electro-magnetic propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhaps give them a charge and mass and shoot them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson 's theory an electrical charge be a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the `` unit '' frequency superimpose on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confuse meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud suppression of larsonian physic the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson have be available for more than 30 year publish in 1959 in his first book `` the structure of the physical universe '' it be totally un-scientific for hawk wheeler sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call `` science '' or `` physic '' or `` astronomy '' etc a well a the `` scientific '' literature and the `` education '' system to totally ignore larson 's theory have they have larson 's theory have excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer such a gamma-ray burst and the nature of quasar larson 's theory deserves to be honestly and openly discuss in the physic chemistry and astronomy journal in the u.s. and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of larson 's theory should be include in all related course at uw-ec uw-madison cambridge cornell university

b"if what be be discuss could be establish or disproven by experiment and observation then i would agree with you chris the burden of proof would belong to bill but the source document for christianity the bible simply assumes god exists and make it clear to u calvinist anyway that when a person be in fellowship with god it be because god have take the initiative in reveal himself to that person so from a christian point of view the burden of proof belongs to god bill be be consistent with what the bible teach in relate his own experience with god but it would be an error on his part to assume that there be a direct causal relationship between his testimony and someone else become convince that god exists and that he need to be reconcile to god please excuse me if i miss an earlier part of this thread in which bill come across like an egotist what i saw be simply obedience to the scriptural command to `` always be ready to give a reason for the joy that be in you ''"

b'the point about it be real or not be that one do not waste time with what reality might be when one want prediction the question if the atom be there or if something else be there make measurement indicate atom be not necessary in such a system and one do not have to write a new theory of existence everytime new model be use in physic'
b'jim and andy both have it incorrect i believe the *facts* be what be there the process that exist in the present or the physical evidence of the process have occur in the past these *facts* exist with or without a theory the *theory* try and explains the *facts* and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that be both coherent and useful that it can be use to make prediction the *facts* of gravity evolution electromagnetic radiation relativity atom will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact ... or even why a theory never really becomes a fact ... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact and if we find this fact a the theory predict we say the *theory* be *supported* by the *facts* a theory be a mental construct a speculation a model if it be a good model it may be useful in science a theory be something that be support by the evidence considerable evidence sometimes *all* of the evidence a *hypothesis* be a new fledgling theory because there be not yet enough evidence to support it when a new hypothesis be propose to replace an exist theory it must explain *all* of the fact that the current theory explains and at least some of the fact that the current theory could not and/or predict new fact it be so simple ... surprised that this subject get beat to death about once a month a quick glance in a dictionary would clear up 99 of the confusion and bandwidth in this newsgroup then we could talk about really important thing like why do men have nipple -david utidjian- utidjian remarque.berkeley.edu'

b"brian ceccarelli present u with the fallacy of false dichotomy in state that we must accept every thing in the book attribute to peter or we must discount every other book of antiquity mr ceccarelli you seem to be state that we must accept accept everything write in every `` historical '' document somehow i doubt do that yourself that thus since i doubt you accept everything write in every historical document i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the word of the book attribute to peter i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity which i be sure you reject it date from the time of ramses ii this be first present here by matthew wiener these inscription be carve soon after a battle and be carve with the pharoah 's specific approval so we have true original rather than mere copy this account record the the battle of kadesh circa 1285 bc which occur on the river orontes about 100 mile south of aleppo the egyptian won this battle with the hittite and ramses have his victory inscribed all over the place a few of of these inscription have survive in near perfect form it be a record of how the pharoah pretty much single-handedly defeat the hittite after be separate from his troop note that the egyptian waver back and forth between first and third person the follow be from miriam lichtheim s _ancient egyptian literature_ volume ii my majesty cause the force of the foe from hitti to fall on their face one upon the other a crocodile fall into the water of the orontes i be after them like a griffin i attack all the country i alone for my infantry and my chariotry have desert me not one of them stood look back a i live a ra love me a my father atum favor me everything that my majesty have told i do it in truth in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry note this paragraph record not only ramses `` divine word '' but also that there be thousand of witness to the event now from the heart of battle then his majesty drove at a gallop and charge the force of the foe from hitti be alone by himself none other with him his majesty proceed to look about him and found 2500 chariot ring him on his way out ... no officer be with me no charioteer no soldier of the army no shield-bearer my infantry my chariotry yield before them not one of them stood firm to fight with them his majesty spoke `` what be this father amun be it right for a father to ignore his son be my deed a matter for you to ignore do i not walk and stand at your word i have not neglect an order you give too great be he the great lord of egypt to allow alien to step on his path what be these asiatic to you o amun the wretch ignorant of god have i not make for you many great monument ... i call to you my father amun i be among a host of stranger all country be arrayed against me i be alone there 's none with me ... the labor of many people be nothing amun be more helpful than they i come here by the command of your mouth o amun i have not transgress your command '' now though i prayed in a distant land my voice resound in southern thebe i found amun come when i call to him he give me his hand and i rejoice he call from behind a if near by '' forward i be with you i your father my hand be with you i prevail over a hundred thousand men i be lord of victory lover of valor '' i found my heart stout my breast in joy all i do succeed i be like mont ... i slaughter among them at my will not one look behind him not one turn around whoever fell down do not rise ... one call out to the other say '' no man be he who be among u it be seth great-of-strength baal in person not deed of man be these his doings they be of one who be unique who fight a hundred thousand without soldier and chariot come quick flee before him to seek life and breathe air for he who attempt to get close to him his hand all his limb grow limp one can not hold either bow or spear when one see him come race along '' my majesty hunt them like a griffin i slaughter among them unceasingly so you see brian we have a few original manuscript record the miraculous battle between the ramses and the hittite do you reject them a be *completely* true i suspect you do and if so then do you also in your own word `` question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iii nero caligula josephus cyrus the great artexerxes '' do you also thereby question all their document that s the problem with your '' all or nothing '' approach many ancient people use to mix a bit of fancy with their fact so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter and the rest of the new testament or accept no record of antiquity at all force you thereby to accept the verity of document you probably do not find completely credible a to your other argument that so many people have testify to jesus that he must be true i have three point first this be `` argumentum ad populum '' ie appeal to popular opinion you can not vote on truth for instance do the million of hindu 's past and present who testify to the reality of brahma constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma how would you answer your own question in regard to the testimony of hindu '' with a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimony be you go to say that that be all complete hooey '' if you do so `` scoff '' then how do you objectively justify your own special plead second it be not at all clear that king solomon or king david testify to jesus you can claim it to be clear but that do not make it true third it be quite arguable that abraham lincoln be not christian and that he have both a public and a private view of christianity in fact there be much discussion about it in his day yes he be publically accuse of be

b"^^ -- name other than it tell quite a lot about the man himself be you the spokesman for `` most people '' that you recognize the biblical commentary use those in the church know the language though and have no such excuse you miss the point -- which be that the prophet the psalm and revelation all together provide a very rich view of a very special event -- a wedding how be you able to make such a conclusion please note that the first part of revelation make it clear that the address be to those in the church that say it hurt to try to see what the prophecy be ahead of time -- for those outside the church so you say it should be interest to see what the investigator conclude and what the final judgment be so much for war and government eh very glad you ask since i goofed -- it should be philippian 1:14-19 here from niv because of my chain most of the brother in the lord have be encourage to speak the word of god more courageously and fearlessly it be true that some preach christ out of envy and rivalry but others out of good will the latter do so in love know that i be put here for the gospel the former preach christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely suppose that they can stir up trouble for me while i be chain but what do it matter the important thing be that in every way whether from false motif or true christ be preach and because of this i rejoice my comment stem from the realization that we who love the lord be human and imperfect whatever we `` preach '' no matter how eloquent or how corrupt -- be of little difference those who know the master's voice will recognize him -- a gem-stone amidst rock such be also the lesson of the `` stumblingblock '' for those who have an ear to hear"

b"apparently you ** read the whole thing you continue to miss the point deletion counsel that only provide alternative to abortion would be just a bias a counsel that only provide *abortion* information how about provide counsel that will give a woman help in find what *she* be comfortable with your adoption-funding idea may be a good one any idea if it be feasable make adoption easy on the birth-mother may help reduce abortion but it will *not* eliminate the need for it abortion be not do just because the mother care for the child and feel good about give it to stranger abortion be do because the mother can not afford the *pregnancy* then please justify why be `` human '' automatically make something valuable and why that include the unborn no they be not guaranteed to become productive member of society even if they do that be *many years* in the future -- until which they be a burden on someone or society there be also the matter of the mother force her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from be a productive member of society ok look like this we *are* footing the bill maybe they will take choice a. maybe they will take choice b. maybe they will take choice c. they afford any *one* of them if they take choice a have to pay them say 5 if they take choice b it would cost u 20 if they take choice c it will cost u 20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 year which one sound the most realistic for u to be willing to pay for now some people happen not to like choice a. other people happen not to like choice c pay for it that be c have be around and paid for for year even though it mean we spend a lot of money we in conscience refuse to pay for it now a have be around and be perfectly legal but it be fund in the past now a be go to be fund but some people object they like the idea of their tax money go to pay for choice a. so we could refuse to fund a at all then those woman who afford any of those choice will be force to take choice b or c which will cost *all of us* more money most of u see any reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing personal choice* from some woman the alternative be to fund a if that be what the mother chooses we will also still fund b and even c if *that* be what the mother chooses however some woman will certainly choose a and that will then save u 15 we otherwise would have have to spend your '' tax '' be not be raise to fund a choice you object they be be *lowered* because we will fund a choice that be *legal* despite your objection to it actually your tax be not really go to go down a sure you would point out but the amount that be save in that area can help out in another -- like our massive debt those other procedure you mention only cost money there be no saving in other procedure that would be require down the road without them in fact there could be additional cost down the road *because* of them this be quite different from the case of abortion this be bullshit we be *not* refuse `` to make the alternative affordable too '' if we refuse to pay for the more expensive choice of birth *then* your statement would make sense but that be not the case so it if clinton try to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery or left it out of his health-care plan i would certainly object i would also be quite surprised yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reason you think you stupid fuck *we do* want to fund *all* the choice *you* be the one who want to *not* fund all the choice your humble opinion be still wrong even with easy adoption there be still the fact that pregnancy take several month month in which a young woman could need to be get an education like finish high school enter college finish college get a job ... thing that be much harder to do if you have to `` take a break '' for a few month ... thing that have a massive impact on her future productivity you *can* have a conversation with the `` mentally incompetant '' and even though *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with `` people you just like '' it be still *possible* for others to have a conversation with them it be *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation with a fetus he be still biologically independent at least to the same extent you be now he consume nutrient and digest them in the normal manner he breathe his own air a fetus on the other hand get nutrient already digest by the mother it get it oxygen from the mother a well that be not biologically independent awareness be only *part* of what make a `` member of society '' it be the minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society i keep ask but i still see a real justification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the suffer of a sentient be i read

b"in 1993apr24.214843.10940 midway.uchicago.edu eeb1 quads.uchicago.edu i already respond to this on one dimension but afterthought cause me to make another independent reply the problem with a `` moment of silence '' be that it be not an even-handed way of `` allow '' for religion amongst student in the public school a i note before muslim need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayer they be require by muhammad to do and at least orthodox jewish prayer also have requirement that be not address by this there be in fact a highly selective bias towards christian prayer in this `` moment of silence '' shit and that be especially bizarre in that christian prayer do n't need this stuff -- a christain may pray totally incognito at any time to some extent this be true of muslim and jew a well -- what i intend in my first paragraph be that there *are* some characteristic form of prayer in *these* religion which do need special time and/or behavior which can not be undertaken without an observer be able take note of it a christian may pray at any time -- silently and without any trace of his activity be evident to others that may or may not be true of the other religious tradition amongst u certainly these tend to have some form of prayer that would evidence difference from american/protestant '' mainstream '' religion all that a `` moment of silence '' do be to allow that one tradition which need it to have a `` special '' place set aside in the public school there be nothing in christian prayer that require public form or rug or phylactery or anything else at all visible to the outside world a christian student may and probably do pray at innumerable time during the day without anyone else know it that may also be true of non- christian -- i be not claimng otherwise in the `` moment of silence '' it would still be difficult for the jew to gather and daven for the muslim to do their ablution and find qiblah to mecca and engage in the prescribed form but *of course* christian can do *their* thing -- and therefore the provision be nothing but a disguise attempt to encourage just that luckily there *is* a strong jewish presence in this country and i a a christian revere some of the jewish teacher i have in public school and a grow muslim presence a well i can only hope that the political force consequent on this will prevent the imposition of christian form on non-christians a far a i can see a a christian there be nothing in this `` moment of silence '' campaign but an attempt to use public social pressure to force child to adhere to a pattern that be bias towards christianity and a a christian i *must* protest such coercion for what worth i suspect that the coercion be not really target at the non-christians -- it be yet another case of failure amongst christian parent in `` make '' their child prayerful so that they want the public school to teach what they can not manage to teach despite have all the opportunity in the world to do so if you have taught your child to pray they do not need a moment of silence in school if you have not manage to teach them the moment will only embarrass you give it up"

b"rick i think we can safely say 1 robert be not the only person who understands the bible and 2 the leadership of the lds church historicly never have let 's consider some `` personal interpretation '' and see how much trust we should put in `` orthodox mormonism '' which could never be confuse with orthodox christianity in one of his attack on christian the mormon apostle bruce r. mcconkie say they `` thrash around in ... darkness in try to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise messiah '' he also say christian be wrong to believe `` that jehovah be the supreme deity god the father '' and that christ `` come into mortality '' a his `` only begotten '' son mcconkie then state what mormon believe today to be the truth about the matter he say that `` elohim be the father '' and `` jehovah be the son '' `` be thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have go in define their three-in-one god it come a no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in try to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise messiah some sectarian even believe that jehovah be the supreme deity whose son come into mortality a the only begotten a with their concept that god be a spirit this misinformation about the god of heaven be untrue the fact be and it too be attest by holy writ that elohim be the father and that jehovah be the son who be born into mortality a the lord jesus christ the promise messiah promise messiah p. 100 notice that mcconkie say the christian be a wrong about their `` three-in-one god '' and their belief that `` god be a spirit '' a they be in their understand of who `` elohim '' and `` jehovah '' be before examine mcconkie 's attack and it validity we shall read a few more statement by mcconkie and other mormon source concern the word '' elohim '' and `` jehovah '' mcconkie state `` ... the chief designation of christ that have be preserve for u in the old testament a that ancient work be now publish be the exalt name-title jehovah promise messiah p. 367 `` _elohim_ plural word though it be be also use a the exalt name-title of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he be god above all god mormon doctrine p. 224 agree with mcconkie on the question of who `` elohim '' and '' jehovah '' be the apostle james e. talmage state `` _elohim_ a understood and use in the restore church of jesus christ be the name-title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit be _jehovah_ -- the only begotten in the flesh jesus christ jesus the christ p. 38 `` a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve '' apostle of the mormon church state that `` god the eternal father ... be designate d by the exalt name-title 'elohim ... '' article of faith p. 466 `` ... christ in his preexistent antemortal or unembodied state ... be know a jehovah ... '' article of faith p. 471 today mormon leader teach that `` elohim '' in the ot refers to god the father and `` jehovah '' refers to christ mcconkie attack christian for say `` jehovah '' can refer to the father he stress that these two '' name-titles '' should not be change around so that christ be call '' elohim '' and the father be call `` jehovah '' `` ... the father ... be elohim not jehovah ... jehovah be christ and christ be jehovah they be one and the same person '' promise messiah p. 111 in the ot of the kjv of the bible the hebrew word `` elohim '' be use to refer to the true god false god and goddess and the judge of israel when refer to the true god `` elohim '' be translate with a capital `` g. '' when refer to false god and goddess and the judge of israel it be translate with a small `` g. '' it be translate four time a `` judge '' exod 21:6 22:8-9 once a `` judge '' 1 sam 2:25 twice a `` mighty '' gen. 23:6 exod 9:28 once a `` angel '' p 8:5 once a `` godly '' mal 2:15 once a `` great '' gen. 30:8 and once a '' very great '' 1 sam 14:15 the word `` jehovah '' be the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel point take from the word '' adonai '' many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation be yahweh or yahveh however since `` jehovah '' rather than yahweh be the word use by mormonism this section will also use '' jehovah '' instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claim of mormon leader regard that name `` jehovah '' unlike `` elohim '' be never use of false god it be the personal name of the triune god of the bible in the kjv `` jehovah '' be render primarily `` lord '' sometimes '' god '' and rarely `` lord '' now that we understand something about the word `` elohim '' and '' jehovah '' and their use by mormon leader we shall consider the apostle mcconkie 's attack on christian for believe the father be `` jehovah '' in try to prove that `` jehovah '' refers exclusively to christ mcconkie cite several verse from the bible some of these verse and mcconkie's interpretation of them will be examine to see whether he be right remember mcconkie say the father be not `` jehovah '' he be only '' elohim '' the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie's interpretation of p 110:1. of this verse he state `` of whom spake david when his tongue be touch by the holy spirit and he testify `` the lord say unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemy thy footstool '' p 110:1 two lord be here involve one be speak to the other one be great than the other one be make provision for the triumph and glory of the other who be they and what message be contain in this messianic prophecy `` what think ye of christ '' our lord ask certain of his detractor toward the end of his mortal ministry `` whose son be he '' be christ the son of god or of someone else be he to be born of a divine parent or will he be a other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father that he be to be a descendant of david be a matter of great pride to all the jew and so they answer `` the son of david '' david 's son truly he be but he be more much more and so our lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture ask `` how then doth david in spirit call him lord say the lord say unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemy thy footstool if david then call him lord how be he his son '' that be if he be only the son of david how be it that the great king act under inspiration call him lord and worship him a such and we might add _who be the other lord the one who spake unto david 's lord can there be any question a to how jesus be interpret the word of the psalm he be say that it mean '_the father say unto the son elohim say unto jehovah_ sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry then i will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever promise messiah pp 101-102 emphasis add agree with the above statement by mcconkie the follow remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormon think of christ p. 6 read `` the lord elohim the father say unto my lord jehovah the son ... '' bracket in original mcconkie clearly state that it be `` elohim '' the father who be speak to `` jehovah '' the son in this psalm however when one look at the hebrew word translate `` lord '' it becomes apparent that either the first `` lord '' be not the father or else the father be `` jehovah '' either way mcconkie be wrong the psalm read `` the lord jehovah say unto my lord adon sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemy thy footstool p 110:1 the first `` lord '' in this verse be `` jehovah '' who mormonism say be christ not the father the second `` lord '' be the hebrew word `` adon '' singular for `` adonai '' meaning master or lord if the first `` lord '' be the father and the second `` lord '' be the son then the father be '' jehovah '' and the son be `` adon '' however if the father be not `` jehovah '' a mcconkie claimed then the first `` lord '' be `` jehovah '' the son but who then be `` adon '' obviously the father be `` jehovah '' in this psalm and his son be `` adon '' another example involves isa 42:6 about which mcconkie state the follow `` i the lord have call thee in righteousness '' _isaiah quote the father a say of christ_ `` and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentile '' isa 42:6 promise messiah p. 81 emphasis add mcconkie say the father be speak of christ in this passage which read `` i the lord jehovah have call thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentile isa 42:6 accord to mcconkie `` i the lord '' refers to the father and '' thine '' and `` thee '' refer to christ however the `` lord '' who be speak be `` jehovah '' which mean either mcconkie be wrong about who be speak or else the father be `` jehovah '' another example involves p 22:7-8. of these verse mcconkie state shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him see he delighted in him '' p 22:7-8 _the fulfillment a jesus hung on the cross_ be found in these word `` the chief priest mock him with the scribe and elder say he save others himself he can not save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trust in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he say i be the son of god the thief also which be crucify with him cast the same in his teeth '' matt 27:41-44 promise messiah pp 530-531 emphasis add p 22:7-8 read a follow `` all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the lord jehovah that he would deliver him let him deliver him see he delighted in him mcconkie say these verse have their fulfillment `` a jesus hung on the cross '' that mean the person who be scorn in these verse be christ who then be the `` lord '' in whom he trust it be `` jehovah '' the father another example involves p 31:13 and p 41:9. regard them mcconkie state the follow `` with reference to the connive and conspire plot incident to our lord 's arrest and judicial trial the prophecy be `` they take counsel together against me they devise to take away my life '' p 31:13 `` mine own familiar friend in whom i trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up his heel against me '' p 41:9 promise messiah p. 532 apostle mcconkie say these psalm refer to christ 's `` arrest and judicial trial '' we shall first consider p 31 and then p 41. while mcconkie only quote verse 13 of p 31 verse 14 will also be include to give a complete understand of the matter `` for i have heard the slander of many fear be on every side while they take counsel together against me they devise to take away my life but i trust in thee o lord jehovah i say thou art my god elohim p 31:13-14 mcconkie say verse 13 refer to jesus christ verse 14 go on to tell that he christ trust in the `` lord '' who be call his '' god '' or `` elohim '' mormonism teach that the god above jesus be '' elohim '' the father verse 14 however reveals that the `` elohim '' of the man jesus be `` jehovah '' the father in p 41 mcconkie only quote one verse however two verse will be consider in this examination `` yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up his heel against me but thou o lord jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them p 41:9-10 mcconkie state above that verse 9 refer to juda role in christ 's death since it be juda who be the `` familiar friend '' who '' lift up his heel '' the pronoun `` mine '' `` i '' `` my '' and `` me '' in verse 9 must refer to christ notice that at the begin of verse 10 there be a change of pronoun to `` thou '' which refers to the `` lord '' jehovah then the pronoun `` me '' and `` i '' which refer to christ be use again that mean christ be speak to `` jehovah '' the father in these verse another example involves mcconkie 's follow remark about p 110:4 `` one of the great messianic prophecy spoken by the mouth of david ever after the order of melchizedek '' p 110:4 promise messiah p. 450 mcconkie admit this be a messianic prophecy involve christ the question be what in this verse refers to christ `` the lord jehovah hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek p 110:4 do the `` lord '' which be `` jehovah '' refer to christ if mcconkie be right and jesus be `` jehovah '' but the father be not then the `` lord '' would have to refer to christ but who then be the one address a the `` priest forever after the order of melchizedek '' the bible reveals that the one refer to be jesus christ heb 5:8-10 6:20 7 therefore the `` lord '' jehovah in p 110:4 be the father another example involves isa 53:4-12. of these verse mcconkie state `` of the atone sacrifice of the future messiah isaiah say ... the _lord_ have laid on him the iniquity of u all ... it pleased the _lord_ to bruise him ... promise messiah p. 234 emphasis add mcconkie rightly say these verse refer to `` the atone sacrifice of the future messiah '' however what he fail to mention be that they also prove that the father be `` jehovah '' verse 6 read `` all we like sheep have go astray we have turn every one to his own way and the lord jehovah hath laid on him christ the iniquity of u all '' and verse 10 read `` yet it pleased the lord jehovah to bruise him christ ... '' obviously the `` lord '' who laid on christ `` the iniquity of u all '' and who bruise him be god the father who be call `` jehovah '' in these verse remember mcconkie state that `` some sectarian even believe that jehovah be the supreme deity '' and that christ `` come into mortality '' a his `` only begotten '' son he call this concept '' misinformation '' that be `` untrue '' to prove that it be mcconkie who be misinform and believe untruth two scriptural reference 2 sam 7:14 p 2:7 will be examine mcconkie state the follow regard these scripture `` in the midst of a passage that be clearly messianic the lord say of the seed of david `` i will be his father and he shall be my son '' 2 sam 7:14 in the second psalm the whole of which be also clearly messianic occurs this statement `` thou art my son this day have i begotten thee '' p 2:7 paul quote both of these statement in hebrew 1:5 and say they be prophecy that christ would come a the son of god promise messiah p. 143 mcconkie cite heb 1:5 to show that 2 sam 7:14 and p 2:7 refer to christ who `` would come a the son of god '' since mcconkie first reference 2 sam 7:14 this examination will too however along with verse 14 verse 11-13 will also be include `` and a since the time that i command judge to be over my people israel and have cause thee to rest from all thine enemy also the lord jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy day be fulfil and thou shalt sleep with thy father i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowel and i will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son 2 sam 7:11-14 these verse teach that the `` lord '' jehovah would have a son the messiah in the second example mcconkie cite p 2:7. this examination will include verse 8. notice that it be the `` lord '' jehovah who say '' thou art my son this day have i begotten thee '' `` i will declare the decree the lord jehovah hath say unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost part of the earth for thy possession mcconkie say these verse of scripture be `` clearly messianic '' and he acknowledge they teach that `` christ would come a the son of god '' what he be not willing to acknowledge however be that these scripture also teach that the father be `` jehovah '' and that the '' sectarian '' who believe `` jehovah be the supreme deity whose son '' be jesus christ `` the only begotten '' be right in their belief another example involves mic 5:4. of this verse mcconkie state the follow `` and so truly do our lord act _during his mortal ministry truly this be he of whom it be written_ `` he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god ... for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth '' mic 5:4 promise messiah p. 182 emphasis add accord to mcconkie the pronoun `` he '' at the begin of mic 5:4 refers to christ `` during his mortal ministry '' who then be the '' lord his god '' mic 5:4 read `` and he christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord jehovah in the majesty of the name of the lord jehovah his god elohim ... for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth obviously the `` lord '' of jesus christ be `` jehovah '' the father who be refer to a `` jehovah his elohim '' another example involves p 2:2 and isa 61:1. of these verse mcconkie state the follow `` a number of messianic passage speak of `` the lord and ... his anoint '' p 2:2 signify that the chosen one be consecrate and set apart for the ministry and mission that be his _jesus apply these passage to himself_ by quote isaiah 's prophecy `` the lord hath anoint me to preach good tidings unto the meek '' isa 61:1 and then say `` this day be this scripture fulfil in your ear '' luke 4:21 promise messiah pp 182-183 emphasis add the first source mcconkie quote -- p 2:2 -- read a follow `` the king of the earth set themselves and the ruler take counsel together against the lord jehovah and against his anoint mcconkie say the `` anoint '' one be christ if that be true who be `` jehovah '' if `` jehovah '' be always christ who be the `` anoint '' one obviously `` jehovah '' be refer to god the father and the '' anoint '' be indeed refer to christ the second source mcconkie cite be isa 61:1 which state `` the spirit of the lord adonai god jehovah be upon me because the lord jehovah hath anoint me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to them that be bound the one who be anoint to preach bind up proclaim and open be jesus christ who then be the one who anoint him this verse say the `` lord '' jehovah do the anoint again we face the same problem if `` jehovah '' do not refer to the father but only to christ then jesus anoint someone but who a mcconkie point out `` jesus apply these passage to himself '' therefore the `` jehovah '' who anoint christ be god the father other example could be cite to show that mcconkie and other mormon leader be wrong when they say god the father be not `` jehovah '' however these should be enough to expose their error now what about mormonism 's claim that jesus be `` jehovah '' but he be not `` elohim '' it be true that jesus be `` jehovah '' the follow scripture prove this fact `` thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord jehovah of host i be the first and i be the last and beside me there be no god isa 44:6 jesus say ... i be the first and the last i be he that liveth and be dead ... rev 1:17-18 `` ... saith the lord jehovah ... they shall look upon me whom they have pierce and they shall mourn for him a one mourneth for his only son ... zech 12:1,10 behold he christ cometh with cloud

saviour jesus christ tit 2:13. see also jer 42:5 and rev 1:5 mal 3:6 and heb 13:8 1 kin 8:28,39 and john 2:24-25 isa 25:8 and 2 tim 1:10 p 107:24,29 and matt 8:26 prov.3:12 and rev 3:19 while mormon be right when they say jesus be `` jehovah '' they be wrong when they say he be not `` elohim '' the bible reveals that '' jehovah '' be the only true `` elohim '' there be all others be false remember `` jehovah '' be the personal name of the triune god who have reveal himself in the bible before we consider biblical quote which show that `` jehovah '' and '' elohim '' be not two separate god a mormon claim let u first note that not only be both god the father and christ address a `` jehovah '' and `` elohim '' but so be the holy spirit `` whereof the _holy ghost_ ... _said_ ... this _is_ the covenant that i will make with them after those day saith the lord i will put my law into their heart and in their mind will i write them and their sin and iniquity will i remember no more heb 10:15-17 emphasis on `` holy ghost '' and `` say '' add behold the day come _saith the lord_ jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah ... i will put my law in their inward part and write it in their heart and will be their god elohim and they shall be my people ... i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more jer

spirit of the lord jehovah spake by me and his word be in my tongue 2 sam 23:2. see also heb 3:7-11 with p 95:6-11 let u now continue with the biblical quote which show that '' jehovah '' and `` elohim '' be not two separate god a mormon claim `` and when the lord jehovah saw that he moses turn aside to see god elohim call unto him out of the midst of the bush and say moses moses and he say here be i ... bruce r. mcconkie acknowledge that `` it be '' christ 's `` voice that spoke to moses in the burning bush ...

mormon leader be right when they say `` jehovah '' be god the son and `` elohim '' be god the father these verse from the bible would be teach that the mormon son be above his father however a mcconkie clearly state mormon believe `` elohim '' the father not `` jehovah '' the son be the `` god above all god '' -- that jesus be above all except the father yet the bible teach that `` jehovah '' be above all `` elohim '' at a byu dev on march 2 1982 bruce r. mcconkie make the follow remark about pray to jesus `` another peril be that those so involve often begin to pray directly to christ because of some special friendship they feel have be developed ... this be plain sectarian nonsense our prayer be address to the father and to him only ... ... perfect prayer be address to the father in the name of the son it be uttered by the power of the holy ghost ... our relationship with the lord pp 19-20 mcconkie state on p. 335 of his book promise messiah that the mormon `` pray to the father not the son ... '' on p. 306 of the same book mcconkie state that `` christ the son be jehovah '' this be important to remember because although mcconkie say prayer be not to be offer to the mormon christ who be `` jehovah '' the bible state repeatedly in the ot that people prayed to `` jehovah '' and he not only heard those prayer but he accepted them a valid request the follow be but a small sample of the vast number of time people prayed to `` jehovah '' `` in my distress i call upon the lord jehovah and cry unto my god elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry come before him even into his ear p 18:6 `` and the lord jehovah say unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast make before me i have hallow this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and

not hid i say i will confess my transgression unto the lord jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin for this shall every one that be godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found ... p 32:5-6 notice above in p 32:6 that the `` godly '' pray to `` jehovah '' accord to mcconkie and other mormon leader that be christ the very one to whom mcconkie say people should not pray the bible reveals there be only one true `` elohim '' and his name be `` jehovah '' all other `` elohim '' be false they be idol that cause their follower to commit adultery against the true `` elohim '' and idolatry `` for the lord jehovah be great and greatly to be praise he be to be fear above all god elohim for all the god elohim of the nation be idol but the lord jehovah make the heaven p 96:4-5 `` thou shalt have no other god elohim before me exod 20:3 `` now i know that the lord jehovah be great than all god elohim ... exod 18:11 `` and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah

therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name be the lord jehovah jer 16:20-21 `` and if it seem evil unto you

ye dwell but a for me and my house we will serve the lord jehovah and the people answer and say god elohim forbid that we should forsake the lord jehovah to serve other god elohim josh 24:15-16 these verse teach that the only true living `` elohim '' in heaven and on earth be `` jehovah '' -- the triune god who make heaven and earth and all therein `` jehovah '' be great than any `` elohim '' because all other '' elohim '' be idol the reality behind them be demonic deut 32:17 '' jehovah elohim '' have give explicit warning and guideline regard these false `` elohim '' he told his people not to have any `` elohim '' but him he told the people that if they left him for the false `` elohim '' those `` elohim '' would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and would perish he warn the people to `` take heed '' that their `` heart be not deceive '' into worship serve swear by and make covenant with false `` elohim '' `` jehovah elohim '' told his people he would eventually judge all false `` elohim '' and their follower despite these warning and guideline `` elohim 's '' covenant people forsook him and believe in and worship the false `` elohim 's '' of the people they come in contact with ju 10:6 state that `` the child of israel do evil again in the sight of the lord jehovah and serve baalim and ashtaroth and the god elohim of syria and the god elohim of zidon and the god elohim of moab and the god elohim of the child of ammon and the god elohim of the philistine and forsook the lord jehovah and serve not him '' this examination have show that the `` elohim '' of mormonism like the `` elohim '' in ju 10:6 be not the true `` jehovah elohim '' therefore the people who leave the true `` elohim '' for the mormon `` elohim '' will do '' evil ... in the sight of the lord jehovah '' although mcconkie attack christian for their belief in a triune god who be spirit and for their belief that god the father jehovah sent his son into the world these belief be true god be triune he be spirit he be `` jehovah '' and he do send his son into the world to redeem mankind it be obvious from this examination that it be not the christian who `` thrash around in ... darkness '' about who `` elohim '' and '' jehovah '' be one wonder what `` holy writ '' mcconkie have in mind when he state that it attests to the fact that `` elohim be the father and that jehovah be the son '' he certainly do not mean the bible which teach that the father son and holy spirit be all the one `` jehovah elohim '' he apparently do not mean the d c either because chapter 109 verse 1,4,9-10 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the father a '' jehovah '' summary obviously joseph fielding smith 's statement that the mormon '' have a clear and perfect understand of the nature of god '' doctrine of salvation 1:279 be not accurate the mormon god be not the true god a mormonism claim but be idol which cause their follower to commit adultery against god and idolatry in answer to jesus question `` but whom say ye that i be '' mormon say jesus be someone different from the jesus who be reveal in the bible and whom the apostle preach therefore anyone trust in the mormon jesus be believe in `` another jesus '' whom paul warn about bernard p. brockbank of the first quorum of the seventy admit in the may 1977 issue of the ensign a mormon publication that the mormon jesus be different from the christian jesus he state that '' it be true that many of the christian church worship a different jesus christ than be worship by the mormon or the church of jesus christ of latter-day saint '' p. 26 the people who believe in the mormon jesus be commit adultery against god and idolatry they do not have the son therefore they do not have the father and they do not have eternal life a the apostle bruce r. mcconkie rightly state `` salvation come only by worship the true god '' promise messiah p. 163 mcconkie also rightly state that `` the mere worship of a god who have the proper scriptural name do not assure one that he be worship the true and living god '' because the `` true name of deity '' can be apply to `` false concept of god '' mormon doctrine p. 270 remember that the apostle stephen l. richards admit that joseph smith jr. give `` a new conception of god and the godhead '' contribution of joseph smith p. 1 it be important for the people who have left the true triune god reveal in the bible to repent and return to him they must forsake the sin of idolatry and adultery which they be commit in mormonism `` ... all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be write in the earth because they have forsaken the lord jehovah the fountain of living water jer 17:13 `` and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other god elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish deut 8:19 `` thou shalt make no covenant with ... their god elohim exod 23:32 `` ... put away the strange god elohim that be among you and be clean and change your garment gen. 35:2 `` ... flee from idolatry 1 cor 10:14 it be necessary that christian heed the warning of the bible if they do they will not fall into the sin of adultery against god and idolatry remember to know the `` only true god '' be eternal life john 17:3"
b"well the best thing to do be to read the book `` parallel universe '' by dr. fred wolf in essence dr. wolf say that one interpretation of the sub-atomic particle/wave duality be that what we perceive a a wave be actually an infinate number of parallel universe overlaid and in each of these universe there be a particle in a different location when we do something to make a particle `` appear '' we be actually cause all the parallel universe to collapse into one apparently this be one line of thought on the nature of qm that be go through some of the scientific community dr. wolf and many others claim that somehow the collapse be cause by the mental effort of observe the particle this implys that mind be more than merely a biological phenomenon he then extrapolates that if mind be an integral part of the universe then perhaps consciousness be the element that give order and form to the universe s it/themself s it all get rather interest but what i find facinating be that this would explain the phenomenon of `` magick '' a practice in my religion dr. wolf speculates that the order functionality of mind could be cause by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible future he say that this might be do by some sort of communication between one current and possible future self i have long speculate that if magick be not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be cause by some sort of a selection of one of many possible future i realize that this get pretty bizarre but it never hurt to keep an open mind and at least file it all away a another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourselves after all the more we learn about the universe in which we live the more we learn that it be truly a very strange place"
b"no this be far from clear we only have the word of the fbi spokepeople that a survivor make this claim we have the contradictory word of the lawyer who spoke with the survivor individually that all of them agree that they do not have a suicide pact and do not intentionally start the fire in the absense of any more evidence i see how we can decide who to believe furthermore it quite possible that there be no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle take it upon themselves to kill everyone else with the state of the area now we may never know what happen again we have only the word of the fbi on this claim the lawyer who have also talk to the survors deny that any of them be make that claim i will agree on your assessment a to the relative probability it more likely that the bd 's start the fire than do the fbi but there be currently no way to decide what actually happen base on the publically available evidence which be nearly none d. the fire be an start accidentally by the bd i be truely amaze that i have heard or read of no one suggest this possibility with all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adult wear gas mask it have to have be chaotic inside i can easily image someone leave a lamp too close to something or accidentally drop a lamp or knock one over with the wind it would have quickly gotten out of control no i think that d be also quite reasonable i personally really ass any relative probablities to either of these 3 probability although if force to bet on the issue i would probably take an accident either fbi or bd over intential set of the fire i would also like to add a comment related to the report that body recover have gunshot wound the coroner be on the today show this morning and categorically deny that they 've reach any such conclusion he point out that under intense heat sufficient pressure build up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which be quite consist with te report read and heard in short there 's be almost no evidence corroborate any of the many scenario a to what happen on monday we should remain skeptical until more information be available --"

b"when robert refers to the `` orthodox '' he be talk about the historical position of the christian faith such thing be derive from biblcal text through the century by the apocolic father of the faith you be right that people read thing differently in the bible and this be alright in part like parable and such forth however when it come to the essential doctrine of the historical orthodox christan belief there be only one correct way to read it for example either the doctrine of the trinity be true or it be false yes people read the text differently but only one position be true they both can not be accord to the text the doctrine be true and have always exist"

b"yes exactly what i felt my heart just felt that what i be be taught be *wrong* -- a basically good message but frame in error i could not with a clear conscience accept that woman be somehow not equal to men that homosexual be `` guilty '' of their lifestyle that pride in one 's work be a bad thing that jesus die for me -- i want anybody to die for me especially a an impersonal act where the person possibly even *know* me well enough to really know if worth die for or not i be never able to accept the bit about jesus 's death be a good thing if that mean that just not comprehend a basic message of christianity then so be it maybe just not compatible with christianity i just refuse to follow rule blindly and since i even convince myself that your god even exists in the way you describe it get to just follow my own conscience in these matter think that my moral be shoddy or nonexistent just because i believe in your god i will not steal and i will not murder -- not because i fear divine repudiation but because these just ** in my character you may think there 's nothing keep me from just run around on a murder spree steal thing when able insult people for the heck of it because not answerable to anyone but be wrong answerable to myself a life like that would be a cheap life i happen to want to earn respect in myself my initial break with christianity come after a lot of soul-searching and a lot of wonder why i could no longer feel the 'presence of god with me i finally decide that i have once `` felt '' this presence just a i have `` felt '' my mighty teddy bear beside me when i be a little tyke protect me from the monster under the bed -- that i have believe in god just a i have believe in the teddy bear a something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceive danger since then never abandon the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity do exist but there be a few time when in my darken room by my bed i have set aside everything i believe for a moment and call out to whatever 's out there because i want to know the truth even if it mean abandon everything i know and i have not yet receive an answer nope it may well be unknowable scientist have suggest that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the three-dimensional universe may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional sphere see _sphereland_ the sequel to _flatland_ for more thought on this our entire universe might just be an electron in a four- dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variable become too much for u to even speculate on that be there 's no possible way for u to know exactly how we come to be so there 's no reason at all to believe that your god exists nor have anything to do with it christian have provide me with nothing except quote from your holy book and all sort of tactic to try to get me to believe guilt trip insinuation that without moral argument from disbelief `` how can you possibly believe that god ** exist `` and so forth all ask be for you to convince me i want to be convince but not go to be easy have have year upon year of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside i view it a harmful in many way it prey on people who want to find meaning in their life and once get these people it teach them to have pity and sometimes starkly intolerant of others who do not share these view maybe say that your religion teach that -- but get to judge christianity from the christian i know i feel that it be entirely possible and good to have faith in one's self and to be a positive influence on society for no well reason than that so i hope that my word in this newsgroup will at least make some people think i want christian to realize that there be perfectly valid lifestyle and opinion that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever and i want people who be consider christianity to realize that christianity do not hold the sole key to a happy fulfil life i have know some very nice christian who have do some very nice thing i think what set these people apart from the general mass be that they recognize that their religious belief may be wrong and they know the weakness of their religion yet they still decide to believe but they keep their belief to themselves and do not think any less of people who agree with them precisely my point still not give me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem ... ... just a the moslem religious and the buddhist religious who *is* religious then"

b"this be quite different from say `` employ force on other people be immoral period unfortunately from time to time we be oblige to do this immoral thing for reason of self-preservation and so we have to bear the moral consequence of that since both statement to all intent and purpose say effectively the same thing be you serious two statement one of which say that use of force in the give situation be moral and the other of which say it be not moral `` say effectively the same thing '' yes when you tag on the `` unfortunately ...

b"brian kendig first state i ask brian kendig state make up your mind and we do not end perfect either we be never perfect can you name one person young or old past or present that you deem perfect good luck then you lie to yourself you do not know your shortcoming i have clearly show one of your shortcoming if not two that be ignorance of the bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even know it content because you have be too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself and to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion i bet you do not even know what the word `` christ '' mean or which prophet use `` christ '' to describe the `` son of man '' yes i agree with that so we must learn first read the bible come up with our own interpretation evaluate what be be say and by whom check the history book a well compare someone else's interpretation with your own then make a judgment but i tell you the truth 99 of what be be say in the bible need interpretation a much a a coffee cup need interpretation and remember the bible a guru 's esoteric guide to metaphysics it take a theologian to understand what be be say the bible be a bunch of testimony from people like you and i address to people like you and i. these guy write down what they saw and heard be it their open diary -- and they want to tell you something and because they want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to know they encouch their idea in esoteric rhetoric but in simple straight-forward language you have chosen the road that avoids the bible you have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living god because that road look appeal to you you rather build your own road one that go far away from that confrontation but be assure of this you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly i see what you mean i hear what your say i be not degrade your life but i have heard the same irrational excuse for year there be nothing new in what you be say and by your own word you be `` spout off '' contradiction if contradiction give you meaning then your life must be sad bingo for god so love the world he give his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever last life i look what god *did* he have give his son even to his death so that i can have hope in his resurrection and know that life for nothing but have glorious purpose because you turn your eye away from testimony and history you choose to lie to yourself that he exist for you ignore what have be say for thousand of year you sound exactly almost verbatim like the lazarus of jesus 's story start in luke 16:19. and the conclusion of that story be a bleak one lazarus wound up in hell the story end like this `` for if lazarus even listen to moses and the prophet he even believe if a man rise from the dead '' arrogance at it best the fact be you be not rational several specific case have already be cite and again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regard to heaven jesus do tell you something of what to expect in heaven jesus expect you to use your brain to believe in him jesus do not expect you to placate either jesus want you to willingly come to him but not a his grovel slave but rather a his brother who will share in his glorious rich why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself you maintain you have an open mind see whether you be lie to yourself for yourself i do understand what you say but be not what i feel go amiss here you miss the point living a `` good life '' have no eternal consequence once they close the amusement park of life to you that be the end to you it be over to you therefore your time spent in the amusement park be meaningless it have no eternal consequence to you nor to anyone left on earth but then you contradict yourself from a previous post you say do evil thing be bad to you it matter if you do evil thing or good thing it be all meaningless in the end anyway so go rob a bank go tell someone you dislike that he be a dirty rotten slime bag what 's restrain you life after all have no eternal consequence and accountability be irrelevant at which time you be truly not the master of yourself so you and your holy book say by the same token therefore santa claus delivers toy every xmas you see i have no reason to believe that what you say be true please give me some reason that i similarly apply to santa claus you have every reason to believe that what jesus say and the witness of jesus say be true but you choose to be unreasonable and `` ignore '' the reason by definition `` ignorance '' santa claus be say to live at the north pole and have a squad of elf and fly reindeer ever see a fly reindeer have anyone in human history see a fly reindeer have anyone see a reindeer whose nose blink red on the other hand be people born in bethlehem be nebuchandezzar really a king be daniel really one of his court official be david and solomon really king of israel and judah be their really a king call jehoachin do sennecherib really attack jerusalem 600 year before christ do sennacherib really lose his battle -- and badly be there really a caiaphas who interrogate jesus yes yes yes history verifies it it be nonfiction do you have a problem discern truth from fiction perhaps you evaluate the context of grimm 's fairy tale apart from that of the scientific american i suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity be this what you be tell me or be it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out that not a fairy tale get real have you ever be to zaire do you have to go there to be assure that there really be such a place give your irrationality i take it you have never use a map in your life"
