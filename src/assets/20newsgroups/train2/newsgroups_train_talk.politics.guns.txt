 ever since the siege at waco start the fbi spokesman have be stress how unstable and paranoid david koresh be he stress how likely it be the the branch davidians would commit mass suicide he be concerned with the safety of the child what do the fbi do to defuse the situation do they try to reassure koresh do the fbi offer medical assistance to the bd do the fbi offer them a supply of water when the bd pump stop work do the permit koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound what the fbi do be harass the branch davidians a much a possible they kept powerful light shin on the compound shut off their electrical power put their pump out of action assault their ear with loud noise cut off their communication with the outside and kept limit their permitter the state goal be to put pressure on david koresh be the fbi attempt to get koresh to surrender or be they hop to get koresh so mad that he and some of his follower would attack the the tank it appear that the tactic employ by the fbi do drive koresh over the edge the blame for the death should be share by both the federal expert whose tactic drove koresh over the edge and the fool at the atf who plan the raid stupidity and incompetence of the batf and the fbi leadership have result in the needle death of 90 innocent people if every thing have go a plan 90 people would be alive today instead the atf screw up and cause the death of 90  incompetent law enforcement can kill you

 here be a press release from the white house president clinton  s remark on waco with q a to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary 202 456 2100 washington april 20    follow be remark by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press 1 36 p m  edt the president on february the 28th four federal agent be kill in the line of duty try to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which have illegally stockpile weaponry and ammunition and place innocent child at risk because the batf operation have fail to meet it objective a 51 day standoff ensue the federal bureau of investigation then make every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and far loss of life the bureau  s effort be ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they be deal david koresh be dangerous irrational and probably insane he engage in numerous activity which violate both federal law and common standard of decency he be moreover responsible for the death and injury which occur during the action against the compound in february give his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostage no provocative action be take for more than seven week by federal agent against the compound this weekend i be briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi design to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan include a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it be hop force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i be inform of the plan to end the siege i discuss it with attorney general reno i ask the question i thought it be appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought be right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday  s action end in a horrible human tragedy mr  koresh  s response to the demand for his surrender by federal agent be to destroy himself and murder the child who be his captive a well a all the other people who be there who do not survive he kill those he control and he bear ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensue now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have direct the united state department of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happen and why and whether anything could have be dne differently i have told the department to involve independent professional law enforcement official in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answer in whatever time be require to complete the review finally i have direct the department to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiry so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agent on the front line who do the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstance again i want to say a i do yesterday i be very sorry for the loss of life which occur at the begin and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempt to join cult and to become involve with people like david koresh will be deter by the horrible scene they have see over the last seven week and i hope very much that the difficult situation which federal agent confront there and which they will be doubtless require to confront in other context in the future will be somewhat well handle and well understood because of what have be learn now q mr  president can you first of all tell u why after 51 day you decide    q mr  president can you describe for u what it be that janet reno outline to you in your 15 minute phone conversation with    the president i hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno    q mr  president    the president i  ll answer both your question but i do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i be told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time have come to take another step in try to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be    that they want to go in and use tear gas which have be test not to cause permanent damage to adult or to child but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it be hop that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i be far told that under no circumstance would our people fire any shot at them even if fire upon they be go to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicle which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact a you know an awful lot of shot be fire by the cult member at the federal official there be no shot come back from the government side i ask a number of question the first question i ask be why now we have wait seven week why now the reason i be give be the follow number one that there be a limit to how long the federal authority could maintain with their limited resource the quality and intensity of coverage by expert there they might be need in other part of the country number two that the people who have review this have never see a case quite like this one before and they be convince that no progress have be make recently and no progress be go to be make through the normal mean of get koresh and the other cult member to come out number three that the danger of their do something to themselves or to others be likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they have reason to believe that the child who be still inside the compound be be abuse significantly a well a be force to live in unsanitary and unsafe condition so for those reason they want to move at that time the second question i ask the attorney general be whether they have give consideration to all of the thing that could go wrong and evaluate them against what might happen that be good she say that the fbi personnel on the scene and those work with them be convince that the chance of bad thing happen would only increase with the passage of time the third question i ask be have the military be consult a soon a the initial tragedy come to light in waco the first thing i ask to be do because it be obvious that this be not a typical law enforcement situation military people be then brought in help to analyze the situation and some of the problem that be present by it and so i ask if the military have be consult the attorney general say that they have and that they be in basic agreement that there be only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military    something that both side thought be not of overwhelm significance have ask those question and gotten those answer i say that if she thought it be the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr  president    the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception    report widely television radio and newspaper    that you be try somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no bewilder by it the only reason i make no public statement yesterday    let me say    the only reason i make no public statement yesterday be that i have nothing to add to what be be say and i literally do not know until rather late in the day whether anybody be still alive other than those who have be actually see and take to the hospital or take into custody it be purely and simply a question of wait for event to unfold there be    i have    i account for why people speculate one way or the other but i talk to the attorney general on the day before the action take place i talk to her yesterday i call her again late last night after she appear on the larry king show and i talk to her again this morning a president    it be not possible for a president to distance himself from thing that happen when the federal government be in control i will say this however i be frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatic murder themselves applause i regret what happen but it be not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people kill four federal official in the line of duty they be heavily arm they fire on federal official yesterday repeatedly and they be never fire back on we do everything we could to avoid the loss of life they make the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the child but in the end the last comment i have from janet reno be when    and i talk to her on sunday    i say now i want you to tell me once more why you believe    not why they believe    why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she say because of the child they have evidence that those child be still be abuse and that in increasingly unsafe condition and that they think it will get any easy with time    with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that be where i think thing stand q can we assume then that you think this be mishandle in view of the outcome that you run out of patience and if you have it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no    well i think what you can assume be just exactly what i announce today this be a    the fbi have do a lot of thing right for this country over a long period of time this be the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the step along the way be there something else we should have know be there some other question they should have ask be there some other question i should have ask can i say for sure that no one    that we could have do nothing else to make the outcome come different i know that why i want the inquiry and why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside expert who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there be unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there be anything we can do particularly when there be child involve but i do think it be important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case be the people who kill others and then kill themselves q mr  president be there any other option present to you for resolve this situation at any point from february 28th until yesterday the president well yes i get regular report all along the way there be lot of other option pursue if you go back    you all cover it very well the fbi    you do a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authority there pursue any number of other option all along the way and a lot of them early on seem to be work some of the child get out some of the other people left there be a    at one point there seem to be some line of communication opening up between koresh and the authority and then he would say thing and not do them and thing just begin to spin downward whether there be other    in term of what happen yesterday the conversation i have with the attorney general do not involve other option except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we be pursue    because they say they want to do this because they thought this be the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves what they thought q do the government know that the child do not have gas mask q congressional hearing once the situation    be you in agreement with that the president up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think very important that the treasury and justice department launch this investigation and bring in some outside expert and a i say in my statement if any congressional committee want to look into it we will fully cooperate there be nothing to hide here this be probably the most well covered operation of it kind in the history of the country

 in some south american country after political undesirable disappear the family would get a notice of death and a bill for the disposal of the body you apparently think that would be a good idea the federal government initiate this action against koresh and his follower surround them for 51 day engage in psychological warfare use heavy military equipment against u citizen on u soil and now that the compound caught fire while they be pump in c gas after knock hole in the building disavows all responsibility big brother be not always right

                                                                                                         dear sir by now we be use to the new england journal of medicine  s publication of small scale study related to firearm from which conclusion be drawn which be quantum leap from the data follow by announcement of momentus    scientific    finding these be regularly release to the press without the caveat which riddle the conclusory paragraph and often accompany by an editorial call attention to the finding generally while they at least present a few interest data however meaningless the study misinterpret statistic and ignore or belittle serious study by criminologist the late effort       handgun regulation crime assault and homicide a tale of two city    by j h sloan et al  with the accompany editorial    firearm injury a call for science    by two employee of the center for disease control november 10 however be an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaw that i feel compel to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failing in no particular order 1  the author misleadingly cite wright et al ref 1 to support the statement that    some have argue that restrict access to handgun could substantially reduce our annual rate of homicide    wright et al  in fact study and reject that contention 2  the author pretend that vancouver and seattle be very similar city with similar economic circumstance history demographic characteristic and the like in fact the city be very different with very different demographic characteristic which appear to explain completely the high homicide rate in seattle both city be over three forths non hispanic white and  the non hispanic white homicide rate be report to be the same in seattle and vancouver  it be the different back  ground problem circumstance and behavior of the various ethnic minority which explain the difference in homicide 3  the author pretend they be evaluate canada  s gun law compare to washington state  s but they do not examine at all the situation in vancouver prior to the gun law take effect in 1978  a it happens in the three year prior to that 1975  1977 vancouver average 23 homicide per year one eighth involve handgun ref 2 and in the seven year of the nejm article there be 29 homicide per year one eigth involve handgun surely even the medical profession recognizes that one must look to see the prior situation be before conclude that a change make a difference would a physician conclude that a patient be benefiting from eat oat bran muffin each day for seven year because his cholesterol level be 200 without at least see if it be 180 before he start the regimen 4  the author pick two medium sized city to evaluate a national gun law nothing can be learn from such a tiny and arbitrarily select sample seattle appear to have be select because it be convienient for the author rather than for any scientific reason would physician call something a scientific study which involve one experimental subject and one dissimilar    control    have different arbitrarily select city be chosen opposite    scientific    conclusion would follow vancouver  s homicide rate  exceeds  that of such    wild west    city in texas a el paso corpus christi austen and in colorado colorado spring ref 3 5  the author fail to clearly demonstrate that firearm or handgun    be far more commonly own in seattle than in vancouver    they use two surrogate approach in pretend to study the availability of firearms handguns the first be an apples and oranges effort to compare the number of carry permit in seattle to the number of register handgun in vancouver but the number clearly understates the number of handgun in seattle and count primarily  protective  handgun owner the second however tell nothing about the number of handgun in vancouver and count  non protective  handgun for the most part where be it difficult to obtain handgun legally for protection registration figure be meaningless there be 66 000 register handgun in new york city new york daily news sept  27 1987 compare the two that method suggests about 930 handgun per 100 000 population in new york city compare to 960 in vancouver meaning vancouver have a great    prevalence of weapon    than new york city the second method of measure gun density be    cook  s gun prevalence index a previously validate measure of intercity difference    but the validation be by cook of his own theory ref 4 normally second opinion be sought from a different doctor more significantly the cook index be base on the average of the percentage of firearm involvement in suicide and homicide so the author be basically take a measure of misuse unsurprisingly gun misuse in homicide 42 in seattle 14 in vancouver be related to gun misuse in homicide plus suicide divide by two 41 in seattle 12 in vancouver the author be not measure the relative avail  ability of firearm or of handgun in seattle and vancouver 6  the author misstate the law of both washington and canada they neglect to mention the significant fact that washington have a wait period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun and that provision exist in canadian law for own and carry handgun for personal protection the author also make it appear that it be more difficult to get a handgun legally in canada than be actually the case 7  the author ignore all other factor which might explain the difference in crime rate beyond some vague mention of the penalities provide by law and the roughest of estimate of clearence for one particular offense    homicide involve a firearm there be no measure of the difference in the number of law enforcement officer their aggressiveness in make arrest for gun law violation in the two jurisdiction arrest rate for other offense conviction rate actual sentence impose for gun related crime violent crime without gun or gun law violation or incarceration rate whereas social scientist would attempt to measure and hold for such difference the author of the nejm    tale of two city    fail even to mention most factor related to crime control 8  the author dismiss claim that handgun be an effective mean for protection unless the criminal be kill such be not the case criminologist ref 5 8 have found that almost 650 000 american annually use handgun for protection from criminal and that use a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime    rape robbery assault    will be complete by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim it be interest nonetheless that the author report the same number four of civilian justifiable homicide without firearm in each city but that less restrictive seattle account for 100 of the report civilian justifiable homicide involve firearm 9  the center for disease control which fund the    study    editorially praise the paper ref 9 say it    apply scientific method to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocate of stricter regulation of firearm particularly handgun    there be nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for    scientific method    by a sociologist or criminologist the vancouver seattle    study    be the equivolent of test an experimental drug to control hypertension by find two ordinary looking middle class white male one age 25 and the other 40 and without first take their vital sign administer the experimental drug to the 25 year old while give the 40 year old a placebo then take their blood pressure and on find the young man have a low blood pressure announce in a    special article    a new medical breakthrough it would be nice to think that such a    study    would neither be fund by the cdc or print by the nejm since the longstanding anti gun bias of the nejm and the cdc make them willing to present shoddy research a    scientific breakthrough    in    special article    and editorial relate to firearm we be obligate to correct the record by notify the news medium and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activity of the center for disease control about the distortion contain in    handgun regulation crime assault and homicide a tale of two city    and    firearm injury a call for science    clearly all scientific standard go by the wayside whenever the cdc and the new england journal of medicine seize an opportunity to attack firearm ownership in america reference 1  wright jd et al  weapons crime and violence in america  a

market suggestive but what they conceal be vital    the problem be demonstrate by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purport to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide fund by the federal government and publish last year in the new england journal of medicine the study compare homicide rate in seattle and vancouver and suggest that a handgun ban    may reduce the rate of homicide in a community    the nine medical doctor who publish    handgun regulation crime assault and homicide    essentially reason in three step 1 despite many historical social and demographic similarity 2 vancouver have a markedly low homicide rate 3 because it stricter gun regulation make gun less available the second step in their reason seem indisputable the overall homicide rate in seattle for the period 1980 86 be 11 3 per 100 000 popuation compare with 6 9 in vancouver homicide be definitely more common in seattle the question then becomes why the author present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion a claimed in the third step of their reason that vancouver  s handgun regulation be much more stringent but their evidence on the difference in gun  availabilty  be indirect and unpersuasive indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point do not exist they offer two fragment of inferential data in support of the claim that gun be more available in seattle but for all anybody know a a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true we be therefore be ask at the conclusion of the study to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rate when a difference in gun availability have not itself be establish indeed the situation be even more troublesome the first of the two indirect bit of evidence be a difference between the number of concealed  weapon permit issue in seattle and the number of restricted weapons permit issue in vancouver difference between the two city in the permit regulation render these two number strictly noncomparable the second bit of evidence be    cook  s gun prevalence index    which stand at 41 percent for seattle but only 12 percent for vancouver cook  s index however do not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in various city it measure gun misuse    it be an average of the percentage of homicide and suicide involve firearm in the present case the index show only that in homicide and suicide firearm be more likely to be use in seatte than in vancouver to take cook  s index a a measure of general firearm availability it must be assume that the proportional involvement of gun in homicide and suicide be directly related to their relative availability in the general population but this be exactly what the author be seek to prove to assume what one be seek to prove then to    prove    it on the basis of that assumption do ot constitute scientific evidence for anything even if we be to grant on the basis of no compelling evidence that gun be less common in vancouver we might still question what cause what the author attribute seattle  s high crime rate to a high rate of gun ownership but it might well be argue that low crime or homicide rate reduce the motivation for average citizen to obtain gun    in other word that crime rate explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa in fact it be once commonly argue that great britain  s low rate of violent crime be a function of that nation  s strict gun law and the consequent low rate of gun ownership    until british researcher colin greenwood found that great britain have enjoy low rate of violent crime for many decade before strict firearm control be enact to invoke an ancient methodological saw correlation be not cause nor do the problem with this study end with it lack of direct data on gun ownership the author say seattle and vancouver be    similar in many way    imply that they differ mainly in gun availability gun law stringency and crime rate this be an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis    that    all else be equal    among thing be compare clearly the two city be similar in some way but a closer look reveals difference in way that be relevant to their respective crime or homicide rate the city be closely match in what percentage of their population be white 79 percent and 76 percent but seattle be about 10 percent black while vancouver be less than 0 5 percent vancouver  s minority population be overwhelmingly asian so although the author show that th two city be approximately comparable on a half  dozen readily available demographic indicator they have not show that all potentially relevant source of variation have be rule out in fact the difference in racial composition of the two city be particularly relevant in light of the study  s breakdown of homicide rate accord to the race of the victim for the white majority the homicide rate be nearly identical    6 2 per 100 000 in seattle 6 4 in vancouver the differ overall homicide rate in the two city be therefore due entirely to vastly different rate among racial minority for black the observe difference in homicide rate be 36 6 to 9 5 and for hispanic 26 9 to 7 9 methodoligical complexity render the asian comparison problematic but it too be high in seattle than in vancouver racial minority be much more likely to be the victim of homicide in seattle than in vancouver the white majority be equally likely to be slain in either city since the nearly 2 1 initial difference in homicide reates between the city be due exclusively to 3 1 or 4 1 difference between minority group it be fair to ask why postulate difference in    gun availability    or gun law strigency would matter so dramatically to minority but not matter at all to white can differential gun availability explain why black and hispanic    but not white    be so much more likely to be kill in seattle than in vancouver study in the united state incidentally do not show large or consistent racial difference in gun ownership or be other explanation more plausible could the disparity between canadian and american rate of poverty among racial minority have anything to do with it what be the relative rate of drug or alcohol abuse of homelessness among each cty  s minority population the city of seattle run the large shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi unemployment among young central city nonwhite men in the united state usually exceeds 40 percent what be the comparable canadian percentage the crucial point be that canada and the united state differ in many way a do city and population subgroup with the two country absent more detailed analysis nearly any of these    many way    might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rate in gross comparison such a those between seattle and vancouver all else be  not  equal the author of this study acknowledge that racial pattern in homicide result in a    complex picture    they do not acknowledge that the ensue complexity seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument they also acknowledge that    socio economic status be probably an important confound factor in our comparison    remark far that    black in vancouver have a slightly high mean income in 1981 than the rest of vancouver  s population    give the evidence present in the article it be possible that all of the difference in homicide rate between seattle and vancouver result from great proverty among seattle  s racial minority but the author pay no far attention to this possibility since    detailed information about household income accord to race be not available for vancouver    the largely insurmountable methodological difficulty confront in gross comparative study of this sort can be illustrate with a simple example if one be to take all u s  couties and compare them in term of 1 pervalence of gun ownership and 2 crime or homicide rate one would find an astonish pattern county with more gun have less crime would one conclude from this evidence alone that gun actually reduce crime or would one insist that other variable also be take into account in this example the    hidden variable    be city size gun be more common in small town and rural area whereas crime be a big city problem if researcher fail to anticipate this variable or lack the appropriate data to examine it possible consequence they coud be very seriously mislead in the study at hand the author match two city for size but not for minority poverty rate or other hidden variable and their result be impossible to interpret in the editorial    firearm injury a call for science    accompany the study two official from the center for disease control laud the author for apply    scientific method    to a problem of grave public heath significance but in attempt to draw causal conclusion from nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method be to anticipate plausible alternative explanation for the result and try to rule them out absent such effort the result may well seem scientific but be little more

         you spell there be no question about it we must be reading different public opinion poll i agree that the misguide public would like to see assault weapon ban mainly because they be be lie to by the medium about the frequency of their use in violent crime      1 but if public opinion be so dead set against the rkba you can bet that idiot like metzenbaum and schumer would be see their foolish bill get pass through congress a lot easy than they be and a government go broke and can no longer protect their citizen you can bet that the american people will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearm contrary to what you might think time be probably on our side not yours yeah right hold your breath my condolence on the discovery of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary gland but this have nothing to do with the issue at hand     ridiculous tripe delete     yeah the liberal press like u much but you really expect coherent thought from them anyway their opinion be base more on a desire to appear politically correct than on fact which be generously provide by the fbi if bother to put on their birkenstocks and go to the library to read them most of my friend be anti gun and without exception none of them base his her opinion on fact they would rather believe despite all evidence to the contrary that disarm law abiding citizen would make the world more civilize when all it really do be make u all sheep they would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how society have driven the criminal to rob rape and murder they support spending million of public dollar protect the right of scum who have already demonstrate that they have no regard for society or it law they ignore the fact that area with the strictest gun control nyc dc have the bad crime and area with little gun control vt nh id have very little crime in comparison but they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law abiding citizen who own gun be not the one that be cause most of the trouble in society oh no we certainly accept that but i guess i have faith that when crime start make significant inroad into their neighborhood and start directly hurt them and their family they will probably whistle a different tune they just well hope it too late then hmmm i expect company tonight i might be able to whip up a quick cheese and cracker plate but they should probably bring their own drink do i have time to vacuum the rug glad you end the post here your medication seem to have worn off                                                                                            lee gaucher nra my opinion gaucher sam cchem berkeley edu no one else  s

 iftccu talk politics guns mikey ccwf cc utexas edu strider 8 51 pm apr 12 1993 be watch this knife verse gun bit for a while now even contribute a few comment but this stuff    rather face a knife than a gun    have get to come from ignorance i use to think pretty much the same thing then i get  educated people do not a a rule understand how deadly knife can be or how quickly you can be kill with one most people understand that it take less than an inch of penetration in some area to cause quick within a minute or so death the death rate from handgun and knife be within a few percentage point of each other many people not realize how deadly knife be  try their luck and thus more get injured by knife a gun be deadly only in a single direction and only advantage be that it be a remote control weapon a contact weapon such a a knife control a spherical area 7 to 10 foot in diameter most people have never see knife wound aside from slice a finger by accident from 21 foot or so a knife be very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hand even if the knife wielder have only moderate skill from inside 10 foot or so a knife be a match for a drawn gun a knife be utterly silent it never jam and never run out of ammunition it be limited only by the speed dexterity skill and ability of wielder criminal in general be young fast and strong interest to note that the pattern slash attack use by many martial artist remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slash attack of novice talk to several well train martial artist they have unanimously agree that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on be cut hopefully not a bad a the attacker practice with firearm require facility and equipment practice with knife require only a small area and something to simulate a knife say a popsicle stick or tooth brush criminal practice their knife attack in prison if you have not train against knife with a firearm and do not realize these fact the first inkling you will have that something be wrong be the knife rip through your throat or in the case of an experienced attacker part of your body fall off onto the ground a 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half second dennis tueller with a broken leg in a walk cast manage it in two see people close that distance and strike in 1 second old over weight and slow i can do it in 1 3 second see morgue footage of people kill with edge weapon that you would not believe how about a single stab wound to the chest with a table fork in this case the attacker use the handle not the point end add to this the  fact that hand gun  stopping power be largely a myth except in the case of a central nervous system shot or a round that destroys the skeletal structure it take anywhere from 3 to twelve second for a bullet wound to  take effect this be true of even heart shot there be the case of the police woman in l a  the first record survivor of a  357 shot to the heart that lady not only kill her attacker but chase him down to do it all four of her shot fire after she have be shot struck the perp atta girl the bullet enter her on a downward angle go through the apex of her heart down through the diaphragm clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen it then exit her back leave a tennis ball size hole she die about six time on the operating table but be out of the hospital in 15 day and be back on full duty in eight month she be off duty at the time and not wear her vest she be on her way home so happen to have her gun no she think civilian should have the same right sigh the moral of the story be that even if you do manage to shoot a knife attacker well be planning on do some dodge a good alternative be to shoot for and break the pelvis people can often walk a little on broken leg but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them many firearm school recommend pelvis shot against contact weapon the target be a large a the traditional  center of mass and be more reliable to stop somebody with a contact weapon assume a caliber powerful enough to  do the job hot  38  s on up will usually do this remember folk the idea to  take em with you but for you to live and them to fail whatever the consequence for them this the reason  killing them our goal or in many case even good enough to keep u alive i want to face a violent attack of any sort know what i now know i rightly say rather face a knife than an gun it would have to depend on the attacker and if i could pick and choose i would n t be there this be really the bottom line criminal do not fear the law criminal do not fear the weapon they fear the citizen behind the weapon that have show the resolution and determination to do whatever it take
 money order operate pretty much like check with both party be suppose to sign them i assume have to show the buy back people an id and then have a money order make out to that id a far a traceable a a practical matter i know it would depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient  s name be on the money order and bother key that sort of thing in say certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who they give money order out to there might be some question ask i suppose if somebody brought in a number of weapon each time over a series of    buy back    program
     well chalk one up for drive away sympathy by look like a paranoid lunatic last i heard there be nine apparently a of this point they ve found no body except those kill during the initial assault a couple of month ago be cute if koresh hit the trail maybe he be bodily assume into heaven that just make ag reno  s day
 in the late case in denver they be give away ticket to a denver nugget basketball game how traceable be a money order i know use one in 20 year be that even an issue if the weapon checked for be steal

 oldham ces cwru edu daniel oldham babble what happen in waco be not the fault of the batf if they would of have the proper equipment and personal then they could of capture the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happen if go to the door and knock on it to serve the warrant like the sheriff have do 3 other time they have need to have an initial assault but then herr klinton and attorney gen l reno have be able to have told such heroic story about how they    protect    the rest of u from a group of people who kept to themselves mile out in the prairie the batf need more people well weapon and more armored transport when they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreat to a stand off if you be go to do a job then do it right the batf be there to protect u and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job the batf need to be disband this out of control group of rambo wannabee be a danger to the republic with the wod and the increase crime in the street the batf be need more now then ever if they blast away a few good fokes then that be the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country well i figure go to get flame pretty badly by everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement so i ll just let it pas for now case western reserve huh do the fed know about that big stockpile of automatic weapon and crack you have in your house be you the same daniel oldham that life on orchard drive just so they get the address right that be     look at all the good people that die in war to protect this great country of ours well it use to be a great country now not so sure i knew a few of those good people who die in war i be in viet nam i can assure you none of u fought to protect the right of the government to attack it own citizen with military force without provocation hint serve a search warrant be not sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault on a religious group at least not here in the u maybe in iraq or syria     with the arm build up in waco they need to hit that compound with mega fire power they could of go in there blasting and kill a few woman and kid but it would of be well then let them all burn to death 51 day later
 steve nice that you find me laughable but i quite understand be it because you think my firearm clash with what wear or that my nra sticker on straight please state your judgement i find it sad that people accept the responsibility to defend themselves and i laugh with the same contempt you have for me at the sheep who expect the government to protect them you and your friend sound like a bunch of smug intellectual oh i guess you be still wait for you all knowing academic likes to solve the world problem let u know when you have the answer or punch line a this case may be so not a    yankee    thing be canadian actually a uncivilized a we american well if anything like here it matter if they do they be able to use them you waste your time watch tv steve it will corrupt your mind ditto to you self righteous one lay your derogatory tirade on thick steve y all can keep laugh and i  ll keep feel safe and secure
 for goodness sake if they have fire a cruise missile at the compound more people would have come out alive it be obvious to anyone with the remotest contact with reality that such an outcome be likely not just possible however the fire start a mr lawnmower you seem to have already enter your own little virtual reality i guess you be expect to understand thing in the real universe
 no chance if that c ignite at all it would have be quite similar to a grain bin explosion explosion i note the entire compound would have be level not merely burn a there be no explosion there be no c ignition cause the fire note at five mile a decent grain elevator explosion will knock you on your butt and your ear will ring for day i speak from experience here
 for those of you interested i just finish talk with a representative of senator bob krueger  s reelection campaign about his position on the rtkba krueger be appoint by the democratic governor of texas to complete lloyd bentsen  s unexpired term the representative say that senator krueger do not have a position and would only comment on specific legislation that be pending no comment be available on the various version of the brady bill
 hi just finish reading s414 and have several question about the brady bill s414 and hr1025 1 _are_ these the current version of the brady bill what be the status of these bill heard    in committee    how close be that to be make law 2  s414 and hr1025 seem fairly similar be there any important difference i miss 3  s414 seem to have some serious loophole a  s414 specify an    appeal    process to wrongful denial during the wait period other than a civil lawsuit s414 have an appeal process once the require instant background check system be establish but not before b  the police be explicitly not liable for mistake in denying approving use exist record so who would i sue in    a    above to have an inaccurate record correct c  s414 include an exception to waiting period clause for if a person can convince the local chief law enforcement officer cleo of an immediate threat to his or her life or life of a household member but s414 say exactly what be consider a    threat    nor do it place a limit on how long the cleo take to issue an exception statement true have i misunderstood any other  holes 4  with just s414 what  s to stop a person with a    clean    record from buying gun grind off the serial number and sell them to crook at minimum what additional law be need to prevent this  seems at min a    gun counting    scheme would be need e g     john doe own n gun    so if s414 pass i be surprised to see legislation for stricter harder to forge i d  s plus national gun registration justified by a need to make the brady bill work please comment mainly interested in specific problem with the current legislation    i mean to start a general discussion of the merit of any all waiting period bill ever propose
 i agree sad but true please name one     upon which our bill of right be base some delusion if this be not true in practice then certain unethical politician would not be passing gun control law politician be generally whore to public opinion this do not mean the the public be either well inform or correct a for the stats anyone can support anything with the right stats the    right    stats from what see be sometimes even use to support conflict side of the same issue use to own firearm while arm insurrection a the ff  s of the const may have envision seem to me a somewhat fanatical approach to avoid this political protest be still an option at this point i agree that argueably not enough and or too late if all else fails there  s always pvc pipe and cosmoline    chris miller chris morningstar com
 no the issue be reduce crime not gun if gun control low crime overall then be address the issue do that matter if assault with a baseball bat become much more common mugger use a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun and rarely shoot their victim a mugger use a knife be much more likely to start by stab his victim in an effort incapacitate him so while a knif may not be a deadly a a gun criminal be more likely to actually _use_ the knife a oppose to threaten the victim with it it at all clear that replace the criminal  s gun with a knife would reduce murder stabbings might just become more common why it be important to look at the overall not the with gun homicide rate it avoids the issue of substitution different criminal techinques of use different weapon etc     and measure what we want to prevent murder    face    possibly however face knife welding attacker too common stab without warn and by supprise be the usual tactic very few criminal shoot from cover it attracts to much attention and they have a chance to go through your pocket overall much rather be threaten with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife actually the exact same statement be true of gun training in unarmed self defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem you also ignore the criminal  s reaction the national crime survey clearly show that criminal unarmed arm with a knife gun or whatever be unwilling to risk their life in a confrontation if face with a serious threat almost all prefer to leave and find an easy target therefore use or threaten to use a be much more commonly the case a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker regardless of how he be arm knife however be much less effective than gun criminal consider knife a a    serious threat    nearly a often a they do gun
 the issue have never be whether tank be use in detroit in 1967  it have be whether they fire their main gun never this be incorrect either you read very well or resort to falsehood in an attempt to make a point at the risk of boring and belaboring the point my claim be the chain be regard the tank    last use in detroit in 48    the text follow you do not merely claim that tank be use    you claimed that they fire their main gun to suppress sniper fire and that they be    quite    effective at this indeed when coffman claimed they be only use a apc i do say i have be told they do fire their main gun               you continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody be dispute well the poster who i respond to do dispute the use of tank post 48 rude of you to call gary coffman a nobody    well not the main gun    gee only the entire point be you now go to admit that you be wrong that be the entire point to  you  what exactly do i claim                                                                               heard eye witness description of tank use their main gun to respond to sniper fire quite effectively                                                                               i wrong heard those description if pay attention mention that i saw the tank with my own eye but the main gun fire be an account i heard that help people judge whether or not to kick in the to use your word    bullshit filter    state that i  claimed  this be a falsehood what be it i claimed a fact here  s the entire post                                                                            correction i know they use tank in detroit 1968  i saw em it be well cover in the news at that time gordon lightfoot mention it in his song    black day in july                                                                               since you dispute that and claim that nobody else do that mean i be right i will never read of tank fire their main gun in detroit in the  67 riot there be simply no way that such an event could have take place without it be common knowledge even 26 year later the american military fire shell from tank in american city on black would have be  big  news so one would suppose some folk think in happen in 48  awesley go on you can also read of the troop use grenade launcher to fire fragmentary grenade i doubt that a well to fire concussion grenade perhaps to fire tear gas certainly but you would be perfectly willing to let u believe they fire frags you since it make your other claim seem more plausible john again strawman technique do you feel lose it so you have to stretch what i say and knock that down what i read say nothing about what they fire and so i put nothing in there if you need some help let me know and i l take your side of this for a while not score here boring here if tank have fire their main gun in detroit people would have be scream about it for the past two and half decade i would know about it glad to know such an expert nice to hear some an authority i especially appreciate your basis of knowledge    if it have happen you would have know it since you be such an authority you probably know that people do scream about an allege massive cover up in the number of people kill in the detroit riot some claimed 100  dead others say 300  the offical number be 43 but the concise columbia encyclopedia say it be    several    also heard some thing about that but i dare repeat them assert that i claimed they be truth unless you also claim that the national guard manage to cover it up take the tour after the riot it be pretty easy to tell the difference between army and guard troop or so i recall from 26 year ago and i seem to recall it be the army run the tank so it would have be an army cover up another part of my memory be that while most damage building be burnt some be in rubble base on what i remember i be and be inclined to believe an old sarge or two if your mind be open enough to believe that well good for you i prefer to live in reality and here in reality i find it hard to believe that those tank even have any shell much less fire them give the level in destruction in detroit quite willing to believe that they do fire their gun now then bore the shit out of anyone whose bother to read this far and all manage to say be that you believe the account i cite    john l  scott
 kratz comment above show otherwise bingo now the question be do the glock  s qualify let  s see the evidence that kratz us but first an aside have an air gun prof nothing moreover my comment be base on what kratz writes free to argue that he babble in text but actually know something off line harder than what i note that almost all revolver work the same way so it be    harder than revolver    sure they can moreover we know now that kratz sample be unrepresentative we can look at the reason it be basically    these glocks be dangerous because not like my 1911 s w third generation    part of that be true but since those same people claim that revolver which share the relevant property be dangerous we see that the argument fails why would i care not look for more bogus reason one can make hundred of simple statement without have anyone    get right on your as    one merely have to make accurate simple statement then you get    attaboy    s by mail and publically accuracy be a severe burden but most of u manage it  andy

 how about    firearm related    texas be unusual in this regard it would be nice to reduce them both though a texas appear to have an murder rate that much high than the national average i would expect it be a result of a much high suicide rate be nice if you have to suffer at all here  s where we run into a problem i be perfectly willing to have government regulation on something which be likely to cause others harm what discuss though be the extreme regulation of a large group in order to target a small group and i think appropriate do this then justify anything at some point you have to draw a line at least to my way of think where the government must have something a little more substantial than a set of percentage with which to punish an individual where do  you  draw the line or be there one virginia it pass do it cute analogy the u s  treat drunk drive like a serious crime however we also confiscate car of people who drink we also confiscate  all  car because some people drink and drive the core of the legal system that in order to punish an individual and call property confiscation a punishment you must have evidence against that individual that be it enough to show that the majority of people convict of murder be white in order to convict a particular white guy of murder huh

 post by cathy smith for l  neil smith letter to a liberal colleague author  s note    adrian       name change to protect the guilty    and the author be science fiction novelist who once work with the same editor at a famous new york publishing house dear adrian way behind schedule on my current book again so this reply to your note    criticize the recent magazine interview i give and generally attack gun ownership    will necessarily consist mostly of assertion free to believe or not i can back with evidence and logic neither time nor energy to present now write fully on this topic before and will again in the future when i do i  ll make sure you get copy there be many argument i might make from the futility and danger of delegate self defense to the police see don kates in the jan  10 1985 wall street journal to the real effect of prohibition shift consumer from newly outlawed handgun or semiautomatic rifle to item like sawed off shotgun or homemade bomb but i  ll limit myself here to comment on the newspaper clip you sent with your note first the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to argument ground in social utility second publication of some latter day    scientific study    alter the fact that the gun prohibitionist i discuss in my interview    annoy you so much in the process    be lie third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to argument ground in social utility fourth a often happens with these thing the    study    support the gun prohibitionist original numerical contention anyway but simply add a new layer of spurious claim to an old body of lie omission and distortion fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to argument ground in social utility sixth the fact that gun prohibitionist have be caught lie on countless occasion carl bakal author of no right to keep and bear arm even confess to it publicly make the value of this present    study    dubious to say the least seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to argument ground in social utility eighth give your own lifelong service a a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction you should be well aware than most people how    progress       in design    study    to prove whatever you want    outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data a case in point we might agree on be the fact that it take another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 year to create    study       prove    that pornography cause crime more naive and probably more honest effort in the 50 and 60 clearly indicate the contrary ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to argument ground in social utility tenth another reason to doubt all such    study    be that human behavior a the austrian school of economics demonstrates be far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantify the attempt to do so    and then create public policy base on the result pseudo information    be wreck our civilization eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to argument ground in social utility twelfth the    study    be also worthless because it incorporates figure for suicide which be not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometimes with ancillary social benefit if anything perhaps suicide intervention should be a criminal offense thirteenth and finally the national rifle association official quote in the article whatever their shortcoming and they be many be correct in this instance the    study    be meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice be a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right    subject neither to the democratic process nor to argument ground in social utility and because of that adrian even if the    study    be valid it deter me from a lifelong personal objective of see that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desire without ask anybody  s permission in this ably assist by gun prohibitionist themselves whose yawp invariably move previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun    while they still can    before the  68 gun control act most of the    shoot fraternity    view handgun incorrectly a it turn out a inaccurate ineffective toy there probably six million of them in the whole country now thanks to kennedy metzenbaum the brady and their ilk    america  s great sport good sale team    we probably manufacture at least that many every year the fascinate datum be that handgun control et al be perfectly aware of this    so i guess have to ask them yourself what their real motif be look gun making an arcane or difficult art and by the way easy to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self loading pistol be the only thing which keep me from pursue this far even if it be difficult there be already a quarter billion firearm in america with an estimate    half life    of 1000 year    possibly more for stainless steel gun be gon na be around a long time adrian whether you like it or not a for me to paraphrase elmer keith regardless of what the law provide or any court decides always go to be arm and i will always work to see that others be a well the bad news be that there be thousand more    perhaps even hundred of thousand    where i come from we be stop by passing law we can only be force to arm ourselves and others secretly and    give both the practical and allege difference between full automatic and semiautomatic    perhaps more efficiently

 kill by handgun or kill if dead i much care if it be by be shot or stabbed to death i think you can get an accurate indicator of how safe england be compare to switzerland by concentrate only on handgun murder and completely ignore murder by other weapon not to mention the rate of other violent crime if there be more gun in circulation if follow that more people will be kill with them  cause they be available to the person intent on commit a crime _regardless_ of whether they have to do it with a gun knife or bare hand the gun control lobby seem to understand this point if people be intent on commit a crime they will do it with whatever mean be available to them
    this statement simply amazes me    through no fault of atf the element of surprise be lose    what element of surprise in the paragraph precede this one he say        the special agent announce who they be and their purpose for be at the compound    which be to serve the federal warrant no element of surprise be even need for that no the element of surprise that they lose be that need for a preemptive first strike without warn read they need to wait until they see how it come out before they fabricate anymore which could get disproven a always no fact just my opinions observations jim    jmd handheld com
 this be a co authored report from two of u who be there gun owner action league our state rifle association start the day with a rally in the seclude courtyard behind the statehouse at 9 30  it be look sparse about 40 people until the speaker begin whereupon about 120 more people follow the loudspeaker from wherever they have be lose and fill out the area something proud mike yacino of goal spoke one of his best throwaway line be to remind u that all of u holder of carry permit there have be checked and certify clear of all crime by the state while the people in the statehouse behind u only have to be certify clean of    election fraud    to hold their job nancy snow and amos hamburger be busy hand out id button and sheet describe all the bill to be present at the hearing and tell people where to find their own representative and in too many case who they be mike warn u that the committee be go to suspend it rule and discus a bill that make it onto the official list it seem a delegation of student from simon  s rock of bard college alma mater of wayne lo who shot up the place with an sks late last year be be buss in to testify for a bill to ban all sale of firearm or ammo to anyone who be not a state resident the hearing be originally schedule in the large gardner auditorium at 10 30 but that have be pre empted by the governor s hearing on the framingham eight woman in prison for kill abusive husband and seek release so we have until 1 30 to buttonhole our representative after which we would be squash into an inadequate hearing room one of my representative staffer be somewhat offensively smarmy he say    oh it must be gun hearing day again the gun lobby be always so organize every year    i get a little piss and reply    not from the gun lobby    from your district    at 12 30 your second reporter arrive in time to notice a demonstration go on in front of the statehouse where the pro gunners randy price from the tv news be there in his mirror reflective shade talk to one of the anti gun type and several simon  s rock anti gun    close the loophole    protestors earlier randy have cover the goal rally the room we have be assign seat about 50  remember there be about 160 gun owner there plus another 20 30 student and teacher from bard one of u have already reserve a seat the other never get closer than the atrium outside    and there be a crowd behind him a cop take up station at the entrance and prevent the rest of the crowd from come in soon after the debate start a loudspeaker be set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else everyone who be there inside and outside get to sign up on a sheet say what their position be on which bill most of u sign up to    support goal  s position    on    all bill    first because of their time constraint public official get to testify and first up be the bill that nobody have see the student have some curfew i guess currently massachusetts law allows a non resident to purchase long gun or ammo from a local dealer provide he complies with the law of his own state previously the law be similar but apply only to non residents from state adjoin massachusetts the simon  s rock folk call the current law a    loophole    and want it close two of their rep spoke about wayne lo and his    sks assault rifle    the second one hodgekiss a co sponsor have do his homework so well that he kept confuse montana wayne lo  s home state with missouri and become belligerent when about five gun owner in the gallery correct him after his second muff carr from gloucester claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it be but he be lie the new bill allows purchase by non residents of adjoin state only if they have licensing in their own state    a strong a    that in massachusetts since none of them do that some of the thing these two say be really offensive    in some of these other state anyone can buy a gun a long a breathing    oooooo    we have some very very good gun law in massachusetts if only the other state would adopt the same type of law we be have this situation    but they    naughty naughty next up be boston city councilman albert    dapper    o neill he be there to testify pro gun but in some way he be a liability reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself plus almost a caricature of a law n order politician he badmouth the aclu say violent criminal should be execute and that if he be judge give arrestees their    last right    pun intend on the spot at which many of the gun owner applaud which bother me he say that all the propose gun restriction be a step in the right direction    for the criminal he say this four time two of the bill under consideration would allow police to rescind a ccw or fid and confiscate all your gun if someone have file a restrain order against you note that the filing of a restrain order require no warrant no hearing no evidence and no conviction    just an accusation senator barrett of reading testify in favor of it and patronize the pro gunners there several time by say    sure all the gun owner here will agree with me that we have to get these weapon out of the hand of people that our court have convict    i see such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since nixon whine that he a crook barrett also spoke in favor of the bill make the fid card renewable every five year instead of permanent a it be now the state purpose be to remove fid card from those who have become ineligible    revenue have nothing to do with it    yeah right apparently some congressman think stupid enough to swallow the argument that preferable to process 1 6 million renewal every cycle in the vague hope of catch a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time a usual hassle the law abiding instead of the crook the two co chairs of the committee be rep  caron and sen  jujuga jujuga say much he be a co sponsor of both    restrain order    bill but caron struck me a a sharp guy that let any bad logic or lie on the part of either side to go unchallenged he be a co sponsor of one of the    restrain order    bill a well one of the young rep on the committee forgot his name be vociferously pro gun somewhat embarrassingly so his heart be in the right place but his argument seem to be confine to    every year the same damn thing you come in here with this crap        nice to have a friend on the committee but he could have be more effective at about 3 00 it be clear that the hall jam continue someone come out of another meeting hall and yell at the cop because the loudspeaker be disturb their meeting so the loudspeaker be disconnect so they found a big hall upstairs one of u have to leave to catch his charter bus and so miss the    public    testimony the other get a seat this time caron begin by talk about how he get his fid 16 year ago left the state and then return without notify them of his address change he complain that the state record system be not up to date and that his pd back in his city of birth still thought he live there great quote    if you purchase a gun today it will not get into the state computer system until 1999    this be also an argument he use against the renewable fid card testimony be heard from several    batter woman    one of whom have be attack by some guy in his 20  s who have an fid card because he get it when he be 15 or thereabouts they use a lot of emotion and say how they be scar of these men a staffer of attorney general harshbarger testify in favor of this anti gun bill say how 50 000 restrain order be grant last year and how these woman need to be protect caron note that a restrain order be grant for 10 day and then a hearing be held to determine whether the order would be extend to a year he ask whether she would be satisfied if the fid be revoke at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the fid she give some long ramble circumlocution in response then testimony against the bill be heard mike yacino who look something like einstein get up and make the point that restrain order be issue on too little evidence that judge like to issue restrain order just to let thing cool off no matter who they think be right man or woman and that the hearing for restrain order be lightning session with little time to consider fact atty karen mcnutt spoke with him a few time during his testimony other pro gunners get up to testify one say he have have to file a restrain order against a tenant to clear her out and that she counter by filing one against him he note that this would have allow the state to confiscate his gun if the new bill become law one of the junior rep note that    this be america    and we have to be certain that individual right be respect senator jujuga reiterate this say that    people who abuse small people can go to hell a far a i care but we have to be careful about equate conviction with a restrain order    point and match senator another pro gunner get up and testify that he know his citizenship    expire every 5 year    and that a driver  s license be a privilege not a right like the right to keep and bear arm a third get up and say the problem be with the criminal justice system and argue in favor of a death penalty bill and public hanging senator jujuga say he have himself try to get a death penalty bill pass and joking respond that he too favor public hanging the speaker then respond    i  ll make you a deal you get me the rope and i  ll tie the noose    next come public testimony on the simon  s rock bill a teacher testify that she have be the teacher of wayne lo and that    he have be able to shoot people inside a building while he be outside    without his evil gun she say that the    loophole    should be close to prevent something like this from    ever happen again    four or five other kid testify in favor of this bill one of spill tear for the good legislator one of the student actually shot by wayne lo be also there many of them have t shirt on say    a long a one person can buy a gun in anger none of u be safe    support gun control    the committee be reluctant to grill or correct the kid except for caron who correct one student who have claimed that anyone could apply for an fid    only resident can get fid  s    he say how much do you want to bet that this kid have no idea he have be con into testify for a bill that would cut out of staters completely off yacino and mcnutt spoke again this time note that the bill a write would affect both ammo and all gun possess by out of staters karen also note that hunter in ct nh and vt could be put away for a year if they wander across the ma boundary somewhere in the wood and get challenged by game warden yacino underscored the fact that lo could have gotten an fid a a resident student    and hell even an ccw a he have no criminal or mental record one junior rep be upset that it would take ma resident longer to buy a gun than out of staters and thought it be    elitist    another caron say that we need the protection of prevent non residents from buying without an fid because only two other state in the union have    fid type    card so comply with all the law of one  s home state be    not enough    one pro gun speaker reply that this resemble a mother watch her son in a march band and exclaim    everyone  s out of step but johnny    all the bard college people be filing out a the pro gun testimony for this bill be make and thus only pro gunners be around when the other bill come under consideration the main bill remain and goal  s position be o h 4375 and four others notify police chief so they can pull license when a holder be convict strongly support o h 1732 require trigger lock on all handgun sell oppose o h 962 require trigger lock on all load firearm strongly oppose o h 1350 allow every municipality to enact their own gun law oppose o h 1731 fund bullet proof vest for municipal police support o s 1097 state constitutional amendment for the rkba support o several on police discretion in the issuance of fid card oppose o several alter non resident license condition support o h 1135 ban damn near all gun everywhere in the state guess some of these take only 30 second to consider a the remain pro gunners raise hand in unison either for or against them mike yacino note that besides the danger in screw with a trigger lock on a load gun that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his conceal handgun unless it be lock caron blew right through h 1350 when he saw that we oppose it again he brought up the state  s archaic record capability and say    this would create hundred of different licensing system    the session ran late    since it be the last schedule hearing it could not be adjourn until everyone who want to have testify it end at about 6 30
 i sign any blank check when doug foxvog say    weapon of mass destruction    he mean cbw and nuke when sarah brady say    weapon of mass destruction    she mean street sweeper shotgun and semi automatic sks rifle when john lawrence rutledge say    weapon of mass destruction    and then immediately follow it with     what do rutledge mean by the term
 well put jim i be a concerned about the medium  s complicity in this grow coverup can you imagine the medium outrage the lawsuit the investigation that would emit if the government kept the medium away from any other story particularly if a republican administration have be behind it what  s go on here let  s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happen next a student of human phychology particularly in the area of psy ops because found some of the technique to be useful in business negotiation that put me firmly in the amateur rank this amateur know that the first thing to do when size up the opponent be to do a psychological profile on him you can bet your as the fbi have professionally do profile on koresh koresh  s behavior be emminently predictable it be typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation it would also be typical give koresh  s religious orientation for such an individual to interpret a government assault a the apocalypse suicide be a an acceptable alternative to be consume in the apocalypse imho the fbi knew all this and decide after 50 day of concentrate psy ops to initiate that apocalypse i believe they chose a course of action design specifically to push koresh over the edge while publicly appear to be act reasonably they knew that koresh consider the tank to be the chariot of fire mention in the book of revelation they knew that send tank oops combat engineering vehicle obstensibly to perform    gas insertion    love that newspeak would push him over the edge look at some support evidence koresh  s attorney mention on tv earlier today 4 20 that one of koresh  s major concern be the biblical role of the tank station around the compound the fbi through reno on larry king last night and at the news conference this morning claimed to have listen device in the compound if that be true they knew their action be drive him to the brink they knew they be push the davidians toward mass suicide any rational and reasonable agency not interested in kill those people would at the first sign of preparation for suicide have pull completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor instead they continued with the    gas insertion    right up to the point where flame appear the image that will remain etch in my mind be that of the tank strut back and forth in front of the burning compound gloat over the kill let  s step back and ass how this thing could have be end without bloodshed this technique would have require a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforce the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieve a military victory and of vengence the way to have nabbed koresh be simply to have announce a pull back abandon the assault torn down the concertina wire and remove the armor maintain covert surveillance of the compound and then exploit his ego to flush him out exploit his ego would have be simple a simple invite or two from the tabloid talk show to come on tv and tell how he whip the u government would have be something he could not have resist he could have then be nabbed when he left the compound simple clean and safe but because it would have require the fbi to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprive them of the revenge they sought it be totally out of the question not without all that testesterone float around after all jannet reno have to show the world how big her ball be yesterday be a sad sad day for the american system i be sick to my very soul john

 a perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing work the local college newspaper have a big crusade to have the u t police release crime stats the school claimed that to do so would violate federal education record privacy law they swore up and down they interested in student discipline record only for stats so people could make an evaluation of how safe the campus be it be barely a week after crime stats be release before the daily beacon have an editorial call for student disciplinary stats to be release because they complain certain segment of the campus population be treat administratively rather than turn over to the police and therefore the criminal state accurate what people say they want public today may not be what they say tomorrow

 a i understand it be consider unsafe for the tv network to get any closer surely the network can judge the risk of reporting for themselves i notice cnn be ban from baghdad hotel yet despite the all too real risk of have a cruise missile land in the lobby incidentally have that ever be explain or be we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off course missile just happen to hit that hotel at a probability of about 1 in some very large number unsafe for who i wonder
 i think the point be be miss that it be apparantly acceptable for big government big brother to use tank to control the people a long a they use the big gun but everything else be allright     tank deployed against civilian let alone fire on them with crew serve weaponry a  50 heavy machine gun be crew served be something both our press and government howl about instantly when do in some other country against civilian that have at most one shot at a time light small arm certainly nothing that place the people in or behind the tank in any real danger molotov coctails a round from a rifle or pistol deal with anybody approach with one of those and    sniper    too often turn out to be stray from other cops guard army gunfire i know about the other people in this group or on the net but the idea of tank be use to control civilian in anything that pretend to be a free society be outrageous when big government feel it be necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protest even violent of the citizen that suggests that the government be totally out of control since that be effectively the government declare war on it own people if the government be living up to it responsibility government of the people by the people not the  lords and other elite who want to keep their good thing go the citizen feel the need to be resort to act that need to be squash with a military boot people do thing like that because they have become convince that it be the only option that remains other attempt to have grievance redress have be ignore and yes there be a criminal element that will exploit this but the fact remains that the government have be unresponsive or such act be apt to happen still not an excuse to open up on civilian with tank heavy machine gun or whatever it the old  might make right philosophy that be the hallmark of a government go rogue they like it tough we will simply squash them under an iron boot actually address their grievance in other than token fashion with huge volume of hot air be just too inconvenient     sort of a variation on mushroom management keep them in the dark smother them with shit and crush them when ready     and these be the folk that many liberal be try to arrange thing so that they will have a monopoly on coercive force firearm that be than expensive toy     by gutting the bill of right cuz it just progressive or fit in with modern think anymore     unbelievable and i do believe amid the smoke confusion etc of a real riot situation that it would be possible for a tank to get away with fire the main gun into a building at close range one would hear an explosion among many explosion it be loud but it be not go to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke there would be a hole blown in the wall and some rubble but with tank knock over wall and other source of building turn into rubble and other cover racket such a gunfire include 50  s tack away it would not stand out that much and could be explain by    musta be a gas leak        i think it could be do and not be report under such condition it be possible it be not like a tank drive down a quiet street on a sunday afternoon turn and fire you know that would stand out and be pretty impossible to cover up

 two question when be this and do you have the relevant number please note this be  not  in any way an indication i believe you or that not correct but when the drop occur be relevant the primary objection beyond one base on the ideal of rkba that it be simply not something the government should do be that it make gun a play thing and tool of the rich and connect it discriminates against the poor be self defense consider appropriate and if so under what condition be you allow for instance to get a gun for protection if go to be carry a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have be threaten this have be suggest in the u s  and generally support among gun owner what many object to be that many if not most proposal contain a sort of    gotcha    clause which allows an arbitrary denial even if you qualify in every way at this point it should be point out that in general a driver  s licence in the u s  be for the most part nothing like it european counterpart i understand get one be far more difficult there than here in the u s  a joke but my usual objection be that discuss two different thing for instance in the u s  a driver  s license be a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road it be not necessary to own one or to operate it on private property that be the ability to require drive permit be generally consider to arise from the government  s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulation for behavior on public land a permit to own an automobile for instance which be far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get past legally since it be base on make regulation on public property but in restrict activity on private property this varies  widely  one thing i think european have a difficult time with be that the u s  have fifty unique jurisdiction where the law from one state to another can be a radically different a from one country in europe to another some place allow open carry of both gun and knife some allow conceal some prohibit both or allow one or the other and it can be either a state or local restriciton the question must be ask be the right of  this  individual affect the right of this  other  individual what we usually get be that the right of this  group  meaning some individual within this group here define a    people who own gun    be adversely affect the right of some other group if for instance    bob    be use his gun to attack    steve    have a point but essentially what discuss be that becuase some person who qualifies a a member of the group    people who own gun    then some third person perhaps in another  time zone  be told that their be a member of that group be take away somebody else s right like try to punish all newspaper for the libel commit by one the issue be crime violence and murder the question be to what extent gun and gun legislation impact those of course not it would be nice if we have to fear that other people might get it into their twist little mind to hurt u but currently we have that option nor do i expect we will no state do in any case there  s a limit to which the state may enforce    wisdom    on me freedom in general be an unwise concept if you pre emptively restrict everything which might be    unwise    then freedom becomes a meaningless concept i  ll raise my hand against driver  s license a currently implement a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the state and ignore by a startle number of driver it do not guarantee a level of skill any high than be necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else kill or a knowledge of traffic law beyond what any ten year old will have picked up rid around in his parent car but a i mention two different thing

 have read the post long article by jpfo i have some observation 1  this article do not claim that the gca of 1968 be a    verbatim translation    of a nazi law what it say be that in another place    the book talk about    they compare the two thing section by section the implication be that the similarity be devastate in the next sentence they talk about how in that book they reproduce the german text of the nazi law together with it translation not surprisingly a reader could easily conflate these two thing into a single idea that the american gca be a literal translation of the nazi law and sure enough what the whole thing have mutate into urban folklore style 2  the article go to great pain to establish that senator dodd have a copy of the nazi law either from his time on the nurnberg prosecution team or later this fact be consider highly incriminate but i understand why the author repeat several time that he be simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text and yet in a paragraph towards the end he explains it perfectly    if dodd get his copy of the original german text of the nazi weapon law during his time at nurnberg it likely be part of a collection of document for example issue of the reichsgesetzblatt the german law registry    bingo exactly dodd have a  book  with a series of nazi law in it include the one under discussion all of the stuff about    why would a u s  congressman have a copy of a nazi law    melt away by the author  s admission he then continue    but if he acquire the original german text of the nazi weapon law after his service at nurnberg he must have do so for a very specific reason        but there  s absolutely no reason to think that this be the case in fact a a    senior member of the u s  team that help to prosecute nazi war criminal    it seem to me that he would have  had  to have a copy all argument about whether the nazi weapon law be really of historical interest a it obviously be certainly accord to the author here or whether dodd personally prosecute the interior minister who sign it can be put aside a red herring 3  have establish that dodd own a copy of the original german text the jpfo article then try to draw sinister implication from the fact that he ask to have it translate the problem be in the context of the charge level at dodd these two thing work  against  each other people ask to have thing translate when they know what they mean  if dodd take it upon himself to preserve the nazi law with idea of someday introduce it into american law surely by 1968 he would have know what it  meant  he anyway this precise charge    the main one that i question in an earlier post    be just silly why would dodd need the exact translation for this purpose be the idea that the gun controller despite be presumably bent on disarm the populace with the goal of eventually destroy all civil liberty need a crib sheet they have any idea how to do it on their own once again the author provide a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question    dodd may have offer his copy of the nazi weapon law to show that the specific proposal do not resemble anything in the nazi law    in fact since the law and it translation  were  enter into the congressional record under the head of document    concern the history of nazism and gun confiscation    dodd  s motivation a mystery he ask for the translation in order to put it in the cr 4  even this article make it clear that the part of the nazi law that be add  by  the nazi regime be only a small part of that law registration of gun for instance be begin in 1928 and thus not a    nazi inspired    idea the part of the nazi law that parallel the 1968 gca include handgun control of some sort and the identification of certain weapon a sport weapon the jpfo then go on to list other part of the nazi law forbid ownership of weapon by jew of course there be no such provision in the american gca nevertheless in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the water immediately after the discussion of the anti jewish part of the law the jpfo article continue    give the parallel between the nazi weapon law and the gca 68           so a to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law
 not to mention last year  s weaver affair anyway here  s how i see the waco affair be interested in other peoples  interpretation     1  koresh and his people be basically mind their own business 2  some weapon violation may have be commit and i have disapprove of prosecute him for those violation however i think the batf be criminal for start negotiation with a military style assault and for fire into a house where there be child and other noncombatant 3  i see they just leave a token guard on the place and wait the bd out i approve of the tear gas approach and if it cause the fire to be start i think the fbi agent responsible should spend 10 20 year in jail 4  however if koresh  s response to the tear gas be to kill everyone there i hold him largely responsible for their death

 preliminary data regard similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in australia do not in any way support the cost effectiveness of this approach it _may_ be cost effective for deer    if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunt be _negative_ i e a profit because the majority of hunter pay for licence the cost comparison be probably be do assume that people have to be employ to cull the animal which be not in fact the case you figure people be go to pay for licence to implant contraceptive pellet or spread bait there have be a fair bit of discussion about this here recently because the kangaroo population in the ground of the governor  general  s residence have now reach plague proportion despite the whine of the rampant animal libbers the most effective method of control the population be still consider to be control shoot some people take satisfaction imho legitimate satisfaction in eat food that they have harvest themselves the pleasure derive from hunt be the same a that you get from eat fruit and vegetable grown in your own garden and in general game meat be probably much freer of unpleasant chemical than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket by    can not now be justified    i guess you mean that you personally see any justification fine    but what make your opinion so important certainly the last point be correct if politician see any vote for themselves in oppose stupid legislation or in develop and support measure which might be effective in reduce the incidence of violent crime they do these thing

 sorry for post this here but noone have reply to my post from the politics side of the group i want to get involve in the fight to save our gun right but first i need to get a little more educate be reading all the magzines and book i can get my hand on and sift through hundred of message here in the internet i want to obtain a complete list of senate bill and house resolution names numbers can anyone tell me how where to obtain this info surely there have to be a way to obtain copy of anti gun legislation from those  s in washington any help be appreciate
 in my case i be alive thanks to a gun that be provable   even in your twist logic no     wrong again brain trust   huh what planet be you from wrong     not a long a freedom remains    p get a dictionary
 the relevance be that if get x homicide and reduce the number of gun homicide in that group but x decrease by a significant amount have you make an improvement and be that improvement worth what paid if a baseball bat be a tenth a likely to kill a victim a a gun be that any comfort to that tenth face a knife and i be damn annoyed i  have  a gun all the statistic in the world change the fact that  he  be interested in cut  me     anyone train in self defense    unarmed self defense for everyone what  s more it require substantially more training to be safe and effective than a firearm it require physical proximity and thus a great threat to the victim which be a primary problem with stun gun you have to actually touch your assailant unless  very  good a large strong assailant can simply ignore your blow long enough to incapacitate you
 dennis deconcini 1982     in these and similar area the bureau have violate not only the dictate of common sense but of 5 u s c sec 552 which be intend to prevent    secret lawmaking    by administrative body these practice amply document in hearing before this sub  committee leave little doubt that the bureau have disregard right guaranteed by the constitution and law of the united state it have trample upon the second amendment by chill exercise of the right to keep and bear arm by law abiding citizen it have offend the fourth amendment by unreasonably search  ing and seize private property it have ignore the fifth amendment by take private property without just compensation and by entrap honest citizen with  out regard for their right to due process of law the rebuttal present to the subcommittee by the bureau be utterly unconvincing richard davis speak on behalf of the treasury department assert vaguely that the bureau  s priority be aim at prosecute willful violator particularly felon ille  gally in possession and at confiscate only gun actually likely to be use in crime he also assert that the bureau have recently make great stride toward achieve these priority no documen  tation be offer for either of these assertion in hearing before batf  s appropriation subcommittee however expert evidence be submit establish that approximately 75 percent of batf gun prosecution be aim at ordinary citizen who have neither criminal intent nor knowledge but be entice by agent into unknowning technical violation exerpt from 97th congress 2d session committee

of alcohol tobacco and firearm atf which be the federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearm violation and regulation it have be my experience a chairman of the appropriation subcommittee on treasury postal service and general government which fund atf that atf be one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agency in the federal government the agent of atf have proven their value again and again in successful legal operation to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearm especially in the area of drug related crime it enforces the arm career criminal act which call for mandatory minimum sentence for repeat felon use firearm to carry out an illegal activity the bureau have make itself a key component in prevent gang related violence also both by educate at risk youth to the danger of gang membership a well a s by deprive know gang from access to weapon the waco texas case involve the execution of search warrant by atf on the branch davidians for illegal firearm and explosive possession automatic semi automatics and machine guns in addition to bomb and other explosive in virtually every gun case atf be ask to trace weapon through it national firearm trace center where they keep all dealer and federal firearm license information atf be the federal government firearm expert and routinely work with state and local police to execute warrant atf work with state and local law enforcement in texas and the u s  attorney office felt it be necessary to execute these warrant in order to legally establish that a crime have be commit and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosive held by member of the branch davidians in addition atf carefully select a sunday morning know from their source inside that the men would be separate from the woman and child and not in the area where it be know that the illegal weapon be store a you may be aware by now vernon howell a k a david koresh spiritual leader of the branch davidians be tipped of the impend execution of the search warrant unfortunately atf lose the element of surprise and the cult be able to arm themselves and prepare for atf entry into the compound once a hostage situation present itself the atf ask the fbi to become involve since the fbi be skilled in hostage negotiation in addition and military tank be brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the branch davidians base on what i have learn about atf  s role in the branch davidian raid i believe the agency act responsibly i be however deeply sadden by the loss of life of the 4 law enforcement agent who attempt to enter the compound and the civilian member of the cult i fully expect the department of treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representative from law enforcement outside the department to be head by the assistant secretary for enforcement in addition atf will conduct it own review of the waco operation i look forward to review the finding of the evaluator and hope this situation in waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion sincerely dennis deconcini chairman subcommittee on

 hm a previous poster argue that the fact that the bd  s do not rush to escape the burning building indicate that it be they and not any of the government action that start the fire on the other hand i wonder if with a face full of    massive amount of c     i  would be able to escape a burning tinder box like that ranch house assume my best effort
 the original question be about who start the fire and whether the    madman    be inside or outside the compound to which i reply on the possible sanity level of those inside and outside i paid my tax there be no reference to sex or religion on the form the comment above and below be meant to address who might be unstable enough to keep child in a building with tear gas or start a fire i agree that the batf handle the affair badly do you believe they would put impostor before the national tv camera at this point we be get conflict report from the survivor best wait til more light be shed upon them of course this be no good if you believe in eternal darkness
 well if police think they be so special that only _they_ be worthy of self defense perhaps we start put the arm on police maybe we should start demand that police be only police when on duty that after that they be just like the ordinary disarm helpless chump they consider    civilian    let  s prohibit arm carry by police when off duty or if they make the assertion that    well i need to maintain my gun    let  s make it regulation that they can carry an unloaded firearm home that only fair that they be just a helpless a poor schmuck come home from his computer operator job     nra director ex san jose cop leroy pyle state in the late swat magazine that anti cops well watch out for this schism between rkba folk and the police he asks the rhetorical question of  what if what  s left of the gun lobby start demand the disarmament of the police

 the briefing document for the raid have a notation on them about a similar local property which have sell for 800 000 prior to the raid if recent tv coverage can be believe the ventura county da come to the same conclusion in the report he release which lambast the sheriff  s office too bad the old man be nearly blind and take a few goose stepping drug warrior tm with him
 no but i have several other breakdown of accidental shooting never see one that specifically provide the info that davis insists that he have so love to have a cite wrong there  s one gun design where that can happen and it be suppose to be carry with the hammer over an unloaded chamber cock the gun turn the cylinder so that a load cylinder be under the hammer in other word it can be usefully carry in a safe manner other handgun design have that property if their trigger pull the hammer hit the fire pin the breakdown that i do have include the above category from them i can safely say that if davis be right in all of his claim a large negative number of people be kill by animal because we know that the number of killing by wacko be reasonably large and that the number of accident due to gun failure which be a superset of the described circumstance be near zero please do include a cite for those of u who like look at context make sure that your source excludes other type of accident and suicide that be misreported    gun cleaning accident    be police speak for    the family need the insurance money     andy
 every city and suburban police officer see around the twin city in the last two year have carry a semi auto of some type different brand though i see any glock  s with regard to this discussion we be get dangerously far from the usual ranting of t p g and close to the realm of r g but like to put my two cent worth in while there  s nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame s w in  357 magnum my favorite there be valid advantage to semi autos i suggest reading massad ayoob  s i know some people stand him and think full of bull but i think that in general his material be very valid and useful book _the semi auto pistol in police work_ or something like that he defines a number of way that semi auto  s be different and that    different be good    the main advantage be not in increase firepower but in more accurate followup shot when you go to single action mode there be also a certain    propriatory nature    of each gun that take some familiarity to learn this may have diminish with time a more criminal become familiar with different model of semi autos but it be cite a stop or at least slow down criminal who have grabbed a police officer gun yes but this be best do with a two hand hold with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action the da semi auto have the same advantage plus be always sa after the first shot not sure if this be meant to be different from your first point in a da semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try drop the hammer on the same round an advantage you have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discuss this point now this be fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation grant very rare but your round will now go off confine in the cylinder with no place to go slingshotting the slide on a misfire take very little time actually with modern revolver design incorporate hammer block this be not necessary or usually recommend a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the fire pin into the round to set it off the best speedloader user especially those use the spring load speed loader be very fast a problem be that eject the spent case be a two hand job where drop the expend magazine be one hand this mean that while you can be insert a fresh magazine a soon a the old one clear the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motion that will always take more time you also have the advantage of tactical reloads replace a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be use if need later yes the time to recognize the problem be just a important a the time to clear it really though in either a revolver or semi auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo be awfully small you be more likely to get a jam in a semi auto but even these be exceptionally rare with modern quality gun sigs glocks et al  all common semi auto  s can be carry with a round in their chamber without any safety problem while i put that out a a statement that i believe i should say that this applies to all of the one look at for the da semi  s no different from the revolver situation the gun all have hammer or fire pin block they also have a safety because there  s no real advantage carry one of these cocked and lock you have the same safety and speed of employment a a revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shot not familiar with sa semi autos except for the 1911 a1 i admit that i be initially skeptical about carry this cocked and lock but after examine the design try to defeat the safety gun unloaded of course and shoot it a lot i see no inherent safety problem with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer this design also get you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver yeah the infamous glock i still figure out how bad than a revolver for safety if you pull the trigger it go off i imagine that if all your revolver shoot be do double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before you realize it in addition if you have developed that nasty habit of keep your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and rely on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then have problem when the hammer there i think this be even okay for a riot a long a a small one b  i have the poor man  s beretta taurus 99 and consider it inferior a a carry weapon to the springfield  45 oops 9mm vs  45 argument be relegate to r g you be right though if you hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combination have fail i ascribe failure in the the fire real fast with a wonder nine scenario you mention to the gun this be a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training 9mm  s be become more popular with crook too though the  38 do still lead the list and like i say around here semi auto  s seem the rule for the street cop know about the state patrol however they may still carry the    highway patrolman    vincent please take any of this a a flame just my 0 02

 i think anyone be argue that there would be no effect but there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect you also have to consider the negative side law abide citizen arm with fireamrs pistol for the most part prevent between 80 000 national crime survey and 1 000 000 dr  kleck crime each year those be the extreme most study find the number to be 500 000 to 600 000 about 1 of those crime be homicide so private ownership of firearm _saves_ approximately 5 000 life each year there be roughly 12 000 criminal homicide and fatal accident involve gun each year for there to be any net benefit you would have to show that gun control measure would disarm over 40 of the criminal currently use gun that would be very hard to do accord the the federal batf only 8 of criminal buy their gun over the counter since gun control law by their very nature only effect legal sale such a law would remove all the benefit of arm law abiding citizen while have only a minimal effect on arm criminal who by and large get their gun illegally that sound like a net benefit to me since most be with license weapon i assume you be not support    reasonable    law i e wait period background check license etc     since only a complete ban would alter the statistic you refer to i assume what you be support by the way 1135 people dy in 1986 from fall down stair 250 accidental handgun death significant next to other household accident 1080 child under the age of 10 die by drown 69 from drinking poisonous household chemical like drano 139 from fall if the real goal be to reduce the tragic accidental death of child a ban on drain cleaner be a well palce to start or perhaps restrict ownership to professional like plumber while you might call it    emphasis    refer to completely two statistic in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison if it valid and you put the number together to convince people you be right the kindest thing i could call it be propaganda

 any projectile travel at or near typical bullet speed be potentially lethal even blank which have no projectile can cause death if the muzzle be in close proximity to the victim i have heard of rubber or plastic bullet be use effectively during riot situation where the intent be crowd control rather than close range self defense also see report of death cause by them the british in northern ireland use of a firearm for self defense be appropriate and lawful only in the gravest of situation at that point i consider deadly lethal force to be a proper reaction and so do the law furthermore use of less effective but still potentially lethal force have it own set of problem it may well take more application of the less effective force to stop the incident this place all party at some risk the victim because the attack have not stop and the assailent since the aggregate damage do by the multiple application may well be more deadly
 just to shed some light on the fire it be widely report ap etc that there be several witness to bd folk start the fire it have also be report that the fire broke out in several place at once which rule out a bradley knock over a lamp etc a the cause what i would like to see be some serious discussion of this incident i believe the move make be right and proper but i still have some problem with some of the tactic after watch the abc special on it tonight a well a cnn and nightline i question some of the atf and fbi action 1 could it have be possible to have take koresh outside the compound at some time before the feb  28th raid 2 could a far wait have result in a different outcome 3 be fbi action blaring loudspeaker etc the    right    course of action and a few other question like i say i believe the action take in general be proper but i still have some reservation

 well i drop by the library yesterday and picked up back copy of the national crime survey 1986 1990 in an effort to examine what it say about self defense with a firearm i ground through much in the way of number yet but a couple of thing jumped out at me first only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon use in self defense 1988 1989 and 1990 refer only to    weapon    the second be that while assault rise about 3 from 1986 to 1987 w gun defense report  fell  by almost 25 unless there  s an explanation for this tempt to mark it a a reporting problem and a such go ahead with any examination of the number would be a waste of time anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference and not just a reporting difference the survey appear to have change significantly between 1986 and 1987

 so like what do you do during those six month to be    active    my town have a similar requirement and rather stupid before you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun club well how active can you be without a gun chief most gun owner feel a check of criminal record for crime and mental disorder would be a very good thing    if it be abuse by the government but every time this be propose there be always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase even if you be perfectly qualify to own a gun and we oppose this since the fatal accident rate for license automobile driver in the u be around 50 time the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owner think twice before use this analogy besides the problem be criminal use of gun not accident there be about 500 000 criminal us of gun in the u every year    but only 1 400 accident i think necessary to spend a lot of energy make sure a criminal can shoot a gun before he get one just like the check most gun owner feel positively about require safety course    if they be abuse by the government but they already have one state hold the course another fund them a third hold them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connection be this fair and how many of them acquire these gun from legal retail outlet how many be borrow steal smuggle bought on the black market some state allow only open carry some allow only conceal carry some allow both some allow both but require license for conceal carry all you can say be if one of these mode have a clear advantage over another in term of reduce crime or any other public good then state legislator someplace be do exactly the wrong thing which mean that they really have any objective reason for these law other than their preference    a bad way to govern    hot livered    i love that expression here we say    hot headed    typically the only criminal who can affect the right of all the other people be criminal in government office the rest of our criminal affect the right of only one or a few people at a time and they do this during the commission of a crime possession of a gun by someone hurt no one else it be when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs of course it be a crime for a felon or ex felon to posse a gun but we feel it be right to treat common citizen who have live good life a if they be just    pre felons    wait to commit crime i understand this sentence life fair i need a fire extinguisher either or flood and theft insurance or to lock the door of my house and car but pin for a well world do anything to address what i have to do to live in this one none of ours sure frankly not sure i know what good a driver  s license do anyone either the people who drive safely never use it and the people who drive drunk drive without it however a car be a good tool but not one that protects my right to life i rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely the question be not whether or not you want to own gun personally whether or not you think that all people should be force to do a you do i have any problem with someone who say they would never own a gun i do have a problem with someone who say i should be prevent from own one too
 this mention of a well regulate militia be what confuses me accord to the federalist paper  s a well regulate militia have a well define structure and follow nationally uniform regulation perhaps you should actually read the federalist paper perhaps you should reread federal 29 which deal exclusively with the    well regulate malitia    here be what be say about it character to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other class of the citizen to be under arm for the purpose of go through military exercise and evolution a often a might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well regulated militia it also talk about the    well regulate militia    have a nationally uniform in structure and disipline i will note you do quote the end of this particular paragraph which state little more can reasonably be aim at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly arm and equip and in order to see that this be not neglect it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year but do you knew how much organization be require to training a large group of poeple twice a year just to try to get the same people every year provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrate into the force and find a suitable location it require a continually stand committee of organizer since a well regulate militia be nationally uniform in structure and disipline and meet once or twice a year to train how can you claim a    well regulate militia    be not well organize but i will concide a    well organize militia    be not necessarily a    well regulate militia    several people have state that the    well organize militia    be what be define under 10 usc 311 which state the militia of the united state consists of all able bodied male at least 17 year of age and except a provide in section 313 of title 32 under 45 year of age who be or who have make a declaration of intention to become citizen of the united state and of female citizents of the united state who be commission officer of the national guard this deos define the militia but be be the adjective    well regulate    10 usc 311 do not define a    well regualed militia    in any way shape or form it only defines who can become part of a well regulate militia the federalist paper clearly define the    well regualed militia    a a proper subset of the militia in the same paragraph quote above it talk above    discipline all the militia of the united state    so they fit the    character of a well regulated militia    this be what the paragraph state about the associate cost it would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country to an amount which calculate upon the present number of the people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishment of all the state to attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent would be unwise and the experiment if make could not succeed because it would not long be endure another quote provide by charles scripter be james madison federalist paper 41 regard the    general welfare    clause    nothing be more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particular    so the phrase    the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe    must either qualify or explain the phrase    a well regulate militia be necessary to the security of a free state    the definition of    explain    a state in    the american hertitage dictionary of the enlish language    the new college edition 1982 be 1 to make plain or comprehensible remove obscruity from elucidate    it be the economist who undertook to explain this puzzle    2 to define explicate expound he explain his plan 3 to offer reason for or a cause of an answer for justify explain an error the second phrase clearly do not    explain    the first therefore the second phrase must    qualify    the first the definition give for    qualify    be 1 to describe by enumerate the characteristic or quality of characterize 2 to make competent or suitable for office position or task 3 to give legal power to make legally capable 4 to modify limit or restrict a give exception 5 to make less harsh or severe moderate 6 grammar to modify the meaning of a word or phrase since    the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe    do not describe modify or make less harsh anything and it have nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task by process of elimination it must fall into definition 3  and since 3 deal with legal power the same thing the constitution do it must be the correct definition in this case therefore    the right of the people to keep and bear arm    give legal power to the    well regualated militia    and this legal power    shall not be infringe    i thank you very much mr scripter you have provide me with more evidence that the second amendment only concern itseft with the people  s right to form well regulate militia and say very little about the right of an untrained person to    keep and bear    a  50 caliber machine gun and since i totally untrained in the use of any firearm something i personly have meant to correct by go to a nra gun safety course and join a gun club can not legally buy such a machine gun i conclude the court and democraticly elect congress agree with me so now we know which category mr  rutledge be in he mean to destroy our liberty and right i mean    to destory our liberty and right    be that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what    our libertues and right    be i force my version of    our liberty and right    by begining statement of what    our liberty and right    with    all that the second amendment clearly state to me    use expression such a    state to me    clearly mean i intend to force my view on others i think so so in effort not to force my view and not    to destory our liberty and right    i state that nothing i have write or will write in the matter of    liberty and right    be the final word for i be only one person among many and the final word on    liberty and right    cleary and irrevocably belongs to the many

 rather people kill people with gun the sad truth be sometimes that be good or at least well than the alternative ok  there be about 1400 fatal firearm accident per year 1 and the number have be in decline since early this century 2 most of these accident involve rifle or shot gun not handgun     in fact there be both gun and bullet design specifically for that the idea that my ruger mark ii bull barrel a semi auto 0 22 caliber handgun be design to kill or hurt people even for self defense would sure come a a surprise to it designer it certainly why i have it it certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it and might even kill them but it be simply wrong to say it be design to kill people in fact that be what happens most of the time most self defensive us of firearm involve fire any shot most criminal would prefer not to be shot and will go to some effort not to be include do what you say when you point a gun at them if you be call on to design a tool that could be easily carry to immediately stop someone attack you what would it be a handgun be about the best anyone have come up with and experience show it do work the best 3 certainly no one argues that handgun of the type we be discuss deadly weapon however it simply true to say that all of them be design to kill people moreover what exactly be wrong with have deadly weapon there be time when it be perfectly legitimate to use deadly force e g in self defense i consider it not just my right but my duty to defend myself and my family and that include have and know how to use the tool to do that    the strong reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arm be a a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government    t  jefferson i think what jefferson say be still true not very often compare to other use 3 this that common either at least when compare to other us it be very rare that a non violent person will suddenly    get pissed    and kill someone gun or not in most case the people who murder have long history of violence if you have good reason to believe that these people kill if they have a gun feel free to present it right but there be time when kill thing be call for i hope i never have to shoot a person but have to kill a number of animal from rodent to cow and when i do i want them to suffer any more than be necessary i prefer they die instantly but fail that i want them to drop so i can quickly finish them with the next shot and fail that i want them to go fast or far i try to choose the best weapon and ammunition i have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal after but it always work a i plan without belaboring the point people who be overly impressed with the kill or shopping power of gun particularly handgun use them much for that purpose 1 accidental death in 1988 48700 death by auto 11300 death by fall 5300 death by drown 4800 death by fire 4400 death by poison 3200 death by food 1400 death by firearm

 i believe this raid be ill plan because they only have 2 day to plan it and it be continued when failure be obvious because it have a bit part in the much large political agenda of president clinton i would even suggest that the loss of 4 atf agent be inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda it might even be beneficial to his agenda a it help point up just how evil these assualt weapon be far proof might be that the atf deny their agent street story report request for sufficient fire power important date feb 25th nj assembly vote to overturn assault weapon ban feb 28th compound in waco attack on feb  25th the new jersey assembly vote to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state it look like it might be a tight vote but the senate in n j  be go to vote to overturn the ban it would not sit well to have an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban give clinton state agenda on gun control i suspect clinton give the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapon and have the press present they be initially at the incident in waco to record the event for the tv audience the agent on    street story    report that a supervisor be urge them all to    get ready fast    a    they know we be come    i believe this attack continued even tho the probablility of failure be high because it come from the top down after the n j  assembly vote the atf have a limited amount of time to come up with something and the wacko in waco fit the bill nicely     rich i know rich last year when the congress be debate the bushman  crime bill the incident at lubys cafe occur most of the anti gun crap be amend out of the bill anyway could a president  order go find some  assault weapon and bring the medium    i hope not frankly the toon meister  scare me of course have a democratic majority in congress help apology to all demo who support rkba  definition toon meister a characatureic name for the current president of the u s  clinton aka clintoon aka toon meister
 they do accord the the los angeles police department illegal manufacture be one the three primary source of machine gun and submachine gun use in crime sumggling and theft from the police and military be the other two washington d c  police have state that 40 if remember the figure correctly of the gun they conficate be illegally built it take about 6 hour and a few tool to make one at least one of reasonable quality unless the drug dealer enjoyes mess around on a lathe say a a hobby go to have to pay someone anyway material plus six hour of a machinist s time for something legal would run about 100 the blackmarket price for gun be usually in the 50 to 200 range at least those few see cite in newspaper article be     washington d c  have a total ban on handgun and prohibits assemble rifle within city limit homicide rate be almost ten time the national average it be also illegal for a d c  resident to drive to the virginia or maryland suburb and buy a gun dealer be require by federal law to check id and make sure the buyer from another state so the ban can not be easily side stepped sure but it you buy one you would write your own in fact people _did_ write their own 15 year ago     more likely you would find a friend who be a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his software be a _very_ bad example for your case how many people do you know with illegal copy of 400 word processor if people want something and it available or affordable legally they will usually get it illegally quite 13 3 2  the formula have be around for half a million year or be you go to restrict sale of sulpher charcoal and saltpeter alot cruder than modern smokless powder but it work very well the only real problem be a  25 reduction in energy so a  357 magnum would    only    be a deadly a a 9mm and it make alot more smoke     of course a smart black marketeer could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the police the police be often corruptable and thing be know to disappear from police evidence room and armory and reappear on the street     perhaps you watch the news two year ago but the serb also try to invade slovinia they be driven out after a few week by partisan arm with home made _anti tank_ weapon the afghan rebel frequently make their own rifle
 i have be convince of the right of american to an effective self defense but something strike me a odd among the pro rkba argument present here the number compare hundred of thousand indeed even a million of instance of law abide citizen deter criminal activity seem valid to me likewise the number of gun caused homicide each year about 11 000 year however it be surprising that the    evil antigun empire    darth vader breathing sound effect here never try to compare    all legitimate gun defense    vs     all gun crime    instead always    all legitimate gun defense    which include case in which the criminal be shot but not kill and case in which the criminal be not here vs  just criminal gun homicide which only include case sin which the victim die why be this of course it be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measure involve gun the consequnces be already know and it be safe to assume that a gun based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun basd robbery homicide whereas in the legitimate gun defense one may assume that all those criminal who be deter would have commit more crime or more serious crime have they not be deter  case kim
 be that your argument well you make it very well you start from the questionable premise that the fire be necessarily an act of insanity rather than an act of negligence or an accident recall one survivor claim that the fire start when a tank knock over a kerosene lamp kind of make argument regard relative sanity somewhat moot no    nice evasive maneuver mr  chekov but still on our tail    let me ask it more plainly which of the above complaint about david koresh  s religious or sexual proclivity justified an arm raid by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearm not entirely far fetched nobody outside the compound would know everybody inside the compound forget the batf admits have agent inside the compound in any case simply be the devil  s advocate there  s reasonable doubt by the boatload stand in the way of anybody totally swallow the official government story on waco
 there be several way in which one can choose to intrepret any constitutational issue a original intent b subjectively intrepreted accordiong to political whim of the day if we use original intent a the basis for intrepreting the constitution it be clear that the found father intend that the individual citizen be allow to bear arm similar to those use by soldier of the day for reference i cite federalist paper    the embarassing second ammendment    yale law review prof  stanford levinson sorry i have the date handy prof levinson sought to prove that the 2nd ammendment do not convey an individual right but conclude that it do hence the    embarassing    in his title report of the subcomittee on the consititution united state sendate 97th congress second session february 1982 u s  vs  verguido urguidez supreme court case in recent year although this case do not pertain to firearm justice rhenquist note that the term    the people    be a term of art convey individual right and specifically cite several use 2nd ammentment include in his opinion title 10 u s  code this state that all male between the age of 18 45 not part of the organize militia and all female officer of the national guard be part of the unorganized militia
 and i might add vitamin c have be endorse by a nobel laureate a a panacea for almost everything from the common cold to cancer wait a minute s k do not compare trend if they do they would have see that the advent of canada  s gun law have no effect on homicide total or handgun without a pre  vs  post comparison one can not speculate a to the utility of anything all they have be a correlation and correlation do not prove causality hold it again you dismiss a point about demographic then you ask about socio economic demographic very slick once again correlation do not prove causality look at pre vs  post data the canadian gun law have no effect sir if you be a canadian and own a gun before the restrictive gun law be pass and decide to hide it rather than turn it in would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who call writes or asks you on the street that be one problem with survey nobody will answer an incriminate question another be that people will often tell you what they think you want to here do that mean no vancouver citizen have handgun i think not you be discounting gun purchase beforehand and gun purchase for purpose other than self defense which can also be use for defense he make valid point about demographic difference you then resort to the kind of argument that the    politically correct    movement often us to stifle any debate nice real nice one have to produce his own data in order to point out the flaw in the methodology and conclusion of another  s study again you resort to pc tactic
 hmm     be i the only person that remembers masada this the first time a group have commit suicide to avoid persecution capture     and you seem to miss the point that the raid should never have happen in the first place i find the fbi action too damn reminiscent of the warsaw ghetto     fitting that al gore be in poland for event mark the 50th anniversery of that     remove any reference to date and you have two raid by government troop wear black uniform carry automatic weapon back by armored vehicle against religious minority they claim be practice sexually deviant behavior and hoard weapon     too damn similar     james p i be not advocate the bd  s i just find the whole situation too damn trouble
 even if it be a capital offense the warrant be not even an arrest warrant but a search warrant in other word there be no evidence of illegal arm just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to search for illegal evidence

 jason kratz write     jk if they have rocket launcher and such a the press and gov claim why jk they have do something what possible use would a religious cult jk have for a rocket launcher also be child abuse cover by the bill of jk right     this be take a little out of context and not flame jason     just that this be the proverbial straw     i grow a little weary of the allegation here the medium people on the street that the bd  s have all these    horrible illegal weapon and other paraphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tank 50 foot into the air        and then without miss a beat discus how the bd  s willfully commit mass suicide or kill their own less fanatical and  then  commit mass suicide etc  etc if the bd  s have all these thing and intend to    blow up their abode blow up waco blow up the entire country or whatever suit your fancy what happen to all the violence they be suppose to unleash why they have    go out in the proverbial blaze of glory    and    come out shoot    with an attitude of    let  s take a many of those dog a possible with u    instead they seem to have prefer death to whatever they thought be in store for them at the government  s hand totally immaterial whether they be all crazy all fanatic all follower of the antichrist hater of the government practicers of weird lifestyle or whatever     they must have felt that they be be pressure into renounce their belief however how strange or lunatic those belief might appear to    you and me    there be much precedent for such devotion to cause my conclusion at this point be that the    authority    seriously misread their danger to society else why do the bd  s not do a suggest above and or chose this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda up to and include ag j  renbo use this a an opportunity to assert her manhood some people really do believe it be well to die than be subject to what they perceive a the godless government when i force myself to not judge others by my own personal standard and belief i can almost admire their stand i surely believe in the constitution but i know that i have such strength of conviction a evidence by the bd  s    olx 2 2 obesa non cantatis

 what happen in waco be not the fault of the batf if they would of have the proper equipment and personal then they could of capture the with the wod and the increase crime in the street the batf be need more now then ever if they blast away a few good fokes then that be with the arm build up in waco they need to hit that compound with mega fire power they could of go in there blasting and kill a few i hope this be a joke     if not here  s my response the batf have a history of no knock raid with poor evidence often result in innocent people be kill or suffer injury to person or property i will not support the batf until they clean up their act     maybe     a to equipment the batf have damn near anything it want     their fault be in intelligence military and civilian definition apply tactic attack during daylight methodology the fbi state that it be against government policy to assault a position where there be non combatants potential hostage without attempt negotiation first and legality the batf  s jurisdiction be tax on firearm and tobacco they be a branch of the department of the treasury they have very curiously back away from their claim of illegal weaponry to push the child abuse charge     the batf have no jurisdiction over non firearms tobacco issue and the charge of child abuse have be investigate in the past with no violence and no validation this be a clear case of first the batf then the fbi have watch too many rambo movie     my opinion be that the agent in charge should be charge with execute an illegal raid criminal negligence murder civil right violation and break his her oath to uphold and defend the constitution of the u the warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the public what justification the batf thought it have in commit an arm assault on american citizen and while on the issue of investigate this issue the randy weaver case and the johnny lawmaster case should be investigate for batf wrongdoing james btw if the batf come bust in my window with concussion grenade you could damn well bet i would return fire to the utmost of my ability
 the point that i forgot to bring up here and this have nothing to do with be a gang member or not be that it be illegal to carry a conceal weapon in this area or in the state of illinois for that matter this be not to say that people in illinois carry conceal weapon illegaly but practice like that when there be other people around too bright of an idea i agree if you practice at all and carry a gun for self defense you most likely would be in big trouble if a situation be to arise

 be the license require for drive a car exclusively on private property such a a farm here in the united state the license be require only for the use of public road we also have a nation of 250 million people _many_ issue and usually only two candidate for a give office a president might be willing to abuse mild gun control law and create a de facto ban something a majority of the people would object to and still be elect the voter might look at issue like the civil right of minority health care etc     and vote for the    lesser of two evil    i think this be a matter of paranoia since local government in for example new york and chicago have abuse exist mild gun control law to create a virtual ban in which case the united state already have adaquate gun control law accord to federal statistic only 7 of gun wielding criminal legally purchase their own gun from license dealer if the point of gun control to prevent criminal from legally purchasing gun then america need any additional law to accomplish this how be this any different from gun there be legal purpose for own and use a gun they be appropriate tool for hunt target shoot and self defence like car murder their only or even a common use i certainly imagine the american public accept regulation of ax while the politics of other nation may be different in america there be strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average law abiding citizen who have not do anything wrong a good way to deal with which problem it be an excelent way to deal with the short term problem of rioting and violent attack of course it do anything for the long term issue that start riot but at this point what can these individual do about long term social problem there be accord to survey gun in 40 of american home in many part of the country this be closer to 100 those place where almost everyone own a gun be on average safer than those where gun be less common this be i think a fundamental difference between american government and that of other nation here it be not acceptable to punish or restrict the average law abiding citizen in the name of some vague    common good

 if alcohol be again ban today it would be much more difficult to manage a large scale smuggle operation the cop now rank just a narrow notch below the military in communication intelligence gathering and firepower in a similar vein the amount of marijuana smuggle into this country have greatly decrease this be because it value per pound be very low when compare to cocaine or heroin simply not worth the risk uneconomical now most reefer be domestic there be less pressure on the domestic producer showy raid notwithstanding and thus it be economical of note though     domestic reefer be now very strong so a small volume go a long way you can not make alcohol strong than 200 proof not a good dollar pound deal

 from    preston k  covey    covey  andrew cmu edu subject gun stats mortal risk date mon 15 feb 1993 18 35 05  0500 est folk hail from the nether world on february 4th the wall street journal carry a front page article by erik larson entitle    arm force    i felt a reply be in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that    a gun be 43 time more likely to kill than to protect    i sent the follow to the wsj       gun stats mortal risk preston k  covey erik larson s even handed article on paxton quigley  armed force 2 4 93 wsj cite the world s most notorious  statistic  regard gun in the home  a pioneer study of residential gunshot death in king county washington found that a gun in the home be 43 time more likely to be use to kill it owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder   the  43 times  stat be everywhere these day it have grown in medium lore like the proverbial urban myth it be inflate by one pugilistic talk show pundit to  93   give the shock value of the find the conclusion of the 1986 new england journal of medicine nejm study be remarkably understated  the advisability of keep firearm in the home for protection must be questioned   responsible people should indeed question the risk and benefit of bring a firearm into their home but what we need to know be this what exactly be the risk and benefit the nejm testimony be neither the whole truth about the benefit nor nothing but the truth about the risk far a with motor vehicle we want to know what control do we have over the risk and benefit and a with the risk of cancer or heart disease or auto accident how can we minimize the risk like raw highway death toll the nejm stat be not very helpful here the nejm find purport to inform u but it be frame to warn u off it be widely promulgate in the medium a a  scare stat a mislead half truth whose very formulation be calculate to prejudice and terrify the frightful statistic scream for itself the risk far outweigh the benefit yes what fool would run these risk if your car be 43 time more likely to kill you a love one a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination should you not take the bus uncritical citation put the good name of statistic in the bad company of lie and damn lie surely we can do well where life be at stake let s take a closer look at this risky business the  43 times  stat of the nejm study be the product of divide the number of home intruders aggressors justifiably kill in self defense the divisor into the number of family member or acquaintance kill by a gun in the home the dividend the divisor of this risk equation be 9 in the study s five year sample there be 2 intruder and 7 other case of self defense the dividend be 387 in the study there be 12 accidental death 42 criminal homicide and 333 suicide 387 divide by 9 yield 43  there be a total of 743 gun related death in king county between 1978 and 1983 so the study leaf 347 death outside of home unaccounted the nejm s notorious  43 times  statistic be seriously mislead on six count 1  the dividend be misleadingly characterize in the medium the  or acquaintances  of the study who include your friendly drug dealer and neighborhood gang member be equate to  friends   the implication be that the offend gun target and kill only beloved family member dear friend and innocent child death may all be equally tragic but the character and circumstance of both victim and killer be relevant to the risk these crucial risk factor be masked by the calculate impression that the death toll be generate by witless walton shoot dear friend and friendly neighbor this be criminological hogwash 2  the study itself do not distinguish household or environs populate by people with violent criminal or substance abuse history    where the risk of death be very high    versus household inhabit by more civil folk for example people who avoid high risk activity like drug deal gang banging and wife beating    where the risk be very low indeed in actuality negligent adult allow fatal but avoidable accident and homicide be perpetrate mostly by people with history of violence or abuse people who be identifiably and certifiably at  high risk  for misadventure to ignore these obvious risk factor in firearm accident and homicide be a mislead a ignore the role of alcohol in vehicular death by tautology neither gun death nor vehicular death would occur without firearm or vehicle but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk 3  one mislead implication of the way the nejm stat be frame be that the mere presence of a gun in the home be much more likely to kill than to protect and this obscures    indeed disregard    the role of personal responsibility the typical quotation of this study unlike larson s attribute fatal agency to the gun  a gun in the home be 43 time a likely to kill    the center to prevent handgun violence a major promulgator of the nejm statistic us this particular formulation we can dispense with the silly debate about whether it s people or gun that accomplish the kill again by tautology gun death would not occur without the gun the question beg be how many death would occur anyway without the gun in any case people be the death dealing agent the gun be their lethal instrument the moral core of the personal risk factor in gun death be personal responsibility and choice due care and responsibility obviate gun accident human choice mediates homicide and suicide by gun or otherwise the choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to nejm s high risk pool the gun do not create this risk by itself people have a lot to say about what risk they run with gun in their home for example graduate of paxton quigley s personal protection course do not run the tout  43 times  risk any more than skilled and sober driver run the same risk of cause or suffer vehicular death a do reckless or drunk driver undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice just a they disregard and obscure the role of socio economic criminological and other risk relevant factor in firearm related death this be why we resent insurance premium and actuarial consigment to risk pool whose norm disregard our individuality fortunately nothing can consign u to the nejm risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter 4  suicide account for 84 of the death by gun in the home in the nejm study a against the total death by gun in king county include those outside the home in house suicide be 44 of the total death toll which be closer to the roughly 50 proportion found by other study suicide be a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accident the implication of the nejm study be that these suicide might not occur without readily available gun it be true that attempt suicide by gun be likely to succeed it be not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicide this be widely assume or allege but the preponderance of research on gun and suicide actually show otherwise that this be wishful think in all but a few truly impulsive case see bruce l  danto et al  the human side of homicide columbia university press 1982 charles rich et al   guns and suicide american journal of psychiatry march 1990 if suicide be remove from the dividend of the nejm study s risk equation the  43 times  stat would deflate to  six   the inclusion of suicide in the nejm risk equation    like the cause durability or interdiction of suicidal intent itself    be a profoundly debatable matter quotation of the nejm study totally disregard this issue 5  citation of the nejm study also mislead regard the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide most measure like the nejm homicide rate be base on the immediate disposition of case but many homicide initially rule criminal be appeal and later rule self defense in the literature on batter woman immediate case disposition be notorious for under representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide time s january 18 1993 cover story on woman  fighting back  report one study s find that 40 of woman who appeal have their murder conviction thrown out time s july 17 1989 cover story on a week of gun death report 51 of the domestic case a shooting by abuse victim but only 3 of the homicide be report a self defense in a may 14 1990 update time report that 12 of the homicide have eventually be rule self defense in time s sample the originally report rate of self defense be in error by a factor of four the possibility of such error be not acknowledge by promulgator of the nejm statistic 6  while both the dividend and the product of the nejm risk equation be arguably inflate the divisor be unconscionably mislead the divisor of this equation count only aggressor who be kill not aggressor who be successfully thwart without be kill or even shot at the utility of arm self defense be the other side of the coin from the harm do with gun in home what kind of moral idiocy be it to measure this utility only in term of killing do we measure the utility of our police solely in term of felon kill    a oppose to the many many more who be otherwise foil apprehend or deter should we not celebrate let alone count those case where no human life be lose a successful arm defense the question pose to medium that cite the nejm scare stat be this why neglect the compendious research on successful arm defense notably by criminologist gary kleck point blank gun and violence in america aldine de gruyter 1992 kleck s estimation of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use be base on victimization survey a well a other study the rate be high about one million a year and the risk be good gun defender fare well than anyone either those who resort to other form of resistance or those who do not resist divide one million gun defense a year by 30 000 annual gun death from self defense homicide suicide and accident yield 33  thus we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the nejm scare stat a gun be 33 time more likely to be use to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody of course kleck s critic belittle the dividend of this calculation what be good news for gun defender be bad news for gun control we should indeed question the basis and method of kleck s high estimation of defensive firearm use a i have question the nejm statistic clearly the issue of how to manage mortal risk be not settle by uncritical citation of statistic one thing trouble me still we can hardly escape the unquestioned nejm scare stat in our medium but we hardly ever find kleck s good work mention even critically
 there be but not any that would help texan in many state such law have be found to violate the state constitution but the federal second amendment do not apply directly to the state it be write to limit the federal government only the fourteenth amendment be write to extend the restriction of the bill of right to the state level however the exact word of the fourteenth amendment be very vague the supreme court have be dance around the issue without face it directly for over 100 year in practice the bill of right indirectly applies through the fourteenth applies to the state government only if the supreme court have rule that particular provision the court have make no such ruling on the second amendment

 how so i think make assumption here that might not necessarily be true  my  personal choice would be a semi auto but revolver be just a effective if not more so relevancy please you sound shock but that hardly prof anything wait chicago have  serious  gun control if so why do the police need all that firepower in the first place sarcasm alert all the patrol car see around here have shotgun clamped to the dash board imho all the police need to outgun just about anything jason

                                            the    use to kill    be the heart of the misinformation one of those technically accurate phrasing that conveys the wrong impression what mr  quiqley be more than aware of sure be that when people read this they think violent argument where one member of the family grab a gun and shoot another thereby create a tragic situation which could easily have be avoid have the gun not be there or a tragic accident especially involve a child unfortunately not the way thing stack up the majority of that 43    time    37 i believe be suicide that be someone intentionally take a firearm and shot themselves intend to kill themselves and why popular to try and blame suicide on gun the evidence support this internal study a well a comparative study with other country indicate that cultural factor far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not japan for instance have a slightly high rate than the u s  there people jump off building accord to the national crime survey 40 of violent crime be commit by    non strangers    which mistakenly have be generalize regard the king county study to mean    friend and family    that be mr  quigley and others who quote this statistic be banking on the mental image that a    friend family member or child    equates to a love relationship and that it be cut short in a moment of anger unfortunately all too often husband beat and kill wife child assault parent or vice versa most rape be commit by someone know to the victim for instance essentially that a gun be use against a    friend    or family member mean they try to hurt the other person crime be high among poor urban family and those be also the area most    at risk    for family problem especially violent one a son in a gang may not be a love toward his parent if they disapprove than a suburban kid might finally it hinge on the fallacy that a dead intruder be the only value of a self defense firearm use the minimum figure i work out use the nc i get about an 80 1 ratio between deadly self defense justifiable homicide and with gun self defense between the fbi uniform crime report and the nc there  s an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the number a such it be incorrect to assume that a dead body be the only valid mean of determine the success of such a defense since accord to the nc which have be consider by many to seriously under report defense there be far more successful with gun defense than intruder kill not it also confines itself to the home where attack by a    friend or family member    be far far more likely and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home i believe a large number occur in business i have not see the exact data for this so i comment i will point out canada  s and japan  s suicide rate a indication that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rate there be also a comparative study between canada for what worth consider the difficulty of compare across cultural line publish in the new england journal of medicine i can get the exact cite if you need it that conclude that restrictive firearm law would not significantly impact the over all suicide rate

 i write nice strawman indeed the discussion be not about whether there be tank use in sixty riot instead it be about whether those tank fire their main gun in one of those riot you claim they do that claim be ludicrous awesley reply i repeat what i have be told under what context i have heard it support the claim that tank be indeed use in detroit in 67  the issue have never be whether tank be use in detroit in 1967  it have be whether they fire their main gun you do not merely claim that tank be use    you claimed that they fire their main gun to suppress sniper fire and that they be    quite    effective at this you continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody be dispute awesley go on i spent a few minute in a library today    found their computer be down and they have a card catalog anyway it take about 10 minute to find this in _nightmare in detroit a rebellion and victims_ by sauter and hines on page 133 tell of the death of tonia blanding age 4    when the tank be fire upon by sniper it turn in the direction the shot come from     the fifty caliber machine gun mount on the tank belch fire into the building after a short round into the front of the building the tank gun spit again tear apart huge hole out of the side of the apartment    well not the main gun    well not the main gun    gee only the entire point be you now go to admit that you be wrong will i see any picture of tank fire their main gun will i see picture of building damage by the shell will i read the report of the tank fire i  ll bet you dollar to doughnut i it will take more than second hand account from a few old national guard sergeant shoot the shit to convince me that tank shell american city in the sixty awesley reply well if you bother to read them it take long at all to find report of tank fire    although not necessarily of the main gun i will never read of tank fire their main gun in detroit in the  67 riot there be simply no way that such an event could have take place without it be common knowledge even 26 year later the american military fire shell from tank in american city on black would have be  big  news awesley go on you can also read of the troop use grenade launcher to fire fragmentary grenade i doubt that a well to fire concussion grenade perhaps to fire tear gas certainly but you would be perfectly willing to let u believe they fire frags you since it make your other claim seem more plausible and on i expect to convince you have to open your mind and eye and actually do a little research to be convince one way or the other let me know what you find i already know what you found nothing if i claimed that the marine use f 4s to launch rocket at building in trenton new jersey would you believe me would you suspend judgment until you have a chance to research it or would your bullshit filter kick in if tank have fire their main gun in detroit people would have be scream about it for the past two and half decade i would know about it unless you also claim that the national guard manage to cover it up if your mind be open enough to believe that well good for you i prefer to live in reality and here in reality i find it hard to believe that those tank even have any shell much less fire them

 for me it would be an obvious choice arm self defence be clearly and strongly protect by the colorado constitution and the law of the state in the very clear cut situation of your hypothetical i have anything to fear from the police unless i have be publicly carry the weapon conceal something not in the habit of do     even then the bad have to deal with be a class 2 misdemeanor even if the situation be not so clear and i might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or homicide it would still be safer to wait for the police if i be to leave and try to avoid police involvement be commit several felony and ruin my chance of claim self defence in court    if it really be self defence    the prosecuter would ask    why do you run away and hide from the police    in other state however this decision might not be so clear cut if someone in say washington d c  be to use a gun in self defence he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violation of that city  s gun control law such a person  s choice would be between certain conviction for a couple of felony versus possible conviction for half a dozen

 hi in canada any gun that enters a national park must be seal i think a small metal tag place over the trigger the net result of this be that you __ use a gun to protect yourself from bear or psycho in the national park instead one have to be sensitive to the danger and annoyance of hike in bear country and take the appropriate precaution i think this policy make the user of the national park feel a little closer to nature that they be a part of nature and a such have to deal with nature on own term
 the swiss population be and well be far large than that i think your question should be        lose sleep over a million expert rifleman    certainly he could have conquer switzerland but a million arm militiaman especially in a mountainous area where tank effectiveness be limited would have make it a real pain the question a conqueror would ask be    be it worth the trouble    the more difficult an invasion be the more likely the answer would be    no    certainly a million rifleman a oppose to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand the best a country the size of switzerland could support make invasion more difficult hitler invade yugoslavia and occupy it the mountainous portion be sometimes patrol by the wermacht but they be certainly not in control there be two major native faction oppose each other and the german it be basically useless to the german no production and a drain on their resource a armored division and a couple of infantry division which if my memory be correct be kind of stuck there up until the ally accepted their surrender i think that the ally also let the german keep some of their weapon for self defense unitil they be able to get to the lowland away from the resistance faction this be from memory and it be unreliable

 but whatever the neutron hit have a good chance of absorb the neutron and become radioactive itself mostly that mean water turn into harmless heavy water but some neutron would also hit bone and the result harmfull secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decade i think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be consider a public health hazard a for a shield warhead i think a fair amount of maintaince be require for it to remain safely shield e g storage in a dry temperature regulated facility etc     for private ownership to be unregulated i think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon but keep it in a safe condition if any random private citizen could not properly keep maintain and store a nuclear weapon then some regulation be clearly appropriate i disagree with this purpose the job of the militia be to defend themselves and their community if you look at the american revolution a an example the militia won by seperating themselves from and become independent of a repressive government they overthrow it and those community canada and england for example that defend themselves be still under that same old regime if the role of the militia be offensive to go out and destroy repressive government nuclear weapon _might_ be appropriate but their job be defensive and nuclear weapon suit for that there be also the question of personal and collective arm the second amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapon since the very nature of the militia require member to provide their own arm but it clear if it cover other arm certainly not all member would supply for example a tank only a few could or if they be to be use effectively should however those provide the heavy weapon have a disproportionate control over the militia and it fierpower the militia a the framer envision them be extremely democratic if only 50 of the member support the cause only 50 would respond to a muster and the militia  s firepower would be proportionately reduce militia firepower and the popular will be therefore link but if a small minority of the member supply a large fraction of the firepower in the form of heavy weapon this would all change the militia s firepower would depend on the will of a small minority not of the general public bad that minority would be quite different from the general public at the very least they would be much richer a a result i think the nature and character of the militia require that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia  s firepower his personal weapon and some equitable fraction of a squad  s heavier firepower
 well let me see uzi no m 11 9 no m 16 ar 15 maybe i remember there be a selector swtich on the ar 15 if i remember correctly please correct me if wrong the switch would set to an    off    position or an    on    position because the gun ar 15 be semi automatic the m 16 have a position for semi auto fire and full auto fire or maybe 3 round burst if this be correct it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone of course if the ar 15 be modify to full auto fire i think it would be that easy but talk about distinguish between an unmodified ar 15 and m 16 how about the other gun do they also have selector switch to switch between semi auto and fully auto fire actually it be pretty hard for the kid in my neighborhood to figure that out a richard petty live in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the driveway well what about what i say above if that be correct i guess tv would be acceptable if you have a good enough picture and a picture of the low receiver of the ar 15 m 16

 the atf agent interviewed on    street story    report that the raid be ill plan and go ahead even when they the bd  s knew the atf be come why i believe this raid be ill plan because they only have 2 day to plan it and it be continued when failure be obvious because it have a bit part in the much large political agenda of president clinton i would even suggest that the loss of 4 atf agent be inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda it might even be beneficial to his agenda a it help point up just how evil these assualt weapon be far proof might be that the atf deny their agent street story report request for sufficient fire power important date feb 25th nj assembly vote to overturn assault weapon ban feb 28th compound in waco attack on feb  25th the new jersey assembly vote to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state it look like it might be a tight vote but the senate in n j  be go to vote to overturn the ban it would not sit well to have an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban give clinton state agenda on gun control i suspect clinton give the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapon and have the press present they be initially at the incident in waco to record the event for the tv audience the agent on    street story    report that a supervisor be urge them all to    get ready fast    a    they know we be come    i believe this attack continued even tho the probablility of failure be high because it come from the top down after the n j  assembly vote the atf have a limited amount of time to come up with something and the wacko in waco fit the bill nicely

 unworthy of comment nor would they have die if they have come out with their hand empty that be undeniable truth my heart bleeds just a much a yours for the child who be never release give 51 day of ample opportunity to do so my heart also bleeds for people so blind by religious devotion to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tank come up and start drop in tear gas early in the morning i do not think this however if they do set the fire which start in more than one place and spread very quickly then they get what they want and put into motion themselves i see the batf be go to be investigate by the justice dept and likely by arlen spectre and congress this be good they have bungle the affair from the start
 however forget that the police in chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the glock which be not approve for carry guess they figure all cop be like the police chief of winnetka who happen to let off a stray round of 9mm this be the same anti gun police chief that want full auto uzi for his patrol car     perhaps in the judgement of the majority of chicago  s fine a close to  100 reliable weapon like a revolver be preferable to a 99 99 reliable automatic i note that in germany where certainly the 9mm semi auto handgun be king some of the more elite police type want revolver i think the issue be cost because chicago police certainly make on the order of at least 40k year your presumption of    disadvantage    i think be not borne out by the experience of new york city  s cop there the cop usually come out on top with their standard  38 spl revolver see s w rugers and beretta 9mms in addition to the revolver carry by chicago cop     in the past see  45 m1911s others have see browning hi powers

 the swiss population be and well be far large than that i think your question should be        lose sleep over a million expert rifleman    certainly he could have conquer switzerland but a million arm militiaman especially in a mountainous area where tank effectiveness be limited would have make it a real pain the question a conqueror would ask be    be it worth the trouble    the more difficult an invasion be the more likely the answer would be    no    certainly a million rifleman a oppose to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand the best a country the size of switzerland could support make invasion more difficult really in 1939 not even sure you could prove that today despite the steriotype certainly the swiss banker be not essential to the german war time economy

 iftccu talk politics guns vincent cad gatech edu vincent fox 10 34 be apr 14 1993 this rec guns so maybe this be get a bet technical but i resist     sometimes        depends on why it misfire     i imagine do much combat type shoot single action        assume the cylinder will rotate     never hurt to err on the side of safety but if get one of those  new fangled hammer block or transfer bar safety unnecessarily redundant rather have the extra round quite true speed loader be a little less convenient to pack around than magazine though true but this be a training function cocked and lock for single action or hammer down on double action be the only carry mode that make sense     the 80 series colt  s for example be quite safe to carry this way agree now that shot off my mouth a bit let me back some of this up it be true that a simple misfire on a revolver cost you much on the other hand have all sort of interest thing happen over the year for example have factory ammunition that have have high primer a high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from second to minute while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem an auto jack the slide and continue have bullet come out of the case keep the cylinder from turn see clearing paragraph above about the bad that can happen with a semi auto be a double feed this can be clear in second most revolver be more  fragile then semi auto  s there be all sort of close tolerance part and fitting involve drop the gun or a blow to the gun or all sort of thing can take it out of action many of the problem that can be cure on the spot with a quality semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver in short a revolver may be less likely to malfunction but a a rule when it do out of the fight the majority of malfunction that occur with semi auto do not fall into that category vincint make many good point in this post but leaf off the oppose view of most of them a real good start place be ayoob  s    the semi auto pistol for police and self defense    in general agree the revolver be an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that do not have the time and inclination that be necessary for the training and practice need to use a semi auto effectively a a self defense arm most cop be notoriously indifferent to firearm if the department go to train them they go to take the time on their own there be no doubt that training be an issue the amount of training require for effective use of a semi auto be probably several time that of a revolver many cop bother for myself hate to be limited to one or the other rather pick what fit well with my personal inclination what wear that day and so on like the moderator on rec guns say buy em all that say i have to admit that often my advice to people think of buying their first defense arm be right after take a class get a ruger or smith revolver     sorry colt fan colt revolver be ok too if this post have go the other way be argue for revolver
 so you have the right unless the federal government say you i think i like this very much this would be much well if it say    everyone except those who have be strip of this right by due process of law    or some such thing also i care for the federal government step on state right regardless of which state right be be step on if the constitution give the fed some power then they have to just shut up about it the only way the fed should have anything to say be if the constitution prohibits locality from infringe on the rkba in which case this bill should just reiterate that the rkba be guaranteed by the constitution and that the fed will take appropriate action if it be infringe

 why you call the city and ask oak park also have an illegal handgun ban a well but do allow those with a    collector ffl    to posse    collectible    handgun probably a fine in practical term it impede your defense at all there be an actual incident in oak park where a gas station owner engage in a shootout with a handgun the grand jury decide not to presecute on the other hand a black man use an illegally own handgun in oak park to defend himself and the village try to make an example out of him an nra director who live there make a stink about this and it be decide not to charge the guy of course piss off anti gun police thug have own drawback like when the oak park police chief come to his house and told him    this be step over the line this could get dangerous for you    whereupon the few black oak park police officer watch over his house to ensure that the white anti gun police chief and his anti gun crony f ck with him his home or family l v cipriani state that the    any other weapon    category be allow but the exact relationship between an ithaca auto burgular which i believe be in the    any other weapon    category and a chopped barrel h k hk 94 class 3 for sure be not clear to me     in your dream buddy a long a democrat reign in chicago illinois resident will always be disarm and helpless in the street politician get around this by provision in the law that allow them to carry conceal weapon voter in chicago be too stupid to vote these a  holes out of office because the dems be always in power the illinois supreme court be always tilt to the democratic party  s view on gun all candidate support by political consultant david axelrod be anti gun which explains anti rkba crook county state attorney jack as o malley be a so called    republican

 this mean you would support a ban if it be narrow enough good i would hope so let  s define a nuclear weapon a an explosive weapon whose majority of energy come from fission and or fusion of atomic nucleus let  s define a biological weapon a live organism or virus in such state quantity and with such a vector that they could cause death or serious disease far define to a significant number of people if release in a city similarly populate area resevoir or cropland nerve gas and mustard gas be well define other poisonous gas should be individually ban only if it can be show that there be no use not related to weaponry license should be available for research purpose on such chemical i be not a lawyer but these idea could certainly be a basis for definition nope it be not consider a weapon it be not define a a weapon of mass destruction many thing be ban for other reason
 down to 170 some odd line we must be make progress on an ironic note where i delete line emacs continually give me the message    garbage collect     do    think try to tell me something you lurker can join in at any time you know ahhh   talk politics guns    the kindler gentler newsgroup who would have thought i remind you of shrapnel i consider 5 a reasonable space limitation but make no mistake a gun blowing up be a hazard to those nearby say in the next lane at the range my point be at what distance or level of threat we draw the line be it the endangerment of others so we do a 5 restriction or the possibility of be shot hence we draw a 1 5 mile restriction or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction to me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict base upon the instrument rather than place the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulder of the user perhaps sen  metzenbaum declare the barrett light fifty an assault rifle have make this more apparent to me since the barrett have only range and acurracy go for it i disagree on the ground that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once i have die i assume that word would get to the citizen that such an attack be plan if this be not the case the tactical and strategic implication change quite a bit personally my home be worth say twenty martian intent on take over the world my family all of them the balance act here be hard to judge sit at my desk that seem to be the case already give that heavy weapon commonly own by the citizenry with such low number obviously due to cost i think the superior weapon be go to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe furthermore it be even more doubtful their training include proper tactical movement that best utilize tank whereas the commonly rifleman be not so hamper in effectiveness i have envision that the armorer perhaps the officer of a select group and the like would exercise control over the heavier more complex weapon but if joe bob own an old sherman tank i certainly ask him to give it up follow order from the officer yes since the expense of a tank be so large though chance be it would be jointly purchase and should therefore be jointly maintain and operate this i  ll agree with to a point the state have control over the heavy weapon should not be justification for the state to have them centrally locate keep them spread out such that the ability of the state to lock them up so easy otherwise i would have to assume that state control would rest on the authority of the governor and militia officer have a hard time see how these heavy weapon fairly few in number could not be easily wield by a few people with government support just a you argue above that the weapon should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side have all of them i see where this situation be alleviate in have the select militia hold all the weapon and the unorganized militia be the infantry i think a well mix be call for but i would argue that the federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of it infantry unit we have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government controlled force and if they  ve all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble like to see that heavy stuff say tank offset by the local troups have a few 105  s and anti tank weapon in their armory these would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirement be figure in i suppose quibble over what constitutes heavy equipment so would i but the resource often available to outfit local unit well enough thus we will certainly have to call in others and a mechanize unit carry more stuff faster than anything else perhaps our idea of heavy weapon be different i think main battle tank self propelled artillery and 155mm and up field piece be heavy stuff m113 troop carrier 2 1 2 ton truck humvee  s old m60 tank 105 howitzer be more the stuff of a mechanize infantry actually this be what the guard unit in iowa be currently fielding in some unit perhaps it be just my innate fear of have the real heavy equipment under state control with little but number and light stuff to act a a deterrent allow main battle tank to the state should be balance with anti tank capability in the local rank similarly local unit would need to band together quickly hence small and fast response mean mechanize infantry finally the militia be more than just fight equipment be need for other response the federal army convince should have a very minumum of infantry rely on the state and local militia for these function
 well the attorney of the davidians report on larry king that the tank have actually damage the structure to the extent that effectuate egress from the building be difficult at best with a rapidly spread fire and large amount of smoke and tear gas find the right exit or acceptible hole in the wall be nearly impossible i find this explanation to be completely plausible mean that true but i find it intrinsically less believable than the government story i concur indeed accord to the lawyer the davidian survivor say that lantern be knock over during the    probe    and how the fire start a tragic accident if true see above this one be go to be thoroughly investigate maybe eventually get some idea of what happen my view be that from begin to end this operation be a botch and that it be completely possible that nut case who be otherwise law abiding citizen be victim of a bureaucratic execution    paul hager hagerp moose cs indiana edu

 there  s only one way i know of to tell an ar 15 from an m 16 pick it up hold it about a foot from your face and look closely at the saftey lever if it have two position it an ar 15 if it have three it an m 16 there be numerous internal difference a well but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see them they be not valid in this discussion so in conclusion there be very little external difference to distinguish an ar 15 from an m 16 except at close very close range david bixler auburn university

 so kratz be there do that mean that a gang member even in the most gang infested area most of the resident be not gang members how be it obvious be they not try to hit the target or do kratz confuse    marksmanship    with    try to simulate a post    if so that excludes self defense shoot but the rest of u understand that that exclusion would be an error it excludes a lot of legit    gun game    a well sound like practical pistol or maybe ipsc it also sound like how a self defense shooter might well practice the only thing that action excludes be hunt and    like a post    shoot kratz should get out more often  andy

 at the risk of start the  my gun be well than yours flame war i must disagree there be no secret in handle a glock in fact it be often chosen besides it other merit because it shoot like a revolver do basically it can limit the training time read budget due to the fact there be no  external safties other than the trigger hence less training time require smith wesson among other type be chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties hammer drop a well a mag drop which if properly use have save many life when  mr bad snatch the gun from the officer and try to shoot say officer the gun be on safe and would not fire this point have be make in many article in various gun magazine if fact one author remember who stag a little test where he have a revolver and a s w on safe lay on a table and ask people with little firearm experience to on his signal grab the gun and shoot a target he time the people use each gun the revolver time be pretty close but some of the time with the s w be in minute or the person just give up because they could not figure out the saftey you often see colt 45 auto issue due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fire in a stress situation opening the issue city county etc   to lawsuit bad press etc   of course any problem can be overcome with enough training but such training be not always available to budget crunched department i know if i be a cop i would want something like a s w just for the off chance of the gun get take away the safety guarantee that  mr bad figure it out and shoot me but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot  mr bad before too late think i be too bias here just because i have have 3 glocks in my possession at one time because i have have a  45 a well in fact it be my first handgun remember the ultimate  safety be you the operator and no safety be go to stop an negligent discharge note i say accidental if you break the rule of gun handle a per the part of be light weight and look cool i agree 100 i rule it out a a first purchase

 be it a far a i know tear gas especially in large concentration be very dangerous even toxic for small child this make the fbi  s supposedconcern for the safety of the child seem rather hypocritical
 delete and a far a fully automatic weapon you can be a lot well arm if you want to hit what you aim at define    arm well    go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the colt  45  do one fire faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire be usually not desirable sure it make the other guy duck for cover but just  you  try hit anything with a thompson in hose mode this be why the military be limit m 16 now to 3 round burst fire simple semi auto would be well but the troop like to be able to rock and roll even if it be wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy be plentiful a revolver be equally capable a a semi auto in the same caliber a revolver also have the advantage that if it misfire you just pull the trigger again a double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pull the trigger a misfire in a revolver merely mean you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round a revolver can be carry with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fire with an easy motion even one hand speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost a fast a magazine on semi autos can be faster depend on user a misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so be often lose a you realize    hey jammed    before start to do anything about clearing it most semi autos must have the slide work to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi autos with the chamber load and hammer cocked but a safety engage i do not consider this safe however you must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment a a revolver there be some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them require more training some police department switch to glocks and then start quietly switch many officer back to the old revolver too many be have accident partly due to the poor training they receive not that glocks require rocket scientist but some cop be baffle by something a complex a the timer on a vcr anyone who go anyone say that the criminal obviously outgun the police know nothing about firearm turn off cop and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say    semi autos be junk    merely that assume they be well for all job be stupid a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack be more than equip for anything short of a riot gun control be hit what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you hit anything good control fire from a revolver be more likely to get you a hit i own a 9mm beretta myself but consider it inferior a a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i hit what aim at in the first 5 shot something be quite seriously wrong somewhere while i might like have the backup capacity of those extra shot in certain case overwhelmingly the of shot fire in criminal encounter be less than 5  what do crook overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple  38 revolver that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier  357 magnum but anyway        obplea flame me i prefer semi autos for most thing but they introduce unneccessary complication to something a nerve wracking a an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal
 seal team six should have handle it delta force the batf have more than enough equipment and men they do not have good intel but they do have poor planning they fuck up even in just the most basic military sense they fuck up excuse do not justify body count and your excuse fall upon deaf ear when the same batf have show shitty leadership despite more people well weapon and exclusive use of armor against their target batf be nothing more than a private army of the government do the agent swear an oath a i do to uphold the constitution you know that document that stipulates the high law of the land if they do they should be up for charge in a court of law remember the law the whole reason for any of this yeah be related to many of them this be flame bait right not pay your price mind if i sight in my gun on your body think of it a the price you have to pay that we may all live without fear of my make a stray shot fine and dandy to revel in the other guy be the target and your suppose safety in the military we call this    chicken shit    leadership from the rear the war on drug despite be a catchy term for nothing more than a continuation of policy since before this century seem to have gotten you convince that my right worth your good vibe mind if i cut your net access a well a access to any and all form of expression see you make me nervous what with you be able to influence so many sure you can see how this be the price we have to pay for freedom and liberty in this country a well a a fair and unbiased judiciary mind if we include you in the body count sure we could all file it under    civic improvement    and your life have be sacrifice in vain if you like you can will your estate to defecit reduction too now when you learn how the law protects or protect everybody equally and how our collective boot may one day be on your collective throat perhaps at that time you will mature enough to realize just what talk about and how serious this be next time include a smiley while i hesitate to think that you could have meant this seriously it deserve a small flame anyway
 unfortunately election can and be bought promise the voter money and they will vote for you same here convict felon may not legally purchase firearm that you know of while i live in the dbr a gang robbed a joint u army bundewehr armoury and get several hundred m 16s ammunition handgun and some explosive when i left two year later there be no clue who us them be the problem crime in the u s  be    no big deal    if you be the criminal how about 5 year for murder credit for time serve in jail wait for trial and you be out in 12 month bad case if we would put criminal especially violent one in the slam for true sentence crime would drop instead we reward them for be good and let them out early very early serb croat and muslim have be kill each other almost since before the invention of gun old woman be throw stone at un truck this be a hatred that go beyond reason yes the problem be the user question back since you be one of the rational one if all gun crime be to stop would you support drop all gun control they do not believe from experience that the    police    include national guard could would protect them unless you want to argue that a human be do not have a right to protect him herself they do the right thing what would you suggest a a defense against a mob throw bottle and rock and also likely arm with steal firearm criminal would move to scandinavia the average criminal would look for a less hazardous job and the rest would likely be bury at county expense personally i criticize the fool who send money to the ira to    make ireland free    of course this be the last thing the ira want because they lose power if england pull out but for another group the u s  have roughly 20 time the major sport event a the u k   how many riot do we have at sport event last year off the play field hooligan be a word never use when reffering to sport fan here i guess where the different culture thing come in yes the question be be the problem one of too many gun mostly from the army or not enough nonserbians can not defend themselves but disarm responsible gun owner be not the solution yet that be exactly what hci be propose
 nice we strive for entertainment value in the first place you have to realize the feel go both way canadian laugh at the u s  and american simply shrug and woner why the hell we let them be a state in the first place interest strategy post here with complaint about people elsewhere courtesy be apparently a dead commodity in the rest of the civilize world    gun nut moron    indeed get gun they  ve get a monarch and an economy on the verg of collapse finger point across the atlanticis a waste or time canada have be blame the u s  for their problem for year the simple fact of the matter be this ten year ago they crow about how great their system be because gotten rid of the gun and the u s  would be so much well if just get into the divine light shin from the north we point out that it be cultural difference and point to their pre control crime rate we also point out that the history of the entire world contain smuggle and that whenever something be want it be smuggle in if the problem be base on u s  gun it would have surface year before now more canadian criminal want gun and they be be provide canada have it own version of the drug problem yet drug be prohibit in the u s  saw a news report out of britain that arm crime be on the rise and several police agency be consider have permanent    firearm officer    to deal with it accord to u s  news world report british handgun death have risen over 250 over the past twelve year the u s  number have drop 5 maybe smuggle them across the u s  u k border yeah the ticket have a nice day steve learn a little common courtesy and politeness
 mr  parsli i have to take exception at this there be verifiable previous  examples  of level of u s  government abuse gun control restriction i think it be paranoid to worry that what have be abuse in the recent past might be abuse in thye future after so many time of get burn any sane person will stop put his hand on the stove love to but a long a the politician grab power to sell pork back to their constituent there  s not a lot i can do silly to suggest that if there  s anything we trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allow to do it then we should change government down that road lie total government power never be a fan of totalitarianism this be very likely the north american continent be not europe no matter how many people would like it to be drug be very illegal and here for year canada have crow about it gun control if it be necessary to control gun over the whole continent then canada should have always have comparable rate to the u s  yet they still unless you can tell me why the canadian border be so much more magical than the mexican border which be shorter and far more heavily patrol then i really accept that argument no there be approximately 31 000 death due to gun in the u s  two thirds of which be suicide unfortunately i have suicide rate for norway however this make the per gun death rate about half the per car death rate the problem  s be human since before we have stone ax the fct of the matter be simply this if nobody ever assault anybody whether there be a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent yet weapon be  built  suggest then that the murderous impulse in humanity pre dates weapon anyway the bosnians et al have be make an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand year take away their gun even if we could would neither halt the kill nor reduce the brutality in the u s  approximately 60 of murder be commit with firearm 50 with handgun 10 with non handguns the reason i say that gun per se be not the problem be that our non gun rate exceeds most of europe s country  entire  violent crime rate i really think get more knife or fist in any case i think example of gun control  applied  to the u s  have be abkect failure just like drug prohibition and other form of prohibition until you deal with  why  people be do what they be do you solve your problem and if the problem be violent crime you concentrate on the tool instead the  vast  majority of gun be never ever misuse on the order of 99 5 over the entire lifetime of the gun this say to me that you make the argument that the gun itself cause the misuse the situation be not    good    in that people fear for their life but recall the scene of the store owners during the last riot protect their shop with gun would it have be well they too lose their livelihood the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles no it however if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can be appropriate whether or not some person have be hurt by their condition make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it you have to examine which problem refer to if discuss someone violently assault you then it be a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop hopefully simply let them know prepared to shoot them would be enough a it be with the above mentioned store owners 45 of household have some form of firearm usually a long gun that account for a level of access for at least 100 million american firearm ownership be most likely among educate well off white the group  least  likely to be involve in violent crime you may take that for what worth
 minor quibble the assualt and it be one begin near dawn the fire do not break out for several hour i find it highly unlikely that the bd would be cooking lunch while armored vehicle punch hole in their house and be pump in tear gas the lantern story make more sense except the fire seem to spread too quickly even give the nature of the building and the very high wind and it be daylight but i guess in the innner recess it could be dark    shutter probably close a well which put u back to the fbi do it or the bd do it or some other screw  up occur which be quite possible the problem with the fbi a a monolithic entity do it be that it require  everybody  involve to keep their mouth shut while they tend to behave like total idiot that do not make them homocidal maniac either and if it be one nutcase agent then it serf no purpose to blame the whole agency i can believe that a real nut case like a koresh would start such a fire but far from convince he actually do so then again i rarely go off make blanket condemnation and pronouncments within 2 hour of a very confuse incident over 175 mile away     semper fi
 rate per caput rate the uk be more dangerous though you may be less likely to be kill by a handgun the average individual citizen in the uk be twice a likely to be kill by whatever mean a the average swiss would you feel any well about be kill by mean other than a handgun i what an absurd argument switzerland be one fifth the size of the uk with one eigth a many people therefore at any give point on swiss soil you be more likely to be crow bait more importantly you be 4x a likely to be kill by the next stranger approach you on a swiss street than in the uk you be betraying your lack of understand about rate versus total number rate be express often a  100 000 population therefore if a place have 10 death and a population of 100 000 the rate would be 10 100 000 a place that have 50 death and a population of 1 000 000 would hav a rate of 5 100 000 the former have a high rate the latter a high total you be less likely to die in the latter simple enuff for chrissakes take out your calculator and work out the number here     preformatted them for you to make it easy handgun homicides population                                           switzerland 24 6 350 000 uk 8 55 670 000     and then tell me again how switzerland be safer with a more liberal handgun law than the uk be without     by rate or total number your choice

 i suspect that you think that this be less lethal than the typical    assault weapon    you be wrong compare to what most criminal use a 9mm with military ammo fmjs or a military rifle use be extremely rare  223 or 7 62mm with military ammo fmjs the  32 h r magnum with    civie    bullet be more lethal most of the arm which criminal and the military use be among the least lethal arm in existance
 and sure that be a great comfort to the widow and child of those stabbed beaten and burn to death the real question be    do the crime rate in england go down after they enact gun control law    if you look at the rate before and after their first such law in 1920 you will see no effect

 there be a likely veto proof majority in the house the senate unfortunately be a different story the lt gov have vowed that the bill will not be vote on and he have the power to do it in addition the senate be a much small and more readily manipulate body on ther other hand the semi automatic ban will likely not live a at least fifty per cent of the house currently opposes it and it be very far down in the bill order in the senate i believe it will be address after the ccw bill and i thought my tx political science class be a waste of time

 hmm i beg to differ it will probably make a big difference at some point thankfully it be true that the majority go through life without have to use a firearm howver there be situation where firearm be the most effective mean of self protection what other mean do you propose a equally effective new to this country new to political theory ala i be speak of principle without principle all attempt at republican form of gov t be futile there be time when public and political opinion be contrary to principle which be why we have a constitution which enumerates gov t power and presumes certain right a major reason for this be to prevent a tyranny of the majority this be exactly why law should be base on reason thought not immediate perception of course it always work that way fortunately while there be no guarantee logic sometimes do prevail and if not there be still mean for correction a far a    enough active voter    be concerned that be still an open question until the vote be make you portray a possible scenario for the future but how will you silence rkba supporter right now a long a public debate be allow such debate will continue if we allow public debate to be restrict or deny then we will get a gov t we deserve
 and who be responsible for it not happen certainly not the child koresh be call the shot he be talk with his lawyer and the fbi since others be release safely there be no sane reason for keep the child inside the compound not at all be you a koresh worshiper thanks for my laugh of the day definitely a very silly supposition i would if i could the news show that show the lengthy excerpt also have interview with the filmmaker who make the documentary who basically confirm what be show in the excerpt from the time he spent at the compound in 1992  i believe that this be report by local radio reporter on site a fire start in a three story tower at the same time a the two story window show on the tv coverage i thought about mention how reagan and the military treat the press in grenada and how that set the precedent but decide it worthy of discussion if the news reporter get shot you can bet his family would sue the government for let him into the danger area the root cause of suspicion in my mind be why 100 people flee a building that have numerous exit during the 30 minute time it take to burn down or why they flee hour earlier when the tear gas be first introduce i can find no rational explanation for their behavior

 first i would like to say how much i appreciate have so literate and erudite an individual a mr  rutledge with whom to discus this topic frankly most anti rkba poster refuse even to approach the topic of the original understand of the bill of right a detailed in the writing of the era this be most refresh second i must apologize for leave the discussion for several day my brigade  s quarterly drill be this weekend and i need to attend to several matter pertain to the state militia some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia be an anachro  nism that be out of place in the 20th century not sure the swiss would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia both organize and unorganized fit into the defense plan of my state mississippi please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state for instance the commonwealth of massachusetts have a well organize militia which member report maintains stock of both riot gun and machine gun the law of other state will vary but be probably similar title 35 of mississippi code defines our militia a    all able bodied citizen of the state between the age of seventeen 17 and sixty  two 62 year        the militia be divide into 3 class the national guard the mississippi state guard and the unorganized militia the national guard be a strange sort of fish from a constitutional perspective it try to be both state militia and federal reserve the discussion of this    para constitutional    arrangement be quite interest in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion suffice it that at this date the national guard have cease to have any constitutional stand a anything but a federal reserve force mississippi and most other state maintains a purely state organize militia in mississippi this be call the state guard in other state it may be call something else the state guard exists a a cadre or training corp make up of mostly experienced officer and senior ncos who serve a volunteer without compensation we drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization our state authorized cadre strength be 694  this be a skeleton of an organization without any flesh the muscle and sinew when need will come from the unorganized militia in time of invasion insurrection or calamity the governor can order the activation of the state guard when this take place a call will first be make for volunteer to fill the organization out to either it contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910  in the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer the law provide detailed instruction for the conduct of a draft of the unorganized militia the size of the state guard be not specify by law but rather by executive order at one time the organize militia of mississippi consist of 68 regiment needle to say the state do not have armory brimming with weapon with which to equip such a force the historical precedent for arm such a force be by use of mostly the private arm of the militiaman it be my hope that demonstrates that state militia be far from be the long dead anachronism that some may wish to claim regard hamilton if you take hamilton  s opinion a be the sole representative of the opinion of the found father you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set hamilton be on the extreme federalist end of the political spectrum others such a coxe and henry can be chosen to represent the other end many contemporary felt that the idea of have a stand army of any sort or even a select militia or    train band    be contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern  ment they be strive to perfect the compromise reach be to provide for a small army which have to be refinance every two year and iron clad protection for the militia which be to remain ever    terrible and irresistible    these protection include state control not federal limitation of federal utilization of the militia i e execute law suppress insurrection and repel invasion and the right to keep and bear arm to prevent what the british have try to do at lexington these limitation eventually prove so onerous to the federal govern  ment that they be skirt by the creation of the national guard the national guard be create for one very simple reason the constitutional militia be have prove too unreliable for fight war of imperial expansion e g spanish american war the constitution provide that the militia could only be employ by the federal government in very limited purpose a far back a the war of 1812 militia unit have refuse to leave united state territory to attack the enemy far there be no constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the federal military and militiaman be particularly protect in all war until ww i every american who left the country under arm be a volunteer when the national guard act of 1903 1916 require that each new member also enlist a a reservest in the army exist soldier be    grandfathered    at least one of these    grandfathered    individual refuse to go to france in 1918 and his refusal be upheld by the federal court mr  rutledge have state that the second amendment applies only to member of a    well organize    militia however the pre constitutional history of the american militia show relatively few period when the militia come close to meeting either messrs  rutledge or hamilton s definition of    well organize    in the period of peace between the french indian war and the revolution many company simply stop drilling and have to be reconstitute just prior to the revolution perhaps mr  rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestor who answer the lexington alarm have forfeit their right because their unit drill for a few year in the 1760s i would not be so bold again i wish to repeat the national guard for all it merit be not the militia described by the constitution nor by mr  hamilton nor by mr  henry nor by mr  coxe the fact that the federal government and many state be delinquent in their attention to and organize of their constitutional militia diminishes neither their responsibility nor the right of the militia a detailed in the constitution misunderstand of the nature and purpose of the militia be but one error that have crept into modern reading of the constitution the constitution prohibits state from keep    troop or ship of war in time of peace    i have heard some insist this prevents state from maintain a militia but this come about because people today do not understand the meaning of the word in their 18th century usage today we call any large vessel a    ship    but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel a    ship    be a large vessel with three or more mast each carry square rig sail a    brig    have two mast in the contemporary usage the state be prohibit only from keep the large warship of the day those capable of global operation today s equivalent might be a prohibition on the state keep nuclear missile    troop    at this time meant a full time professional military organization any study of contemporaneous writing will bear this out in at least one respect i be in agreement with mr  rutledge be personally involve in the maintenance and advancement of the militia a a viable mean of defense for a modern society i be frequently both bemuse and sadden when friend and associate wax poetic on their place in the unorganized militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invite to attend a drill of their state  s militia

 that be the entire point to  you  what exactly do i claim                                                                               heard eye witness description of tank use their main gun to respond to sniper fire quite effectively                                                                               i wrong heard those description if pay attention mention that i saw the tank with my own eye but the main gun fire be an account i heard that help people judge whether or not to kick in the to use your word    bullshit filter    state that i  claimed  this be a falsehood later in the same post another part of my memory be that while most damage building be burnt some be in rubble base on what i remember i be and be inclined to believe an old sarge or two fine  now  you be state that you believe their claim or that you be    inclined    to see below for a strong statement of your belief those claim be still ludicrous however previously awesley have write you can also read of the troop use grenade launcher prompt me to write to fire fragmentary grenade i doubt that a well to fire concussion grenade perhaps to fire tear gas certainly but you would be perfectly willing to let u believe they fire frags you since it make your other claim seem more plausible to which awesley reply john again strawman technique do you feel lose it so you have to stretch what i say and knock that down what i read say nothing about what they fire and so i put nothing in there if you need some help let me know and i l take your side of this for a while not score here boring here but why do you mention grenade launcher at all because it support the notion that the tank shell building and it support that notion because it conjures image of troop launch fragmentary grenade but that too be ludicrous if tank have fire their main gun in detroit people would have be scream about it for the past two and half decade i would know about it awesley rely glad to know such an expert nice to hear some an authority i especially appreciate your basis of knowledge    if it have happen you would have know it since you be such an authority you probably know that people do scream about an allege massive cover up in the number of people kill in the detroit riot some claimed 100  dead others say 300  the offical number be 43 but the concise columbia encyclopedia say it be    several    also heard some thing about that but i dare repeat them assert that i claimed they be truth yes if it happen i would have heard about it everybody would have army tank fire their cannon in american city in the 1960 s without it become common knowledge without minority leader seize on it and condemn it over and over again without civil libertarian say    this have go far enough    so yes my never hearing of it be the basis for my disbelieve the claim now i have more reason to disbelieve it not one poster have write to say yes i live in detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tank have fire shell this be the usenet if it have happen somebody here would remember it furthermore your own research fail to come up with any support for the claim the claim be extraordinary and it have no support evidence extraordinary or not unless you count the brag of a couple of guardsman shoot the shit i do not unless you also claim that the national guard manage to cover it up take the tour after the riot it be pretty easy to tell the difference between army and guard troop or so i recall from 26 year ago and i seem to recall it be the army run the tank so it would have be an army cover up quibble fine it be an army cover up six year in the reserve have taught me the difference also but do you think that in two and half decade not one guilt ridden participant have come forward and say    yes i shell american    or    i give the order to fire the cannon    or    i help cover it up    if your mind be open enough to believe that well good for you i prefer to live in reality and here in reality i find it hard to believe that those tank even have any shell much less fire them awesley reply give the level in destruction in detroit quite willing to believe that they do fire their gun good then we can drop the junk about you not claim that they do your belief fails a basic reality check why it know awesley concludes now then bore the shit out of anyone whose bother to read this far and all manage to say be that you believe the account i cite actually now we have establish that i believe what you believe a well a why i believe it and if boring then i yield the last word to you if you want it you may say anything you like with impunity    i be drop the subject

 here be a press release from the white house president clinton  s remark on waco with q a to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary 202 456 2100 washington april 20  u s newswire     follow be remark by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press part 2 of 2 go ahead sarah q there be two question i want to ask you the first be i think that they knew very well that the child do not have gas mask while the adult do so the child have no chance because this gas be very    she say it be not lethal but it be very dangerous to the child and they could not have survive without gas mask and on february 28th    let  s go back    those people have a right to practice their religion the president they be not just practice their religion they be    the treasury department believe that they have violate federal law any number of them q what federal law    the president let me go back and answer    i answer the question about the gas mask except to tell you that the whole purpose of use the tear gas be that it have be test they be convince that it kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathe it to run outside and one of the thing that heard    i want to get into the detail of this because i know    but one of the thing that they be speculate about today be that the wind be blowing so fast that the window might have be open and some of the gas might have escape and that may be why it have the desire effect they also knew sarah that there be an underground compound    a bus bury underground where the child could be sent and they be    i think they be hop very much that if the child be not release immediately outside that the humane thing would be do and that the child would be sent someplace where they could be protect in term of the gas mask themselves i learn yesterday    i do not ask this fact question before    that the gas be suppose to stay active in the compound longer than the gas mask themselves be to work so that it be thought that even if they all have gas mask that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance ms  myers last question q mr  president why be you still say that    q could you tell u whether or not you ever ask janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide and when you learn about the actual fire and explosion what go through your mind during those horrendous moment the president what i ask janet reno be if they have consider all the bad thing that could happen and she say    and of course the whole issue of suicide have be raise in the public    he have    that have be debate anyway and she say that the people who be most knowledgeable about these kind of issue conclude that there be no great risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future that be the judgment they make whether they be right or wrong of course we will never know what happen when i saw the fire when i saw the building burning i be sick i felt terrible and my immediate concern be whether the child have gotten out and whether they be escape or whether they be inside try to burn themselves up the first thing i want to know thank you q mr  president why be you still say it be a janet reno decision it in the end your decision the president well what say be that i have a four  or five hour detailed briefing from the fbi i go over every strategic part of it it be a decision for which i take responsibility the president of the united state and i sign off on the general decision and give her the authority to make the last call when i talk to her on sunday some time have elapse she might have make a decision to change her mind i say if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow i will support you and i do support her she be not ultimately responsible to the american people i be but i think she have conduct her duty in an appropriate fashion and she have dealt with this situation i think a well a she could have thank you applause

 first of all let  s assume that you be right that few gun would make it in to the country that sound great to those that see gun a inherently evil except then every one of those gun would be in the hand of someone who obviously care less about follow the law after all they get the gun illegally so be more likely to commit a crime with that gun great then everyone with a gun be likely to use it in a crime nice system now a to reduce the number of gun come into society by make it illegal to manufacture sell or import them in this coutry let me use a parallel for empiric evidence the amount of cocaine in this country be far less since it manufacture sale and importation be out lawwed if that last statement be true then perhaps we should consider your plan this could also apply to drug in general

ground would you deny them these gun their religion the fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves because you consider them to be a cult maybe i consider your church to be a cult this

1 5 that of the u 10 000 35 5 weight for population the u have 57x a many handgun related death a the uk and no the brit make up for this by murder 57x a many people with baseball bat you just compare this way all homicide must be show per caput not just handgun the availability of them in the usa make them the prefer murder weapon but ban them and some other weapon will step in a the favorite a a

that if gun murderer be deprive of gun that they would find a way to kill a often with knife if this be so knife attack in city where gun be widely use in homicide would be expect to show a low fatality rate and knife attack in city where gun be not so widely use like vancouver would show a high fatality rate but the nat l commission on the cause and prevention of violence task force analyze the data and found this not to be the case it appear to them that a the number of knife attack increase in relation to the number of firearm attack which presumably happen where gun be less available to assailant the proportion of fatal knife attack do not increase relative to the proportion of gun attack in fact the reverse be true what be found be that most homicide do not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill fatality cause by knife tend to show a single mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury multiple stab wound wound concentrate about the head neck and chest etc most gun homicide do not show this pattern rather more fatal attack be commit during a moment of rage and not the focus intent to kill the victim source report on firearm and violence then since england usa my ancestor left because of the oppression you must compare england before strict gun law to england after strict gun law to be able to draw any meaning at all england have essentially legalize drug so there be no drug gang battling for turf etc  there if you drop out the drug related killing here the usa would look a whole lot more peaceful there be a lot of factor which make a difference actually not fond of make any kind of social parallel between european and american there be more cultural beahvioral and economic difference between u than similarity i just sort of found myself back into that corner over the last couple of week i think we could ever attain the low level of european violent crime here in the u whether we ban gun or require every law abiding citizen to carry a load uzi on the other hand we can draw lesson from neighbor who be more culturally similar namely the canadian in fact an exhaustive seven year study have already be do of the respective crime rate of vancouver british columbia and seattle washington     city with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approach to gun control in seattle handgun may be purchase legally for self defense after a 30 day wait period a permit can be obtain to carry a conceal weapon the recreational use of handgun be minimally restrict in vancouver self defense be not consider a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun conceal weapon be not permit recreational us of handgun target shoot collect be regulate by the province purchase of a handgun require a restricted weapons permit a permit to carry may be obtain in order to transport the weapon to license shoot club handgun transport by vehicle must be store in the trunk in a lock box in short gun control but not unreasonably so both city aggressively enforce their gun law conviction for gun related offense carry similar penalty the researcher study all case of robbery assault simple and aggravate burglary and homicide occur in seattle and vancouver from 1 1 80 to 12 31 86 in define the case they use the same standard the fbi  s unified crime report result during the seven year study the annual rate of robbery in seattle be found to be only slightly high than that in vancouver 1 09 1 11 burglary occur at nearly identical rate  99 18 925 assault be record in seattle versus 12 034 in vancouver the risk of be a victim of a simple assault in seattle be found to be only slightly high than vancouver 1 18 1 15 and the risk of aggravate assault be also slightly high 1 16 1 12 however when aggravate assault be subdivide by weapon and the mechanism of assault a clear pattern emerge although both city report nearly identical rate of aggravate assault involve knife and other dangerous weapon firearm be far more likely to be use in seattle in fact 7 7 time a often over the seven year study 388 homicide occur in seattle 11 3 per 100 000 vs  204 homicide in vancouver 6 9 per 100 000 after adjustment for difference in age and sex among the population the relative risk of be a victim of homicide in seattle a compare to vancouver be found to be 1 63  when homicide be subdivide by the mechanism of death the rate of homicide by knife and other weapon exclude firearm in seattle be found to be almost identical to that in vancouver virtually all of the increase risk of death in seattle be due to a more than fivefold high rate of homicide by firearm handgun account for roughly 85 of homicide involve firearm handgun be 4 8 time more likely to be use in homicide in seattle than in vancouver the author of the report also investigate    legally justifiable    homicide self defense only 32 such homicide occur during the seven year study 11 of which be commit by police only 21 case of civilian act in self defense occurrred 17 in seattle and 4 in vancouver only 13 involve firearm after exclude these case there be virtually no impact on these earlier finding          this be i feel a very fair report one might even make the argument that it be bias against canada a a whole because vancouver report annual rate of homicide two to three time that of ottawa calgary and toronto while seattle report annual homicide rate only half to two thirds that of nyc chicago los angeles and houston critic of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handgun will have little effect on the rate of homicide because person intent on kill others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other mean this report show differently if the rate of homicide in a community be influence more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapon we could expect the rate of homicide by weapon other than gun to be high in vancouver than in seattle however during the study interval vancouver  s rate of homicide by weapon other than gun be not significantly high than that in seattle suggest that few would be assailant switch to homicide by other method a well ready access to handgun for self defense by law abiding citizen be not endorse in this report although seattle do experience a high rate of firearm death for self defense these case account for less than 4 of the homicide in both city during the course of the study period and a be report seattle apparently enjoy relief from any crime category over vancouver because citizen may legally arm themselves for self defense heavily quote source handgun regulation crime assault and homicide a tale of two city john h  sloan arthur l  kellerman

 i think that hci people honestly believe that passing more gun control law will be in the best interest of public safety why do i think this because i use to buy the hci line during my freshman year 1987 their line make so much sense    only people who    need    gun should be able to get them and the people who    need    them be the police and other elite unfortunately for u this position be highly emotional and not well thought out they never stop to think that hci  s position basically say that the non elite be incompetent you and me folk and that the second amendment have absolutely nothing to do with hunt or other    legitimate    us which excludes overthrow tyrannical government and defend yourself when the police have proven they protect you every pro control person talk to be always left stump when i simply argue the fact of gun control that it have yet to be proven to low crime rate and weapon terminology and no expert    but explain exactly how an    evil    semiautomatic weapon really work do wonder i hvae personally found well reasoned argument to be most effective against the emotional pro control people the trick be to get them to realize that the second amendment exists not for hunter but for the oppress and the terrorize

 so your opinion be truth i see     you can believe that if you wish it be undeniable however that people have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff and since their leader be preach that they would have an apocalypse you can not say undeniably that there have be a mass suicide if the fbi have simply stayed outside and wait another 51 day i be the heartless bleeding heart you be not make sense you seem to have no concern that someone would keep child inside this compound when they have 51 day to let them out that sound pretty heartless to me i just heard on the news that some of the survivor regret they stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to koresh this make me sad and sick have you ever heard of jonestown the sad thing be the people inside the compound be the authority worshiper and their only authority be koresh howell if these people be able to think for themselves there would likely be a lot more survivor today koresh preach a fiery apocalypse a early a last year by all mean the fbi should be investigate too btw i thought the second ammendment be god
 would  you  have come out if you knew the only national tv camera be well over a mile away and yet the agent with the gun be only a few yard away they have contact with a lawyer so i be inclined to believe they have an idea of what their situation actually be this also lead to the conspiracy theory that the lawyer have the batf pin on right violation if the bd s act a witness hence the arson i doubt that one too but it be still quite clear that leave a safe place to surrender be a rather stupid thing to do until that place be no longer safe a a matter of course give how they  ve allow no other view to be heard i  ll reserve judgement until the trial but so far a the fbi be concerned their statement carry the same amount of weight a photon at rest ludicrous yes possible yes plausible get the jury what get me too it be likely the cult member be hole up in an enforce place inside the building with a decent arson attempt i suspect many of them could have be trap in addition the introduction of c gas for several hour would have render many of them immobile if not unconscious when their mask quit all the prop be there but prove what scene be played be difficult the only certainty be that the fbi and batf have few witness against them

 a note on the lighter side notice most gun banners some of my friend include be the one who make comment that indicate they be more likely to resort to violent so be they really ban gun so they end up shoot someone else could be it be also likely that since they feel they be more likely to resort to violence they have a hard time believe that anyone else would react otherwise
 all very true go on what i have read and heard from friend basically the glock be great but i have heard read that it be a lot harder to learn proper handle because of the type of safety that it have i be look at a glock  40s w and the s w 4006 a couple of week ago and the safties on the gun be very different the saftey on the 4006 seem a lot more    safe    for lack of a well word than the one on the glock of course this could also be a bad thing if you be to pull the gun on somebody you would spend more time fiddle around turn the safety off personally i like the glocks because they be very light and i think they look really cool guess why they use them in so many movie but i get one a my first semi auto because of the safety i would prefer more training with a    traditional    semi auto ala colt  45 but of course just my opinion

 wrong about the whole guns for protection mindset it ignores the why if not a threat not affected at all aha the part that make me nervous too who get to decide if i be a threat base on appearance would someone feel more threaten action determine whether someone present a threat     and i carry a gun so much for people cause i tend to fade if there be any about but due to several encounter with formerly domestic dog     these critter ai n t scar of folk and can get aggressive on stay at and saw someone sit there cleaning his gun softly i back away and hike another 5 mile to get  out of there  i  ll freely admit it here not afraid of gun afraid of people that bring them into the backcountry count that a a fear of gun     somebody have the sense to keep their weapon maintain a likely to present a threat the army taught me to clean any weapon daily since they usually need it regardless of whether they  ve be use     be amaze how sweaty a holster can get or how much trail dust will get in it and i guess be scar of me and my former explorer post     seem the advisor be national guard special force grunt and consider it heresy to be out in the wood without a weapon     course usually you notice  em     they tend to avoid public scrutiny     of course that may be the way to solve the solitude problem just carry a gun and display it prominently and one probably see most of the other hiker out there who will be hiding in the wood 1 2 dania my 9mm go in a hip holster mixed in with magazine pouch hold lotsa stuff in them canteen knife compass and such     not so easy to notice in the off chance i decide to be visible     i prefer not to be since walk quietly away from active area increase the number of non human type critter i see     james

 i think such a canada be any more    culturally similar    to the united state than england in term of law regard individual right restriction on police search etc     all closely related to crime canadian law parallel england  s and differ greatly from those of the united state actually they do not have    roughly the same     urban economy    and extremely different ethnic composition however if you account for economic and ethnic difference the difference disappears completely seattle  s minority be predominatly poor while vancouver  s be middle or upper class the rate for white in both city be found to be identicle while the rate for poor seattle minority be almost three time a great a for the well to do minority of vancouver the pattern seem to be one of poverty and race relation not one of gun control that be a gross distortion    self defense    do not mean kill the attacker there be 21 case of civilian kill their attacker in self defence but such case represent less that 0 5 of the crime prevent by arm self defence for every case you cite there be over 200 other case of self defence where the crime be prevent but the attacker be not kill 0 5 by the way be the most conservative possible figure base on the national crime survey  s estimate of 80 000 crime prevent by arm self defence each year most other study on the subject put the figure at 500 000 to 600 000  those figure would imply less than 0 08 of sucessful self defence involve kill the attacker so more correctly there over 4000 possibly a many a 25 000 case of civilian act in self defence only 21 of which result in the death of the attacker this be a significant factor in comparison to the 592 homicide if memory serf homicide make up approximately 1 of the violent crime the study consider so the fair comparison would be 40 250 homicide prevent and 592 homicide clearly the study can not be close to accurate since it ignore these case of self defence

 post by cathy smith for l  neil smith weird science everyone know how to tell when a politician be lie his lip move what may not be equally obvious be that there be politician and then there be politician    and that the phrase    political science    be subject to more than one interpretation year ago we heard how    scientist    be worried that a new ice age might be come and later on that    nuclear winter       smoke and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full scale international unpleasantness    be a possibility something like that may even have kill the dinosaur what we hear be that no actual data support any of this that real world event the burning of kuwaiti oil field tend to discredit it that mostly it be propaganda meant to weaken value that make america the most successful culture in history and that the dinosaur probably die of something like the plague when continent drift together expose them to new germ we miss a lot like this unless we listen closely prince william sound site of the famous oil spill and mount st  helen  s suppose to recover from their respective disaster for at least 100 year that turn out not to be true although never know it from watch network nightly news or cnn it fit their agenda to inform u that the earth be vast and resilient and that nature be rougher on herself than we could ever be but for once the medium entirely to blame a ignorant of science a they be of everything they trust    scientist    to unscrew the inscrutable the trouble be that today  s    scientist    have agenda of their own nobody in government that wellspring of scientific wherewithal be go to offer grant to an investigator who state truthfully that there be no respectable evidence for    global warm    the money and power for bureaucrat and politician lie in mass transit and they hate the automobile    blame a a major cause of the mythical crisis    a a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable the same appear true of    acid rain    a deliberate hoax cooked up by the environmental protection agency which hate private industrial capitalism almost a much a it do your car and foist on real scientist through trickery which have depend on specialist in different field not talk to each other much the list go on always with a common disreputable thread    ozone depletion    for which evidence be even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warm be no more than a last desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central planning and the command economy have fail and can only find this final wither leg to teeter on decade of anti nuclear alarmism rest on foundation of myth and panic mongering have fail to erase the fact that nuclear power be the safest cleanest most efficient source of energy know to mankind    and more to the point that the great amount of energy there be available to any individual in society the freer that individual    and his society    become honest study on the effect of individual gun ownership and self defense on crime    conduct by investigator who begin a ideological opponent to those concept but which show massive reduction in

smoking    be that although some harm to non  smoker may have be detect it be less by an order or two of magnitude than that associate with fry bacon a couple time a week or keep a pet bird enough to make you wonder whether there be ever anything to the claim that smoking cause cancer that of course be the real threat represent by politically correct science the world be a dangerous place it would be nice to know the hazard never believe smoking to be a healthy practice but give a lack of credibility on the part of today  s science how be i to decide what to do about it nicotine be highly addictive to that much i can attest from experience yet the stress of quit may be riskier than to continue there any way to tell thanks to the corrupt influence of government money on the scientific

archive general information and anonymous ftp instruction the moderator of the firearms politics mail list karl kleinpaste have agree to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for rkba related information this directory can be use for thing like article by kates wright tonso levinson supreme court decision the ria v u decision copy of legislation and so on not meant to be for the discussion that normally appear here so in the future if look for something check there first and then ask here instruction short version for techie the site be godiva nectar cs cmu edu place contribution into the directory  usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba the ftp command get put mget or mput should work give the command    type binary    to be sure file be transfer correctly your file will be move to the rkba directory to get a file use the command get or mget i will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already be archive long version for non techies in order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the internet to connect to the archive site run the command ftp godiva nectar cs cmu edu if that work you can not use this archive if the ftp command be successful get this prompt ask you for a login name godiva nectar cs cmu edu lvc instead of lvc your initial will appear answer this prompt with ftp next get this prompt ask your for your e mail address guest login ok send e mail address a password i would enter l v cipriani att com enter your own e mail address get these line or similar a output remote system be unix use binary mode to transfer file next the command prompt be print ftp if you do not get the line    use binary mode to transfer file    run the command type binary now log in to the archive machine there be many directory on this machine but the two you be concerned with be  usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba and  usr0 anon pub firearms politics incoming there be subdirectory to the rkba directory those be discuss below when you login to the system your directory be  usr0 anon to retreive file change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command cd  usr0 anon pub firearms politics rkba or cd pub firearms politics rkba to submit file change your directory to the incoming directory with the command cd  usr0 anon pub firearms politics incoming or cd pub firearms politics incoming once you do this get another ftp prompt ask you to enter another command to find the name of the exist file in the directory you be in run the command l  l this will produce something like

36079 aug 4 1992 aclu     and so on     each line corresponds to one file reading right to left the field be the file name the last modification date of the file the size of the file in byte and some permission field which you do not need to be concerned with to get a file run the command    get    follow by the name of the file you want for example get index or get noduty after the file be transfer to your machine a message like this transfer complete 19580 byte receive in 5 second 4 kbytes s you can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive you can use the mget command to retreive multiple file if the file you want be in a subdirectory for example congress 103rd hr1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it cd congress 103rd get hr1025 once finish you can log off with the command quit if you have a file you want to contribute the procedure be a little different first of all you should find out if the file already exists so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you repeat an entry the index will have a description of each of the file in the rkba directory for example                                                                                                          file whitemanslaw white man  s law by william r  tonso from the december 1985

directory command see above once you be in the incoming directory use the command put file_name in this case put whitemanslaw again there  ll be a    transfer complete so many byte transfer in so many second    message now your file be on the archive machine another thing to watch out for be duplicate file  names  be sure there a file in the incoming directory that be call the same a the file you want to write if you use the same name overwrite the previous file or get an error message your file may have to be rename if there be a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory once your file be in the incoming directory send me an entry for the index file and i will add it to the file if you can not use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and i  ll take care of the rest if you submit a file and do not notify me it may be remove so be sure to let me know first if you have any question feel free to ask me                                                                                                             larry cipriani    l v cipriani att com
