 now i be jumping into the middle of this thread so i may not know what y all be talk about but i have a few comment there be a number of other factor that be very important the three big be air velocity air momentum and shock wave velocity stack have be use for year and be now be use inside of stock airboxes on a number of bike at a tune engine rpm the stack can greatly increase the speed and thus momentum of the air rush in air momentum be critical in get good air intake the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force it way inside long after the piston have begin it compressive up stroke shock wave be use to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escape out the exzhaust port shock wave be the product of expansion chamber or any other mean of present a  wall opening or closing to the air in motion beyond this i be lose in the mystery of how they design for shock wave

 this be not good advice a couple of year i be involve in a low speed getoff in which i land on my back on the pavement my head helmeted hit the pavement with a    clunk    leave a couple of ding and chip in the paint at the point of impact but no other visible damage i call the helmet manufacturer and inquire about damage they say that the way a fiberglass shell work be to first give then delaminate then crack this be the way fiberglass serf to spread the force of the impact over a wider area after the fiberglass have do it thing the crushable foam liner take care of absorb hopefully the remain impact force they told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality delamination of the glass resin layer can occur with no visible sign either inside or outside of the helmet they suggest that i send them the helmet and they would inspect it include x raying i do so they sent back the helmet with a letter state that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection i suspect that this letter would eliminate their be able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event i be to sue them the bottom line though be that it appear that a helmet integrity can be compromise with no visible sign the only way to know for sure be to send it back and have it inspect note that some helmet manufacturer provide inspection service and some do not another point to consider when purchasing a lid

 it depends on the bike once found a bike interested in call some insurance company for rate some bike be much cheaper to insure than you might think my ex 500 only cost me 127 year in st  louis 27 for a first bike i recommend 500cc  s or less and a bike short enough to get both foot on the ground when you stop the one piece of advice everyone will give you be to take a motorcycle safety foundation rider  s course see a dealer for detail in some state completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance it will also teach you to ride properly from the begin so you learn any bad habit good luck rid a motorcycle be the most fun you can have naked or otherwise
 hey man you brought it up i agree completely drive drunk be really stupid and i understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it but dwi be endemic in our society it be a real problem and we a motorcyclist can be in the bad of vulnerable position around a drunk driver alert reader might remember that last year i witness a dwi accident right bloody in front of me and be unable to save the life of one of the participant a i report here also drunk drive by motorcyclist be a prime cause of their injury and death which raise the insurance rate force stupidly restrictive law and turn the public against those of u who ride responsibly in my view drunk drive should carry a mandatory prison sentence it be one of the traffic offense which be not a public fund issue but a genuine safety issue so if you bring up the subject on rec moto admit have be caught dwi and look for sympathy over the consequence expect people to respond with warm wish
 i think of another subject that generates a much contradictory advice a traffic law and their enforcement everybody  s get an opinion and be dead certain they be right yet acurate information be extremely difficult to come by the dmv know cop know your traffic school instructor know the vehicle code only tell part of the story judge choose to interpret the law in a wide variety of way and the public at large i seldom hear any advice that disagree with something experienced if you believe me i suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code study it and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens read    fight your ticket    too but miss the little section at the end where it say your chance be lousy and basically screw a you may have guess pretty down on the system here in california carefully prepared for court bring witness and reveal serious hole in the officer  s story only to be slap with the maximum allowable fine plus assessment of over 100 the message clear that the judge do not appreciate john q public try his own case so here  s my advice when you find yourself with a ticket take traffic school if you can if a serious matter get a lawyer a lawyer can present the exact same case a you the difference be the sentence

lightning rod for flame if you post to the whole net and look like a clueless newbie too by now probably ask    so who  s the kotl already    well a john sloan note below about the only real    secret    left around here but a few un subtle hint can be divulge first it be not myself nor anyone mention by name in this post maybe though john be the original kotl second in keep with the true spirit of

                  one more thing the kotl say that it telepathic power what they use to be so provide some information for the list will ya the typical dod list entry contains number name state country e mail address for example 0111 ed green ca ed green east sun com p while john mention below that net access and a bike be the only requirement for dod membership not strictly true these day a

                     denizen of doom    by bruce tanner dod 0161 road rider august 1991 reprint with bruce  s permission there be a group of motorcyclist that get together and do all the normal thing that a bunch of bikers do they discus motorcycle and motorcycle beverage cleaning fluid baklavah balaclava caltrop helmet anti fog shield spine protector aerodynamics three angle valve seat bird hit deer whistle good restaurant race philosophy traffic law ticket corrosion control personality pun double entendres culture absence of culture first ride and friendship they argue with each other and plan ride together the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club be that although they get together just about everyday most have never see each other face to face the member of this group live all over the know world and communicate with each other electronically via computer the computer range from laptop to multi million dollar computer center the people range from college and university student to high tech industry professional to public access electronic bulletin board user currently rec motorcycles pronounce    wreck dot motorcycles    the file name for the group  s primary on line    meeting place    carry about 2250 article per month it be read by an estimate 29 000 people most of the frequent poster belong to a motorcycle club the denizen of doom usually refer to a the dod the dod start when motorcyclist john r  nickerson write a couple of parody design to poke fun at motorcycle stereotype fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson post these article under the pen name    denizen of doom    a while later chuck rogers sign off a dod nr 0003 keeper of the flame bruce be then designate dod nr 0002 retroactively and of course nickerson the originator of the parody be give dod nr 0001  the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meeting and no rule appeal to many so john sloan    dod nr 0011    become keeper of the list issue dod number to anyone who want one to date there have be almost 400 membership issue to people all over the united state and canada a well a australia new zealand the united kingdom france germany norway and finland keeper of the list sloan eventually design a club patch the initial run of 300 patch sell out immediately the profit from this go to the american motorcycle heritage foundation another amhf fund raiser    sell denizen of doom pin to member    be start by arnie skurow a few month later again the project be successful and the profit be donate to the foundation so far the denizen have contribute over 1500 to the ama museum a plaque in the name of the denizen of doom now hang in the motorcycle heritage museum a often a possible the dod ers crawl out from behind their crt and go rid together it turn out that the two large concentration of dod ers be center near denver boulder colorado and in california  s    silicon valley    consequently two major event be the annual assault on rollins pas in colorado and the northern versus southern california    joust    the ride and feed be a bike trip over rollins pas follow by a big barbecue dinner the concept for the joust be to have rider from northern california ride south rider from southern california to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle an additional plan for 1991 be to hold an official denizen of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus ohio in july though a safe bet the the denizen of doom and their collective communication hub rec motorcycles will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organization for those who prowl the electronic pathway in search of two wheeled camaraderie a great way for kindred spirit to get together long may they flame    live to flame    flame to live    centerbar this official motto of the denizen of doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to face these insult be know a    flame    issue them be call    flame    flame often start when a member disagrees with something another member have post over the network a typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reason rebuttal would be something like    what an incredibly stupid statement you spandex clad poseur    this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster describe just what they think of you your rid ability and your cat                                                                                                             _the denizen of doom the saga unfolds_ by john sloan dod 0011 periodically the question    what be dod    be raise this be one of those question in the same class a    why be the sky blue       if there be a god why be there so much suffer in the world    and    why do woman inevitably tell you that such a nice guy just before they dump you    the kind of question steep in mysticism tradition and philosophy question that have inspire research and discussion by philosopher in locker room motorcycle service bay and in the hall of academe for generation a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minute be an eternity and the halt problem really be a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speak two machine in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago a chap who wish to remain anonymous but who be eventually assign the dod membership 1 write a satire of the various personality and flame war of rec motorcycles and sign it    the denizen of doom    not wish to identify himself he ask that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod 2 to post it for him dod 2 not really give a whit about what other people thought and generally be a right think individual do so flame and other amusement follow he who would become the holder of dod membership 3 thought this be the funniest thing see in a while be the sort that be pretty easily amuse so he claimed membership in the denizen of doom motorcycle club and start signing his posting with his membership number perhaps reader of rec motorcycles be struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no due no rule no restriction a to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organize electronically it may well be that reader be yearn to become a part of something that would provide them with a great identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole be great than the sum of it part it could also be that all computer nerd who wear black sock and sneaker and pocket protector who just happen to also love take risk on machine with awesome power to weight ratio social outcast who saw a clique that would finally be open mind enough to accept u a member in a clear case of self fulfil prophesy the denizen of doom motorcycle club be born a club in which the majority of member have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough give some of the electronic personality in the newsgroup a club organize and run in the loose sense of the word by volunteer through the network via electronic news and mail with a membership mailing list often use to organize group ride amongst member who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo album circulate around the country organize by dod 9 club patch organize by 11 and even an mtv style music video produce by 47 and distribute on vhs by 18 where will it end who know will the dod start sanction race place limit on the memory and clock rate of the on board engine management computer will the dod organize poker run where each participant collect a hand of hardware and software reference card will the dod have a rally in which the attendee demand a terminal room and at least a 386 sized unix system only time will tell the dod have no due no rule and no requirement other than net access and a love for motorcycle to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask be one of the few really good club secret new member will receive via email a membership number and the late copy of the membership list which include name state and email address the denizen of doom motorcycle club will live forever or at least until next year when we may decide to change the name live to flame flame to live                                                                                                             the dod

denizen who have watch the movie    top gun    a few time too many rise to the occasion and reply    classify we could tell you but then have to kill you    and the rest be history a variation on the    security    theme be to supply disinformation about what dod stand for notable contribution and contributers where know include daughter of democracy dod 23 doer of donut dancer of despair dod 9 debaser of daughter dickweeds of denver driveway of death debaucher of donut dumper of dirtbikes note that this be not a comprehensive list a variation appear to be limited only by the content of one  s imagination or dictionary file                                                                                                             the rec moto photo archive first a bit of history this all start with ilana stern and chuck rogers organize a rec motorcycles photo album many copy be make and several set be sent on tour around the world only to vanish in unknown location then bruce tanner decide that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce have not only provide the disk space and ftp e mail access but he have take the time to scan most of the photo that be available from the archive not only can you see what all these folk look like you can also gawk at their motorcycle a few non photo file be available from the server too they include the dod membership list the dod yellow page the general rec motorcycles faq and this faq post here be a couple of excerpt from from message bruce post about how to use the archive                                                            via ftp cerritos edu 130 150 200 21 via e mail the address be server cerritos edu the command be give in the body of the message the current command be dir and send give one per line the argument to the command be vms style file specification for rec moto photo the file spec be dod file for example you can send dir dod send dod bruce_tanner gif send dod dodframe ps and get back 5 mail message a directory listing 3 uuencoded part of bruce_tanner gif and the dodframe ps file in ascii oh wildcards be allow but a maximum of 20 mail message round up to the next whole file be send a  send dod   gif would send 150 file of 50k each not a good idea    bruce tanner 213 860 2451 x 596 tanner cerritos edu cerritos college norwalk ca cerritos tanner                                                            a couple of comment bruce have put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the rec moto photo archive useful second since bruce have provide the server a a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal work hour california time

 for discussion purpose i will ignore dynamic effect like pulse in the exhaust pipe and try to paint a useful mental picture 1  unless an engine be supercharge the pressure available to force air into the intake tract be _atmospheric_ at the time the intake valve be open the pressure differential available to move air be only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure left over after the exhaust stroke and atmospheric a the piston decends on the intake stroke combustion chamber pressure be decrease allow atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract at no time do the pressure ever become    negative    or even approach a good vacuum 2  at the time of the exhaust valve closing the pressure in the combustion chamber be essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction the muffler note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust be much large than the volume that must flow through the intake because of the temperature difference and the product of combustion 3  in the last 6 8 year the japanese manufacturer have start pay attention to exhaust and intake tune in pursuit of almighty horsepower at this point in time on high performance bike substitution of an aftermarket free flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance because the stock intake system flow very well anyway substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference unless in general the new exhaust system be _much_ louder than the stocker 4  on old bike exhaust back pressure be the dominate factor if free flowing air filter be substitute very little difference be note unless a free flowing exhaust system be instal a well 5  in general an engine can be visualize a an air pump at any give rpm anything that will cause the engine to pump more air be it on the intake or exhaust side will cause it to produce more horsepower pump more air will require recalibration rejetting of the carburetor

 if i remember correctly the reason that bmw  s come with those expensive and relatively worthless short live varda battery be  cause bmw own a control interest in that battery manufacturer what  s wrong with the bmw battery never have problem and i know numerous people that be still use the original battery in there 8 10 year old beemers the original battery in an 8 10 year old bmw may be fine mine last many year the replacement 30ah battery from bmw be a disaster the mechanic from comp acc told me that ca would warantee replace the bad one with a new one of the same evil bad battery and tell the customer if they have problem to bring it back and do it again it seem that many of those 30ah battery be doa near doa and always unlikely to be go strong by the end of the warantee period on them there be a big batch of bad one and they replace them with  you guess it more bad one bmw switch to a 25ah battery that have more cold crank amp even if it have less total juice i switch to a yuasa that have even more cold crank amp and cost one third few dollar

 three actually i believe i discuss countersteering a horse before basically there be two way to steer a horse plow rein and neck rein plow reining steer him by keep the rein separate and you pull in the direction you wish to go neck reining steer a horse by hold the rein together in one hand and pull against the horse  s neck in the direction you wish to go when training a plow steering horse to neck rein one technique be to cross the rein under his neck thus when neck reining to the left the right rein pull against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit which the horse be use to from his plow reining day be you sorry you ask yet

 my old jacket be about to bite the dust so in the market for a new rid jacket look for recommendation for a suitable replacement i would like to buy a full aerostich suit but i afford 700 for it right now consider two basic option 1 buy the aerostich jacket only dunno how much it cost due to recent price increase but imagine over 400 that may be push my limit advantage include the fact that i can later add the pant and that it nearly eliminates the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit 2 buy some kind of leather jacket i like a few of the new hein gericke firstgear line however they may be a bit pricey unless i can work some sort of deal advantage of leather be potentially slightly well protection enhance pose value we all know how important that be possibly cheaper than upper aerostich requirement for a jacket be that it must fit over a few other layer mainly a size thing if leather prefer a zip out line it must have some body armor similar to aerostich elbow shoulder forearm possibly back kidney protection etc a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice ventilation would be a plus however it must be wearable in cold weather below freeze with layer or perhaps electric please fire away with suggestion comment etc     steve

 imho in my humble opinion i say there be no value all i say be that it be very confuse to newbie bill you be kid yourself here firstly motorcycle do not steer themselves only the rider can do that secondly it be the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacle and not the knowledge of physic between the rider  s ear be you seriously suggest that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competently than you could manage otherwise formal training in this country a far a i be aware do not include countersteering theory i found out about countersteering about six year ago from a physic lecturer who be also a motorcyclist i believe him at first when he say i steer my bike to the right to make it turn left but i go out and analyse closely what i be do and realize he be right an interest bit of knowledge and have a lot of fun since then tell others about it who be at first a sceptical a i be but all it be an interest bit of knowledge and to claim that it be essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or well a a result be absurd formal training be in my view absolutely essential if go to be able to ride a bike properly and safely but by include countersteering theory in newbie course we be confuse people unnecessarily right at the time when there be  far  more important matter for them to learn and that be my original point

 on a waterski bike you turn the handlebar left to lean right just like on a motorcycle so this support the move the contact patch from beneath the centre of mass theory on how to  lean  this contradicts the need for gyroscopic precession to have a countersteering induced  lean       for a waterski bike it contradicts nothing for a motorcycle not only that but this morning i saw a tv ad for a waterski bike a sea doo for those who care i watch the lengthy ad very carefully and in every case and at every speed the rider turn the handlebar left to go left and right to go right in other word they be  not  countersteering so perhaps it be only  some  waterski bike on which one countersteers

 a you point out the experiment would be difficult but we know enough about the physic of the situation to do some calculation there be in fact three effect contribute to lean the bike over to begin a turn 1  gyro effect cause a torque which twist the bike over 2  contact patch have shift to one side cause bike to fall over 3  contact patch be accelerate to the side cause a torque which twist the bike over take an average bike rider average bike wheel and at speed of 5 15 and 50 mph say calculate how much twist of the bar would be need to produce say 20 degree of lean in say 2 second by each effect alone my guess be that at slow speed 2 be dominant and at high speed 3 be dominant and at all speed 1 contributes not far off bugger all relatively speak by the way a similar problem be this how do a runner who want to run round a corner get lean into the corner fast be there a run group where we could start    counter footing    argument and have them all fall over a they try to work out how they go round corner

 normal for the bmw k bike to use a little oil in the first few thousand mile i know why have three new k bike and all three use a bit of oil when new max maybe  4 quart in first 1000 mile this soon quits and by the time i have 10 000 mile on them the oil consumption be about zero be told that the harder you run the bike within reason the sooner it stop use any oil
 also if they get it exactly right or your eye change again contact to correct for it be out of the question this be due to the strange conical shape your cornea take after the surgery    michael man mmanning icomsim com nextmail accepted
 absurd that statement must therefore say that any argument in favor of seatbelt or airbags be an argument against automobile any argument for lifeguard be an argument against swim it say that any agrgument in favor of safety precaution be an argument for ban the activity to which the precaution apply extrapolate to that degree be ridiculous there be any normal human activity left to do therefore it be a non seqitur also even though most people do not ride motorcycle they do boat sail jetski climb ski fly parachute hang glide glide bungee jump bike skate rollerblade skateboard play rugby ouch mow the lawn rewire the basement operate heavy machinery and do a host of other  dangerous  thing that would all be a valid a motorcycle a activity to ban your little homily applies to all those thing and the general public buying into ban motorcycle without realize that their activity would be next be unlikely

 hi folk go to be buying my first bike and consider an 82 honda ascot ft500 with less than 5k mile do this sound like a reasonable choice be there anything special i need to know thanks
 mjs no no no no all i be say be that you even need to tell people mjs the technique of countersteering co they will do it intuitively the first mjs time they try to go round a corner karr be you sure remember that you  can  get around corner without karr countersteering in fact my experienced rider course instructor karr claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike karr turn to whichever side they want just by shift their weight karr around even when the operator be try to turn in the opposite karr direction i admit never actually see this experienced this back when i be young er and more foolish     my first bike use to track extremely true go down the highway i would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas steady slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest rid without any hand if i need to turn shift my weight into the turn and lo and behold the bike would turn sans touch the bar grant it turn very fast but it prof that you can turn a bike without countersteering at least not in term of the input to the bar normally associate with countersteering a say i know many people who think all you do be lean and any input give to the bar be totally unconscious whereas that may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstance possibly for year at a stretch i think of anybody who  d argue that this be preferable to properly know how to manipulate the bar in a turn regardless of what you want to call it except maybe for mr  sixsmith     mr  bill

 well say mostly right but for different reason btw a of a couple year ago the most steal bike in orange county and sf be 750 gsx  s and ninja probably the big reason bmws ripped off be that most people who buy bmws will only deal with the actual bmw dealer or mail  order type most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law enforcement type and their mark up be usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquire part for harleys and rice rockets get 2 different situation there be a huge aftermarket in harley part so a bike can be part out fairly easily ditto the non sport japanese bike but the price on the part for these be not a high comparatively for the  rockets anytime a bike go down the plastic be usually crack and be expensive to replace fairly easy then for a disreputable shop to take a fair from a steal bike slap it on a bike in for repair repaint it and make a tidy profit the other part more traceable can be use or discard if they be too traceable mike

 tough question    more dangerous than drive a car and far more dangerous if you apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity basically stupidity will get you hurt killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car but with care it be not unreasonably dangerous also buying good protective clothing be helpful that way if something do go wrong you be likely to be less severely injured first thing if possible take a msf driver training course this will get you start on the right foot    they teach control of the vehicle and safe rid practice second buy protective gear at minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather glove be a must a good sturdy piece of footgear be also very helpful though leather hike boot a pair of old army boot or something similar work fine for this purpose a long a you make sure the lace stay tie after those a leather jacket and leather pant or chap be nice a well but these be also expensive item for the pant many people consider a good pair of jean to be reasonable preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight similarly for a jacket a good jean jacket be a reasonable compromise though more people tend to have leather jacket around than pant another thing to do be drop in on garage sale look for a second hand leather jacket look for a fairly thick leather in these item third do anything stupid    ride after drinking even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance ride in the snow or when condition be such that black ice be likely be very careful rid in the rain    slow way down take corner gingerly brake early and gently try not to ride if you be sick tire take any medication with drowsiness warning or otherwise not in average shape with care you should be ok  i would suggest mid to late 80  s japanese mid sized standard something in 400 650 cc range would probably be reasonable if you be shorter lighter than average you might want to go a low a a 300 400 cc bike possible model the suzuki g series eg gs500 gs650 etc  these be generally inline 4 bike generally dependable except for a tendency to weakness in the charge system stator and or regulator rectifier problem my first bike be a about  82 gs650 it server me well the honda nighthawk series this may also be know a the cb series i think eg honda cb450 cb650 etc this be another series of standard motorcycle also fairly dependable kawasaki and yamaha probably have similar bike but i know them a well for mid to late  80s model of the above you should be able to buy the bike for under 2000 leave you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing cost
 i hate to admit this but there do seem to be some sort of twist logic to this approach the bikers against the world and the dog be just another worthless adversary so remember to wear at least calf height leather boot in case the dog get lucky and sink his teeth into your attack foot and go for the gusto if that dog retreat from the street with his tail between his leg next time you see it then you really do your bit for all your fellow bikers sorry i go this far a dog against and armored cage just seem like a fair fight after all it be a dog eat dog world
 not that logic have anything to do with it but     i can see the liability of put sticker on the car while it be move or something but the bdi that chooses to start and then drive the car in a know unsafe condition that would seem to be liable furthermore they would have have the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation which be an additional factor in attribute    blame    anyway sticker on the window be less effective     no one have any problem take a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker but a different story with that that nice paint job on the door      jeff

 splitfires work mainly by provide a more or less unshrouded spark to the combustion chamber if an engine  s cylinder head design can benefit from this then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase most noticeably in low rpm range torque splitfires do diddly squat for my 1992 gmc pickup 4 3l v6 but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 harley sportster 1200 and my best friend  s 1986 sportster 883  folk i know who ve try them in 1340 evo motor tell any performance boost over plain plug which be interest since the xlh and big twin evo combustion chamber be pretty much the same shape just different size two of my friend who have shovelhead harleys swear by the splitfires but if i have a shovelhead dual plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plug to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head

 several year ago while drive a cage a dog dart out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there be enough distance between u so i have to slow down however a 2nd dog suddenly appear and collide with my right front bumper and the force of the impact be enough to kill that scottish terrier apparently it be follow the 1st dog henceforth if a dog decides to cross the street keep an eye out for a 2nd dog a many dog like to travel in pair or pack yet to experience a dog chase me on my black gl1200i which have a pretty loud oem horn not a good a fiamms but good enuff but the bike be large and heavy enough to run right over one of the small nipper while the large one would have trouble get my leg between the saddlebag and engine guard def feel more vulnerable on my  68 trump a that  d be easy leg chew target for those mongrel if there  s a persistent dog run after bikers despite complaint to the owner i be adverse to run over it with my truck a a dog life worth much imho compare to a child rid a bike who get knock to the ground by say dog and dy from a head injury any dog in the neighborhood vicious or a public menace run about unleashed be fair game a road kill candidate
 okay dod ers here  s a goddamn mystery for ya today i be turn a 90 degree corner just like on any other day but there be a slight difference  a rough spot right in my path cause the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible    thunk    i pull over at first opportunity to sus out the damage my bike be a kawasaki gpx250r with footpegs that be hinge and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc  and on the low extreme corner of each peg there be mount a    bank follower    or a little stud that theoretically be the first bit to hit the ground in a 100  banked turn the stud be mount on the footpeg by a thread bit about 7 mm long which screw into a thread hole in the footpeg now for the mystery the stud on the side of the bike that clunked when i turn be absent fairly sure it be there before the event there be no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have be in fact the thread in the hole in the footpeg be perfectly intact with no evidence of something have be forcefully ripped out of it only moment previously okay all you engineering type how the f  k do you explain this how can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a thread hole in alloy without damage the thread in the hole be this some sort of hi tech design thingo that kawasaki never mention like that the end of the footpeg suddenly change phase on impact to let the stud rip out then change back to a solid quite amaze at how this could have happen in the meantime life go on without a left hand bank follower

  cough   choke  what if a cop give me a ticket for    sound    like i be speed probably show up in court without a lawyer simply because    sound    like speed be ridiculous if i be found guilty appeal and then show up with a lawyer if a cop do one of vascar from car or plane radar lidar other electronic speed measure device pace me and within 15mph or so of the limit go to court i can accept a cop    see    me go excessively fast like 25  over the limit but    he look like he be go 70 or so in a 55 zone    be not    beyond a reasonable doubt    grant i may well lose the case but 70 in a 55 measure by eye take it to court for sure
  i know of no law either on the book or propose that ban motorcycle  from any place that i want to go to many private place ban bike for example the famous 17 mile drive at the monterrey peninsula and i have stayed at resort that sport a    no motorcycle allow    sign at the entrance and there have be public place call the ama and ask for jim bensberg sp or any one else in their legislative office they will recound the many public place that they have to bring to court to reverse their ban on bike that include everything from public park to full city there be probably a few fight on their book a we now speak that be another good reason to donate to their legislative fund ____________________________________________________________________________ death be life  s way of tell you be fire    r  geis

 while i agree with you on that formal training be essential for safe rid i disagree strongly with your original point the point of formal training must be to prepare rider for the road preparedness be in my opinion to know a much a possible so to exclude some aspect of rid a bike in a course be wrong imho now to countersteering in particular countersteering be something that must be train a common reaction among new bikers or bicycle rider in an emergency situation be to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle a we know this make the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what be intend needle to say this be dangerous i have a specific example a rider in a left turn the rider think he she be to close to the right shoulder of the road and try to steer the motorcycle to the left by pull the left handle and push the right handle the motorcycle straightens up and go off the road a bad scenario the same rider same turn in the middle of the turn the rider see a truck come towards him her the panic rider try to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crash right into it the main function of a rid course be to teach how to avoid emergency situation and what to do if in one thus the knowledge and training of countersteering be imho a must in any rid course

 mjs secondly it be the adhesion of the mjs tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the mjs motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacle and mjs not the knowledge of physic between the rider  s ear be you seriously                      mjs suggest that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster mjs or more competently than you could manage otherwise ed if not i will hey ed you give me the chance sheesh the answer be absolutely a ed so eloquently describes ed put two rider on identical machine the ed one who know what do and why that will be faster it  may  ed be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it be ed through trial and error but it be not very effective methodology ed only by understand the technique of steer a motorcycle can one                       ed improve on that technique i hold that this applies to any human ed endeavor herein lie the key to this thread kindly note the difference in the response ed and i be talk about know rid technique while mike be argue know the physic behind it it  is  possible to be taught the technique of countersteering ie push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way  without  have to learn all the fizziks about gyroscope and ice cream cone and such a see in the parallel thread that stuff be mainly of interest to techno motorcycle geek like the reader of rec motorcycles but need to be taught to the average student learn c steering mike seem to be able to make the distinction i know people who can carve circle around me who tell you who newton be on the other hand i know very intelligent well educated people who think that you steer a motorcycle by either 1 lean 2 steer a la bicycle or 3 a combination of 1 and 2  knowledge of physic get you squat knowledge of technique do

 hey pal who  re you call litte tony
 include all the one who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner agree this be really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree i still think that tell newbie to steer left to turn to the right be unnecessarily confuse when do it anyway if they just get on the bike and ride the damn thing me too jeez ed when you start talk about traction management policy i thought you be make some weird reference to look after railway locomotive     the official line here though i do have my doubt about it be that the front brake be apply first follow by the rear brake the idea be that you avoid lock up the rear after weight transfer take place in practice i suspect most people do what you describe if you slide the tyre you have no way of know whether achieve maximum brake or not not suggest that you should always aim to brake a hard a you possibly can but if you want to find the limit of the machine you have to go beyond them

 yo whaz up earlier i be reading on the net about use splitfire plug one guy be think about it and almost everybody shot him to hell well i saw one think that someone say about    show me a team that use split  fire        well here  s some additional insight and some theory about splitfire plug and how they boost u a oppossed to cage splitfires be originally make to burn fuel more efficiently and increase power for the 4x4 cage well for these guy splitfires increase performance by increase torque they focus on horsepower number now how do this related to u high performance pilot well that depends do you pilot a high performance 2  or 4 cylinder machine in the case of 4 cylinders splitfires would increase overall torque but 4  s make more top end horsepower with it torque packed down low so for 4  s splitfires would not significantly increase power but what about twin     many of you 4 guy laugh at some of u twin but many time we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss see doug polen vs  scott russell daytona 1992 however twin make more torque thoughout their powerbands so how do this translate increase torque should    theoretically    help twin make more power splitfire claim that there should be not extra mod or anything make just stick  em in now i know about all of this and try to catch up with somebody about it now but splitfires should help twin more than 4  s a far a race team     ducati team    fast by ferraci    use splitfires in the 1989 season this be when they have jamie james run for em but i know why they stop since then also somebody check to see if they have them in 88        peace warren wcd82671 uxa cso uiuc edu    have suzuki will travel        at a local    fix er up er    shop the bike repairest look at a dumped zx 7 then he ask the guy        what happen           i dumped the clutch           how fast           pretty fast           insurance           nope    the fixer smile

 some will and others will steer with their tuchuses i know how much the teach of countersteering in the beginner course really help the tuchus steerer i be one i guess that i always steer a bicycle that way and i only get the hang of countersteering in normal rid  after  the course i could do the countersteering swerve in the course no problem but i only start use it in my normal rid when i decide that my turn at speed off ramps and the like be a lot more difficult that it should have be i knew how it work although currently up for debate definitely knew  that  it work a i could do it in swerve but only figure it out later in my normal rid just a data point i think that not a bad idea to bring the idea up but best to let everyone tuchus steer for the first lesson or two so they can learn to shift gear before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique i have in our beginner course we have passenger training sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student would take him for a ride if the student do not give the instructor the    you be a sack of potato    passenger speech the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself it be amuse to watch just happy that it happen to me

 sheesh even a train attack dog be no match for a human we have  all  the advantage i agree with this 100 after all when you grab under his chin and be careful to keep your hand away from his twist head what be he go to do    tailwag you to death i even have one occasion where i be unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb german shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his low jaw in the other now hold his mouth open no way be he strong enough to clamp down and he can do nothing however all this macho shit aside the fact be that when you be rid a bike and a dog be arrowing to intercept it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog for the simple fact that it might be through your leather and work on your jean before you can dismount and deal with it properly by all mean if you do kick the dog or otherwise get it attention stop and stay there if you kick the dog and ride away that be a victory for the dog    it drove you out of it territory it be not even a qualify victory it be a victory if you kick it and stop and sit there 99 of dog will say    oh shit this guy  s serious    and back off now you have establish your dominance over the dog and it probably will not bother you again llama however be a different story if you stop near a llama it will just hop on and insist on a ride and if lucky if it like you it  ll barf you off the bike and steal it
 i need some advice on have someone ride pillion with me on my 750 ninja this will be the the first time take anyone for an extend ride read farther than around the block be rid some twisty fairly bumpy road the mine road mt hamilton loop for you sf bay areans say this be a very bad idea you should start out with something much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head that particular road require full concentration not the sort of thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time once you both decide that you like rid together and want to do something longer and more challenge  then  go for a hard core road like mines mt hamilton in any case  your  moral responsibility to make sure that she have proper gear that fit especially if go sport rid
 my rule of thumb be    give ride to people that wear a big helmet than you    unless your taste run that way or they be family friends gee reminds me of a  dancer  in hull just over the river from ottowa that i saw a few year ago for her i would a bought a big helmet or even her own bike or anything else she want
 it be certainly possible and quite easy in most case especially on two strokes very common to do this on bike where the cylinder mounting through studs prevent the cylinder from be remove with the engine in the frame i do this when i assemble the top end on my indian which be easy yet because it do not have through studs base flange stud and separate head bolt dontchaknow you have to use a little foresight rag duct tape etc to keep clip from fall in clothespin hoseclamps etc to support the cylinder while insert the pin be these call gudgeon pin in the uk if so what  s a gudgeon
 if he have a history of such thing why be it not mention in the article and why do they present the irrelevant detail of where he get his drinking money from i say exactly who be at fault here but from where i sit be look like see the result either of the law go way out of hand or of shoddy journalism if the law want to attach string to how you spend a settlement they should put the money in trust they so i would assume perfectly legitimate to drink it away though i spend it that way myself

 a biker and a dog lover first and foremost i want to mention some common sense if a choice between injuring killing a dog or get yourself injured killed there be only one rational decision only the most insane animal right kook would put the dog first second useful to learn how to read a dog  s body language how you react to a dog who be chase you because he think a game and that play with him be completely different from how you react to a dog which have hostile intent third useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog dog be social beast and recognize a domination submission hierarchy to a dog there be two type of fellow creatures that which he dominates and that which dominate him you need to unambiguously represent yourself a be of the latter class you be god you be easily angered and your anger be terrible but god be also amuse by one who properly submits to his dominance and may even on rare occasion dispense a kind word a kind word or even oh joy oh rapture unforeseen a dog bisquit now how do that all relate to biking well first a good idea to assume that most dog who chase motorcycle do so because they think a game and not out of overt hostility the msf suggestion be a very good one when you see the dog come slow down so he determines a particular place of interception just before you and he reach that spot punch the throttle so that when he reach it already long go dog take a few second to react to new input and definitely can not comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle be capable of with a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter strong measure may be necessary this be the face off first    and there be very important    make sure you never face off a dog on his territory face him off on the road not on his driveway if necessary have a large stick roll up newspaper etc something the beast will understand be something that will hurt him stand your ground then slowly advance your mental attitude be that you be very angry and be go to dispense terrible punishment the large the dog the great your anger dog will pick up anger just a they can pick up fear and since you and he be not on his home territory it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he be on your territory and that you be prepared to fight to the death most dog will decide that it be a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there be at least a home advantage also observe that you be satisfied by that retreat gesture of submission and thus they have escape punishment

 you and the beav should lighten up esp the beav i agree that dui dwi be serious we should have reasonable law strict enforcement and tough sentence but andrew do not post    look for sympathy over the consequence    he post ask for advice because he have an extremely high quote his post be obviously valid because he later found insurance for less he note why he be in his predicament but do not defend in any way drunk drive and have renounce drunk drive there be too many repeat offender to worry about and other bdc why try to make this person who be no longer part of the problem an outcast he have paid his debt to society step off the high horse we have all be irresponsible in the past with that say guilty of the same type of hostility towards rapist i think it come because i feel the punishment be not severe enough the same may be true of dwi dui if that be the case then it be our stinkin gubment we need to change if we have a reasonable law about dwi dui with a stiff penalty then few people would do it at any rate andrew a paid his debt a define by the law if you think that debt be actually great than the law mandate tell your  representatives jack water ii dod 1919

 ok a one last attempt i  ll take a different tack we all seem to be in agreement that there be two explanation for why one can use the handlebar to lean a move motorcycle the question be be one of the effect dominant and which one be it the idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristic and see which effect produce a similar result to the one with which those of u who have bike be familiar let  s look at the one that so far have spark no controversy on it own gyroscopic precession to examine this alone we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect by not allow the contact patch to transmit any force the wheel and steer mechanism would have to remain and be attach to a vehicle with about the same weight a a bike through suspension so that the wheel transmit force to the bike the same way similar to a bike an experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get move and to get the wheel spin then change surface to something that transmit force through the contact patch and try a steer manoeuvre to see if the bike lean it probably would since some of u know how easy it be to fall down on ice but we get a good idea of how well or what it feel like because without the contact patch we turn maybe there  s a well way besides even ice get rid of the contact patch force altogether so have to find a really frictionless surface have to try it again with the wheel lock to really know if it be the rotation that do it look at the contact patch effect only however be fairly simple now we have to find a vehicle that get the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch force a a motorcycle and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle but without rotate wheel how it get the contact patch force be irrelevant just look for something that have contact patch that can go straight and not sideways and ski or skate would do fine i know of any snow ski or skate bike but up here we have the suzuki wetbike that be arrange like a motorcycle but have fat water ski where there should be wheel i think the propellor be in front of the rear ski or something like that but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of it effect now i admit that this be second hand info although love to try one of these but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sell them both say that this machine handle very much like a motorcycle in that you countersteer it to turn so we have contact patch that transmit similar force to a bike  s a similar suspension arrangement and no gyroscope but we do have countersteering conclusion you need gyroscope to countersteer vehicle that have motorcycle like contact patch arrangement we still know what real effect the gyroscope have when there but from my observation of how handlebar angle force etc relate to steer in general willing to bet that not the dominant factor in countersteering if you like this conclusion then accept it but my motorcycle s behaviour be consistent with it if someone can prove otherwise go ahead

 so it look like go to have to put a couple of bike in storage for a few month start several month from now and already contemplate how to do it so a easy to get go again a possible i have everything under control i think besides the battery i know that if i buy a 50 00 battery tender for each one and leave them plug in the whole time the bike be in storage be fine but not sure necessary never heard anyone discuss this idea so maybe there  s some reason why it so great but maybe someone can tell me would it be a mistake to fully charge the battery drain the electrolyte into separate container one for each battery seal the container close up the battery and leave them that way then it would seem that when the bike come out of storage i could put the electrolyte back in the battery and they should still be fully charge what  s wrong with this on a related but different note for you bay area denizen there someone who have a bunch of spare edta a few month back who be it be there still any of it left thanks for any and all help

 well i use to get mad and either try to communicate my anger to jerk or to uhm educate them in how to improve their manner in traffic now i just try to get them off my tail in heavy traffic i slow down a bit mostly so i have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind but i also often find that the jerk behind will notice traffic move faster in other lane switch into one of them and pas me which be fine because then i can keep a well eye on the jerk from behind while look ahead rather than from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirror in traffic so heavy that there be no way for the jerk to pas i might pull over a if to look for a street number or name still ignore the jerk just to get the jerk off my tail if this all sound well wimpy or un denizenly or pessimistic or perhaps for any psych type passive aggressive consider that i prefer to get my adrenaline jolly from rid rather than from yell at jerk a ride can improve my whole day while yell at a jerk be likely for me to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger in the bad case yell at the jerk could ruin my life since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me be well arm with the cage than i be on a bike on the other hand you might try subtly arrange to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersection leave the jerk wait for cross traffic and thus off your tail or cross illegally hopefully in front of the wait police like almost everything here your choice and mileage will vary

 for those of you who be think about fiamms you might also want to think about airhorns i just instal a set of bosch air horn order from dennis kirk pg 282 of the late catalog on my  85 fj1100 they be rat at 93db at 7 meter i instal them use 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground my stock horn connector fit the relay pin just fine i solder the connection to the relay and compressor and use a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse connector from napa i instal the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fair by tie wrap between the steer head frame and the black steel tube frame use to support the front fair you have to remove the front fair to do this but it fit outside of the frame but inside the fair on the two vertical support just in front of the fuse depend how tight your fair follow the frame you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fair the compressor be about 2    in diameter and about 5    long the relay mount on the front of the steer head frame it be small so there should be plenty of good place for it i found a perfect place for the horn that require only tie wrap to mount the horn fit inside the front fairing frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoop but behind the turn signal the back of the horn point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame there be just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance and there be nice cut out in the frame for the back of the horn to go into the short horn be even with the fair and the long one stick out about an inch or so but it be really not that noticable unless you look closely they end up point down slightly and maybe 30 degree from straight ahead perfect for those cager try to change lane into you if you have any other question about the mount email and i can try to explain well if your bike be not red then you may want to paint them first how do they work you ask they be very very very  loud  they sound more like a european sport car than a truck but a vast improvement over stock i have use them at least daily since instal them and the 10 amp fuse have not blown yet although the duration of the horn blast have be short repeatedly scar the shit out of my friend with them even though they know that i have the horn they still jump they be perfect for keep the pedestrian on the sidewalk the bottom line be they work be loud enough to cause pain and suffer to those stupid lane change cage a well a take a few year off their life and be relatively easy to install on the fj ymmv

 i  ll see your 3 and raise you 4
 i  ll tell you my story a an example of what  not  to do early in 1984 i take some rid lesson from my college roommate on his old honda cb360t he have take the msf beginner  s course so i actually learn  some  of what i need to know to ride i proceed to buy a beat up honda cl350 for 400 and a 12 helmet and rode around wear this and a cotton windbreaker then i decide to invest in a full face helmet first smart move sometime around then i also pass my road test on may 4 1984 i get caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4 mile trip enter the town where i live a rather urban suburb i have to stop suddenly for a red light that i notice too late skid the rear tire out and be eject face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic fortunately for me the oncoming traffic be also stop for the same red light otherwise i might have slid under a car and be kill now this be anecdotal evidence to be sure but i later take the experienced rider course from the msf and saw that earlier training could have help me greatly in your case the need be even great since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff a i do so my advice be to take the msf beginner  s course first thing i even buy a bike until take the course unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until ready to use it while wait to take the course it might take a few week in dc a i recall there be always wait list in boston could you save up some more money to start out right say 300 for rid gear plus the cost bike plus maybe 100 guess to a mechanic to make sure the machine be safe assume you economize by buying some old beat up machine from a private individual plus insurance plus registration and licensing fee plus the course look at maybe 600 not include the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance i pay about 100 insurance now upstate ny but it be closer to 200 in boston more urban for decent insurance include substantial coverage for liability which you want unless you plan always to be poor guess dc be more like boston than like a rural area ergo more expensive there use to be annual buyer  s guide in the usual motorcycle magazine i found those helpful in get an idea of what new or recent model might be available you could probably look through past issue to size up what use bike might be available my first bike be 13 year old when i bought it so i go on my friend  s advice instead also look at the bike that you see people rid or that be park on the street i basically settle on my present bike by notice that there be a lot of high mileage bmw  s run around and they be generally set up the way i want nothing wrong with talk to various dealer in your area or visit showroom dealer in the boston area at least when i be shopping be very nice about let you look around their showroom and quote price for bike that the late model hence cheaper although i end up buying both bike in private sale
 i want to let people know that this motorcycle have be sell thanks for your inquiry

         never like my passenger to try and shift their weight with the turn at all     i find the weight shift can be very sudden and unnerve one thing if just get comfortable or decide to look over your other shoulder but i recommend have him her shift her weight with each turn     too violent also i think someone already say this make sure your passenger wear good gear i sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or lack other safety gear depends on how squidly i feel but i let passenger do it what i do to myself i can handle but i want to hurt anyone else so i let them on without glove jacket at least jean heavy boot and a helmet that  fits  go  real  easy amaze how solid a grip you have on the handle bar that your passenger do not make her feel like s go to slide off the back and    snappy    turn for you be sicken lurch for her in general it feel much less control and smooth a a passenger i stand be on the back of my brother  s bike and i ride aggressively when i ride and i know a good pilot     still everything feel very unsteady when a passenger show off by not show off the first time out
 if not i will put two rider on identical machine the one who know what do and why that will be faster it  may  be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it be through trial and error but it be not very effective methodology only by understand the technique of steer a motorcycle can one improve on that technique i hold that this applies to any human endeavor do you consider an understand of the physic of traction absurd be you seriously suggest that one can form a traction management policy without understand what it be or what factor increase or decrease available traction brake it be highly unlikely that any biker be go to develop his maximum swerve ability without any knowledge of turn technique for most of his rid life this may not be a problem but in an emergency situation it be very definately place him at a disadvantage i disagree the existance and immense success of rid course which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that be neither confuse nor detracts from any other aspect of the course perhaps but in the ensue discussion you strayed far from that point to claim that knowledge of steer technique be irrelevant to a rider  s ability i find this assertion ludicrous
