 some one ask me recently why they when they use xquerybestcursor to see if they could create of a give size it seem to imply they could but the server do not create cursor of that size investigation show that some x server will happily return any size up to the size of the root window while others return some fix limit of more reasonable size the interest thing to me be that the same server binary act differently on different hardware a sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursor up to root window size be ok while a sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32 so far also see this behavior on ncd and phase x x terminal and have be told it also occurs on hp actually the ncd be even more liberal size much large then the root winodw be gladly return a ok  be xquerybestcursor semi broken or be this behavior correct really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor

 well yes and no i particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate but i do think worth point out that    popular usage    be not always sufficient excuse in this case for example i think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper name if people commonly misspell or mispronounce your name would you feel compel to change it probably not the same be true of x    the x window system       x       x11    and related monickers be proper name in the same sense that any product name be a proper name in fact some of them be  trademarked  name the fact that many people get them wrong be largely beside the point a for the trade publication that promulgate thing like    x window    or    x windows    or any of the other nonsensical variant one often see consider the fact that these publication be supposedly write by  journalists  would you trust the fact of a journalist who be bother to get the name of his her source right would you trust a product review by someone who get the name of the product wrong popular usage be a it may be but i for one be all for hold people who claim to be journalist to a high standard of correctness

 from article 1993apr17 010256 14372 eafs000 ca boeing com by ten0772 eafs000 ca boeing com timothy e  neto this all sound suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this background first megatek have a series of framebuffers design a x accelerator for the most part these be design for sun sbus and sun and other vendor  s vme system that say megatek product support multi screen and or multi display on a sigle workstation most of our card have a keyboard mouse port which can be use to provide additional display for example say you hade a sparcstation with an sbus expansion chassis you could put in six frambuffers allow a total of six screen in the system you could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard mice allow you to mix and match any combination of screen and display you could have 1 6 screen display 3 2 screen display 6 1 screen display or 1 2 screen display and 1 4 screen display basically any combination because of this we at megatek try to be very careful about the use of the word multi screen and multi display they be quite different in meaning and at least in x have exact definition the reason i ramble like this be the mention of an upper limit if 12 screen in a display a it so happens there  s a define in the server that determines the most screen support server include misc h maxscreens a release my mit this be 3  a release by megatek this be 12  a such the most screen support by a single megatek display i e x server be 12  if someone construe this to be a limitation of x sorry but clearly a point out so well by mr  neto this be not the case we just do it here because nobody have ever ask u for more of course i could say    buy all you want support more

from a signal handler no xlib and xt have no mutual exclusion for protect critical section if your signal handler make such a call at the wrong time which might be while the function you be call be already execute it can leave the library in an inconsistent state note that the ansi c standard point out that behavior of a signal handler be undefined if the signal handler call any function other than signal itself so this be not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mention other function which may be call safely but it may not be assume that these function be call by xlib or xt function you can work around the problem by set a flag in the interrupt handler and later check it with a work procedure or a timer event which have previously be add note the article in the x

other file descriptor but which operates efficiently and without block on either the x connection or the other file descriptor a solution be use xtappaddinput after you open your file descriptor use xtappaddinput to register an input handler the input handler will be call every time there be something on the file descriptor require your program  s attention write the input handler like you would any other xt callback so it do it work quickly and return it be important to use only non blocking i o system call in your input handler most input handler read the file descriptor although you can have an input handler write or handle exception condition if you wish be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file you will find that the function be call even when there input pending xtappaddinput be actually work a it be suppose to the input handler be call whenever the file descriptor be ready to be read not only when there be new data to be read a disk file unlike a pipe or socket be almost always ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the begin and read data read before the result be that your function will almost always be call every time around xtappmainloop there be a way to get the type of interaction you be expect add this line to the begin of your function to test whether there be new data if ioctl fd fionread n     1    n    0 return but because this be call frequently your application be effectively in a busy wait you may be well off not use xtappaddinput and instead set a timer and in the timer procedure check the file

 mostly  transparent you have several choice the shape extension first release with x11r4 offer an easy way to make non rectangular window so you can set the shape of the window to fit the area where the window should be nontransparent however not all server support the extension a machine specific method of implement transparent window for particular server be to use an overlay plane support by the hardware note that there be no x notion of a    transparent color index    a generally portable solution be to use a large number of tiny window but this make operating on the application a a unit difficult a final answer be to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with be able to overlay your application window with information if so you can draw

may expect that draw with a value of black on a background of black for example should produce white however the draw operation do not work on rgb value but on colormap index the color that the result colormap index actually point to be undefined and visually random unless you have actually fill it in yourself on many x server black and white often 0 1 or 1 0 program take advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break if you want to be combine color with gxxor then you should be allocate a number of your own color cell and fill them with your chosen pre computed value if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two color then you can take the shortcut of set the background color in the gc graphic context to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draw over red say the result be blue and when it draw over blue the result be red this foreground value be itself the xor of the colormap index of red and blue thanks to chris flatters cflatter zia aoc

know the id can manipulate the resource almost any x server resource except for gc and private color cell can be share the problem you face be how to disseminate the window id to multiple application a simple way to handle this and which solves the problem of the application run on different machine be in the first application to create a specially named property on the root window and put the window id into it the second application then retrieves the property whose name it also know and then can draw whatever it want into the window note this scheme work iff there be only one instance of the first application run and the scheme be subject to the limitation mention in the question about use window id on remote display note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher level cooperation among your application note also that two process can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection if one process be a child of the other it should close down the

 i have two question well probably more     about how expose configure event be handle i have an appl which us 1 window to draw in since i give the user the capability of scale and zoom a well a allow the window to be resize i make a translation table for the expose configure event the expose event call my redraw method while the configure event call my rescale method the rescale method invokes a    fake    expose event actually just call the redraw w  an appropriate expose struct to draw the data quest 1  when the appl be compiled linked w  r4 run in either r4 or r5 env i get multiple 4 redraws when the window get uncovered or the size be change i assume get cascade event be that right any suggestion a to how to handle trap event in a well way quest 2  when the appl be compiled linked w  r5 i get no expose event whatsoever do event and or translation table act differently in r5 thanks in advance steve
 almost all window manager twm mwm olwm and their derivates support escape sequence for it for your purpose put follow into your  login if use csh or tcsh for sh you have to modify it if    term          xterm    then echo    2 logname host  g  1 host  g    endif note stand for esc in vi you can enter it by press ctrl v and the esc same for  g it mean ctrl g  in vi press ctrl v and then ctrl g  the first sequence put the string into the title bar the second in the icon btw you can also put the current work directory in the title bar if you make an alias for cd alias cd  cd echo    2 logname host cwd  g    greeting thomas

 this design will work but i think it can take easily take advantage of expose event redraw optimization that be the whole window will be redrawn not just the area with the new item

 i have the follow problem on x11r5 server when a window of my be obscure by a pop up window which have the save under attribute set the subwindows of my window be not restore normally the subwindows be redrawn when the parent window get an expose event but because the save under attribute be use for the pop up window that obscure my window no expose event be sent when exposuremask be set for the child window those window be correctly update when the popup window disappears however then the application get too many expose event and you see extra redraws everything work fine with x11r4 be this something that be change between x11r4 and x11r5 obvious be it something i do wrong be there something that the popup window should do which be also mine be this a bug in x11 release 5 greeting
 i have the same problem i have look at motif   wwl interview gina   and a few variation on the above also do a cursory examination of rogue wave  s view h   i like view h    s abstraction best of all of the toolkits i mention but the result code look little like motif and i have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code gina   allows you to write code which look a great deal like motif and also make interest use of inheritance but the result code be almost too motif like and be certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent c code interview look promising but i found a free version with motif support and not confident how widely interview with motif support will be adopt and what if any specific motif support will be available over time the other library produce code which be less motif like but which do not make sufficient use of the feature of c   to simplify my cod task at this point my inclination be to write my motif manipulation routine in c and invoke those routine from my c   code use simple abstraction suit to my specific task later if osf or some credible standards setting body come up with a c   interface to motif i will change to that it do me no goo to write in c   if my choice of interface leaf me with code which leaf me tie to an abstraction which be not consistent with the industry direction well to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skill a few year from now views h   be the only library consider right now but in our environment end up spending nearly 5000 to use it and i justify it when likely to cause short term productivity decrease a we learn the new abstraction and be unlikely to be a sufficiently long lived solution for u to reap the benefit at the high end of the j curve brad

 i ran in to this problem i while ago and from what i remember you should use xttranslatecoordinates etc after realize the main widget to calculate the location of the popup then use something like xtvasetvalues on the popup widget before ever use them call setvalues repeatedly e g every time something pop up seem to be what slows you down i never delve deep enough to figure out exactly why though                                            jeremy payne uiuc neuroscience program college of medicine jrpayne uiuc edu 217 244 4478
 yes possible     in fact there  s some gl widget code in  usr lpp gl somewhere     name glib c my ibm  s down right now though so i find the exact location warn this code feel quite bogus it do thing like call noport before winopen and then extract an x window id from it anyway it work just fine under aix 3 1 i spent last weekend try to port it to 3 2 gl under 3 2 seem to like it and turn into a hard job check out your    info    page it have some pretty good documentation on whan you can and do when mix gl and x and how to go about do so

 there be several product you might investigate if get 20 000 per seat and high end hardware gain momentum might be a good choice it compatible with hypercard but have a similar architecture and  way  more functionality i have contact information but they be recently purchase by sybase who be too hard to find if run news on sparc check out hyperlook hyperlook turing com it us postscript a a script language which be good if you need to do lot of display orient script but not so good for non programmers it be 995 last i heard you might also look at our product metacard alpha testing direct import of hypercard stack even make the test release available for anonymous ftp so obviously the closest in functionality metacard run on most unix workstation and cost 495 email to info metacard com for more detail scott

 my question be this be there a mean of determine what the state of capslock and or numlock be alright ignore this i have delve a bit deeper xkeyevent and found what i be look for ev  state have a bunch of mask to check against lockmask be the one for capslock unfortunately it appear that the numlock mask varies from server to server how do one tell what mask be numlock and which be for meta mod1mask mod2mask mod3mask mod4mask mod5mask eg sgi  s vendor server have mod2mask be numlock whereas solaris 1 0 1 openwindows 3 0 have mod3mask for numlock be there an unambiguous mean of determine numlock  s mask at runtime for any give server sorry for the waste bandwidth and my appal ignorance have to check the keysym s on each of the key for each modifier the one with numlock in it mapping be the modifier you want a bit ugly perhaps but i think it currently the only way to do this and it do have some precedent a keysyms be use to differentiate capslock from shiftlock for the lock modifier i know of an accepted strategy for handle ambiguous assignment either ie what if numlock be mapped for more then one modifier i suppose first found be a good a any x handle lock modifier that well hope that help dave lapp
 i have notice in framemaker 3 1x on both the sgi and sun platform that certain dialog such a    column layout        for example respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer be not in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy be pointer how be this do i would like to emulate this behavior in my application it seem a reasonable behavior since when a dialog be popped up from a keyboard action the dialog be not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus alternatively open to any suggestion a to what be the    right    way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear particularly when they be invoked from the keyboard and one  s keyboard focus policy be pointer

 xmdrawingarea for draw with xlib but i would like to take advantage of the graphic library gl available on our ibm rs 6000 sgi  s gl i believe be it possible to mix x and gl in one application program can i use gl subroutine in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window open by me with xopenwindow you make gl call in an xmdrawingarea widget for sure there be a widget already define for gl it be the glxmdraw motif or glxdraw athena widget it be similar to a xmdrawingarea except that it allows you to use gl call to render into the window look at glxlink glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man page the glxmdraw widget work pretty well opengl will be an improvement i can vouch for that the gl widget work pretty well i have be use it for sometime now not sure though whether you can use xlib call to draw into the gl widget i try it yet nor have i read the accompany documentation completely try post to comp sys sgi for more information well still you will find most of the answer in the sgi manual    there be a little transition guide which explains the    mixed model program    paradigm mix x and gl do pex graphigs have the same functionality of gl i think gl be a little easy to use and a little more powerful but just an opinion mileage may vary well pex be design a an extension to x and will be more seamless but then it be buggy to start with    opinion again __ o_ o o  _ __ __  _
 we try to ship an x server once that only support a 24bit truecolor visual the main problem we encounter be 1 client write with logic like the follow if defaultdepth 1    assume default depth be 8bit    these client need an 8bit deep visual in the root window to run correctly 2 other client even bother to do that much and just outright assume they have a  dynamic  visual class with a dynamic colormap xstorecolors work on cmaps associate with static or truecolor visual class but many client bother to check they just start throw xstorecolor call at you though both be clearly client error this be the case with so many client that easy for you to expose 8bit pseudocolor a a default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client writer to change their client to do the right thing

 i be try to build and use imake x11r4 on an ibm rs 6000 run aix v3 2 i be have the follow 2 problem 1 many of my imakefile  s have contructs like      this be a makefile at the start of line to pas makefile comment thru the c preprocessor and into the makefile most of the c preprocessors that i have use will not treat such a a appear at the start of the line thus the c preprocessor do not treat the hash symbol a the start of a directive however the ibm cpp strip the comment and treat the hash symbol a the start of a directive the cpp fails when it determines that    this    be not a know directive i have temporarily hack my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a well fix 2 several imakefiles use      a a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro do not need a value for the parameter the aix cpp give warning about these situation but continue to work ok  if you be familiar with these problem and have solution i would appreciate information about on your solution perhaps this be solve in a later version of imake that i have not review also do you know of other cpp s that behave similarly
 i think you be run xapollo a x11r3 server     if you want a x11r4 server you should install pskq3 10 3 5 or 10 4 so you can run xdomain in xkeysymdb you could add apollo specific keysyms aplinedel 1000ff00 apchardel 1000ff01 apcopy 1000ff02 apcut 1000ff03 appaste 1000ff04 apmove 1000ff05 apgrow 1000ff06 apcmd 1000ff07 apshell 1000ff08 apleftbar 1000ff09 aprightbar 1000ff0a apleftbox 1000ff0b aprightbox 1000ff0c apupbox 1000ff0d apdownbox 1000ff0e appop 1000ff0f apread 1000ff10 apedit 1000ff11 apsave 1000ff12 apexit 1000ff13 aprepeat 1000ff14 apkp_parenleft 1000ffa8 apkp_parenright 1000ffa9    victor ______victor hpfrcu03 france hp com_______oooo_o_oooo_________________ victor gattegno
 suppose you have an idle app with a realize and mapped window that contains xlib graphic a button widget when press will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of render the image because at that time it be guaranteed that the window be mapped
 i be work on an x window base application that need to override some of the window manager focus processing i be use x11r4 and motif 1 1 currently although i will also be work with open look in the future what i need to do be under certain circumstance prevent the user from switch from one window of the application to another window let  s say for example that window a be on top of window b in the window hierarchy normally if the user click the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and place on top of window a  under certain circumstance if the user click the mouse in window b i need to beep and prevent window b from be raise on top of window a  from the research and test do so far it appear that this window order be handle by the window manager in this case motif i found any way to override this default processing through standard x window function i can tell when this switch occurs through focus change and mapping notify event but i find any way to tell motif not to make the switch the temporary solution currently come up with be very kludgy but it partially work when i detect such a window switch in those case when the switch be not allow i manually force the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call and beep with the xbell function this provide the necessary functionality but look ugly when the window switch place twice do anyone know how i can tell motif or preferably  any  window manager when i want the window order switch to actually take place respond either by e mail or post to this newsgroup cheer     randall
 i just have an idea not sure if it be do and just remember it unconsiously but i thought that in dialog box and whatever in windowing system there should be a way to intuitivly set some thing checked or unchecked or fill in a certain way my idea tape you know like put a piece of tape over a light switch just an idea if you like it use it
 the application creates window with a button    quit    and    press me    the button    press me    pop up a dialog box the strange feature of this program be that it always pop up the dialog box much faster the first time if i try to pop it up a 2nd time 3rd 4th     time it be  much  slow the shell be wait for the window manager to respond to it position request the window manager be not respond because it think the window be already in the right place exactly  why  the two component get into this sulk be unclear to me all information greatly receive thanks for this clue and thanks to derek ho also for a pointer in the same direction one solution due to derek ho when the popup be popped up we setvalue it location    which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup the slow response can be avoid by call getvalue first and only use setvalue if the require location be different the problem can also be avoid by make a tiny alteration in the location of the popup so that the setvalue really do change the location of the popup we try this just for a double check on the source of the problem the solution we have try successfully be now a follow 1 use    twm    or    mwm    rather than    olwm    2 use    olwm    with resource     wmtimeout 10    3 only reset the location of the popup window if it be truely change this be obviously work around some bug somewhere

 this       i try how can i do the workstation use have hardware cursor support or do the server generate a software cursor you can generally tell the difference just by use it if the cursor blink a lot when there  s screen activity probably a software cursor if it have a hardware cursor i think probably battling a bug in hp  s x server not familiar with any hardware cursor chip that display cursor great than 64x64 quite possible that the server be just echo your prefer cursor size without actually check it i vaguely recall that very old mit server revision do just that in reality probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server return
 and at least 500 more user unfriendly a well

   deleted     in plain motify use a dialog  in line like this simply do you need to set callback from the buttons widgets in your dialog and let the callback routine do the work in the callback you can then carry on the flow of logic xview from sun actually support this very neatly with a  notify box which can return a status in line it do actualy ease cod but go against the event driven style of an application summary redesign require

 i know any way except to see what modifier be on in th keypress event of course if there be some reason why you need to always know the state of modifier even if your window have the keyborads focus you can always ask for keypress event from the root window then you get all the keypresses and you always know what have be press i think this be just a question of how to implement xlookupstring you can always write another function that interprets the keypresses a you like you can look at the implementation of xlookupstring from the xlib source and then modify it a little bit

program that mean that you mail it a request and it mail back the response any of the four possible command must be the first word on a line the xstuff server read your entire message before it do anything so you can have several different command in a single message unless you ask for help the xstuff server treat the    subject    header line just like any other line of the message the archive be organize into a series of directory and subdirectory each directory have an index and each subdirectory have an index the top level index give you an overview of what be in the subdirectory and the index for each subdirectory tell you what be in it 1 the command    help    or    send help    cause the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file 2 if your message contains a line whose first word be    index    then the server will send you the top level index of the content of the archive if there be other word on that line that match the name of subdirectory then the index for those subdirectory be sent instead of the top level index for example you can say    send index fix    or    index fix    a message that request an index can not request data 3 if your message contains a line whose first word be    send    then the xstuff server will send you the item s name on the rest of the line to name an item you give it directory and it name for example send fix 1 4

send no more than a fix amount of data each day if the work queue contains more request than the day  s quota then the unsent file will not be process until the next day whenever the mailer be run to send it day  s quota it sends the request out shortest first 4 some mailer produce mail header that be unusable for extract return address if you use such a mailer you get any response if you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo bar bitnet mitvma mit edu or path bar foo frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it the xstuff server itself can be

 if willing to do a little work you can make drawnbuttons do what you want more or less one of my colleague here at ge crd have do just that in our internal lymb system we have a matrix transform class that make it easy to compute a series of dial position from a single set of vector each set of vector be then drawn into a pixmap click the button advance the knob  s state and change to the next pixmap in the sequence use drawnbuttons obviously still constrains you to take up a rectangular portion of the parent widget but normally not a big shortcoming you can make thing look circular enough

entry format x x we will reject entry that can not be compile use an ansi c x compiler certain old obfuscation hack that cause ansi c compiler x fit be no longer permit some of the new issue deal with x non integral array type variable number of argument c preprocessor x directive and the exit function see our like and dislike x x xhints and suggestion x x you be encourage to examine the winner of previous contest see x for more information for detail on how to get previous winner x x keep in mind that rule change from year to year so some win entry x may not be valid entry this year what be unique and novel one year x might be  old the next year x x an entry be usually examine in a number of way we typically apply x a number of test to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignore include line x c pre process the source ignore define and include line x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how your entry look in each of the above test x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it have be x  cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x x your entry need not do well under all or in most test in certain x case a test be not important entry that compete for the x  strangest most creative source layout need not do a well a x others in term of their algorithm on the other hand give x two such entry we be more inclined to pick the entry that x do something interest when you run it x x we try to avoid limit creativity in our rule a such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation a in real life x program interpret a requirement document or a customer request x be important for this reason we often award  worst abuse of the x rule to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rule we suggest that you let u know x in the remark section please note that an invitation to abuse x be not an invitation to break we be strict when it come to the x 3217 byte size limit also abuse the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there be hole in the rule and invite entry x to attempt to exploit them we will award  worst abuse of the rules  x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the small plug need if not small x x check out your program and be sure that it work we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that have a slight problem particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand we have see some x of the best entry fall down because they work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claim that x 16 be a prime number if you do have a bug you be well off x document it note    this entry sometimes print the 4th power x of a prime by mistake    would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly x work entry be best x x xour like and dislike x x do mass of defines to obscure the source have become  old we x tend to  see thru mass of defines due to our pre processor test x that we apply simply abuse defines or  dfoo bar go a far x a a program that be more well round in confusion x x many ansi c compiler dislike the follow code and so do we x x define d define x d foo    expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j    use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non ansi c such a k r c you must avoid area that result in x compile link error for ansi c compiler x x unfortunately ansi c require array index to be of integral type x thus the follow classical obfuscation hack be no longer allow x x int i x char  c x i c    use c i instead x i 3    string       use    string    i 3 instead x x if your entry us function that have a variable number of x argument be careful system implement va_list a a wide variety x of way because of this a number of operation use va_list be x not portable and must not be use x x assign a non va_list variable to from a va_list variable x cast a non va_list variable into from a va_list variable x passing a va_list variable to a function expect a non va_list arg x passing a non va_list variable to a function expect a va_list arg x perform arithmetic on va_list variable x use va_list a a structure or union x x in particular do not treat va_list variable a if they be a char     s x x avoid use varargs h use stdarg h instead x x if you use c preprocessor directive define if ifdef     x the lead must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the lead many do not x x because the exit function return void on some system entry x must not assume that it return an int x x small program be best when they be short obscure and concise x while such program be not a complex a other winner they do x serve a useful purpose they be often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for x program that be compact and be instructional x x one line program should be short one line program say around 80 x byte long get close to 160 byte be a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike program that x x be very hardware specific x be very o or un x version specific x index strchr difference be ok but socket streams specific x code be likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warning x it be ok only if you warn u in the  remark header item x compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abuse the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x be longer than they need to be x be similar to previous winner x be identical to previous loser x x unless you be cramped for space or unless you be enter the x  best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply form excessively long line x x the build file should not be use to try and get around the size x limit it be one thing to make use of a several  d  s to help out x but it be quite another to use 200  byte of  d  s in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you be well off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allow whitespace and in certain case or do not impact x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that be simply a compact blob of character x x give two version of the same program one that be a compact blob x of code and the other that be format more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that be format in an interest x and or obfuscate way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid try for the  smallest self replicating  x program we be amaze at the many different size that claim x to be the small there be nothing wrong with self replicating x program in fact a number of winner have be self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of  smallest l we or others x know of a small one x x x client entry should be a portable a possible entry that x adapt to a wide collection of environment will be favor x depend on a particular type of display for example depend x on color or a give size require backing store x x x client entry should avoid use x related library and x software that be not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entry restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set libx11 a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone x have them avoid depend on a particular window manager not x everyone have x11r5 and some people be stuck back in x11r4 or x earlier so try to target x11r5 without require x11r5 well x yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window system x x x client entry should not to depend on particular item on x  xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the require line x in the     remark    section x x we like program that x x be a concise and small a they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pas lint without complaint not a requirement but it be nice x be portable x be unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different type of obfuscation x make u laugh and or throw up x x some type of program excel in some area of course your x program have to excel in all area but do well in several x area really do help x x we freely admit that interest creative or humorous comment in x the     remark    section help your chance of win if you have to x read of many twist entry you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the reader of the contest winner do a well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help u process the many entry

they be declare winner at the start of the final round x we will invent award category for them if necessary x x in the final round process we perform the difficult task of x reduce the remain entry

out of the final round be x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but be beat out x by a similar but slightly well entry for this reason it be x sometimes worthwhile to

this path be to search first in  usr lib x11 then in  usr openwin let  s consider another example this time let  s set xuserfilesearchpath so it look for the file myterm ad in the current work directory then for myterm in the directory   app defaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath n ad home app defaults  n the first path in the list expands to   myterm ad the second expands to home app defaults myterm this be a convenient set for debug because it follow the imake convention of name the app defaults file myterm ad in the application  s source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you be work and still have the resource load properly note when look for app default file with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix be define so t and s be useless with r5 there  s another twist you may specify a customization resource value for example you might run the    myterm    application like this myterm  xrm     customization  color    if one of your pathname specification have the value     usr lib x11  t  n c    then the expand pathname would be     usr lib x11 app defaults myterm color    because the c substitution

you can set the path explicitly a you normally could for any sh script or you can place all environment setting statement in a separate file and source it from both the  xsession file and your shell configuration file or if you set your path in your  cshrc file the normal place you can make your  xsession have path set simply by make it a csh script i e by start your  xsession file off with

remote machine a more recent version be on export in xrsh 5 4 shar one solution be to use the xrlogin program from der mouse mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu you can ftp caveat emptor version from 132 206 1 1 in x xrlogin c and x xrlogind c the program package up term and display into a single string which be stuffed into term rlogin then propagates term normally your  cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind be a program that check term and if it be of the special format it recognizes unpacks it and spit out setenv and unsetenv command to recreate the environment variable 11 90 in addition if all you need to do be start a remote x process on another host and you find rsh host  n  usr bin x11 xterm  display display too simple display must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh can be use to start up remote x process the equivalent usage would be xrsh host xterm  bin sh start an x11 process on another host date 8 dec 88 06 29 34 gmt

last step that probably leave out you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory be in the path sometimes your    xset  fp dir    command fails with a badvalue error x error of fail request badvalue integer parameter out of range for operation major opcode of fail request 51 x_setfontpath this mean the x server can not find or read your font directory or that your directory do not look like a font directory to the server the mention of an    integer parameter    in the message be spurious    be the font directory specify readable from the server  s file system remember the server not the client which interprets your font directory trouble in this area be especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it e g    xset  fp   myfonts    and the server

 i be work on a project to provide an emergency management information system in keep with more classic command and control type system we be consider develop a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on own monitor i have a number of x level question regard this we be devloping on unix system use x motif platform will be predominantly sun  s probably with port to rs 6000 a well i be assume the standard dual monitor system be configure such that we be talk about one x display and multiple screen and not multiple x display give this be change input focus from one screen to the other a simple a track your mouse from one screen to the other there s nothing special that need to be do to shift focus between screen do i have to run separate window manager on the separate screen or be there multiscreen window manager out there what be they who sell them     be a multi screen window manager the only way i can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next be there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screen a one logical x y plane or do the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 0 0 any thought on the difficulty involve with design a system capable of use either multiple screen or a single screen perhaps run a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screen instead i be assume that this be not a major issue that i can rely on provide config file which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application any thought or suggestion from past experience be more than welcome

 i consider twm style squeeze title indispensable in a window manager i like to have two tall xterm window visible at the same time with no overlap and since two window enough i have other xterm window underneath them with exactly the same position in case not familiar with squeeze title here  s a crude picture                        figure 1                                                                                title a title b title c                                                                                  this be the window b hide window c but body of the you can still see c  s title window window a which be squeeze right                                                                                                         figure 1                                      squeeze title allow me to have about 5 such window in each stack with easy access and 3 per stack be usually more than i really need since i also insist on have a virtual wm the only problem be that the title location be static that be it be configure in  twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager do so be cumbersome and time consuming therefore i have implement f squeeze left center right function in my own copy of vtwm the idea be that with one click of a button you can change this                title a                                     this be the body of the window window a                                     to this                title a                                     this be the body of the window window a                                                     okay so far so good now how the heck do i get them to put this into the next    official    twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm and the next xyztwm that i never heard of one way would be to post in comp windows x a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why i think it be a very good thing and hope that someone read it in case it already clear why i think a very good thing look back up at figure 1 and picture window a move over on top of window b and c now window a  s title hide window b  s title but when you hit f squeezecenter the result be                                        title b title a title c                                                          this be the body of the window window a which be on top                                                                              the rest of this post explains how to implement it base on my x11r4 copy of vtvwm shar just a sketch because post the full diffs would be too long the key to this enhancement be to add the follow line in the executefunction routine in menus c ifdef shape case f_squeezeleft static squeezeinfo left_squeeze j_left 0 0 if deferexecution context func scr  selectcursor return true tmp_win  squeeze_info left_squeeze setframeshape tmp_win break     and similarly for squeezeright j_right and squeezecenter j_center     endif of course you also have to define f_squeezeleft in parse h and add    f squeezeleft    fkeyword f_squeezeleft     and so forth     to parse c in order to use these function add something like the follow to your  twmrc file button2 m s w v d r i t door f squeezecenter                   about a year ago i post this but our news be broken and i  think  it get out since then    blast    have appear in comp sources x volume 19 issue 41 you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chisel away at an mwm style wide title well to have a twm style window manager i think    ralph betza fm uunet ssiny gnohmon gnohmon ssiny com

 hello i be test a port of x11r5 to coherent a unix clone o for intel architecture machine i be see a strange problem with text in client like xvt a simple terminal emulator program the problem manifest it self when the shell echo typed character back to the server for display one at a time the character appear to be too closely space with the result be that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character and so on it look like there be an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character there be no problem between the character when the shell return a complete line of text     only when the output be a series of individual character if anyone have any idea what the problem might be or where i should look to find it it would be much appreciate regard and thanks jon dhuse

 i  think  this be correct behavior remember the default colormapfocuspolicy be keyboard meaning the cmap focus follow the keyboard focus since the dialog be modal mwm allow keyboard focus onto your main shell and so it allow cmap focus either since it sound a though you have keyboardfocuspolicy pointer i suggest you set colormapfocuspolicy pointer also that way the cmap focus slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat it own path if you have keyboardfocuspolicy explicit you can set cmap focus explicit also but you then need a binding to f focus_color probably on mb1

 the situation run a fortran executable that creats an xterm an option in the menu contain in the xterm run a fortran subroutine that creats a tektronics mode xterm for display some graphic type a ret while the tektronics mode xterm future reference to this will be    tek term    be active make the xterm read future keystroke but do not shift input focus to the xterm base that statement on the fact that the border of the tek term stay the highlight color and that the tek term stay on top of xterm if what describe input focus let me know the xterm can be brought to the top by click the mouse button on it subsequent selection from the xterm of the menu item that display graphic highlihts the border and display the update graphic but do not move the tek term to the top if the tek term have be iconized to conserve screen space it stay an icon the desire behavior one of two option 1  whichever of the window that be active be always on top of the inactive one 2  whenever the tek term be inactivate it should revert to a icon but when it be activate it should become a window on a high level than the xterm what i think i need a mean of specify that a xterm or tek term will be at the high level and a way to iconify expand a xterm and tek term these command would guess need to be in the fortran or in the command that start up the xterm and tek term other information all this be take place on a vt 1300 a dec dumb x windows terminal connect to a vax run vms and motif thanks for your time if get any word of wisdom other than    give up    please send email to

 i expect what be go on here be that your colormap be full and when the new application start up it can not add the color that it need to the colormap it therefore have to pick and choose from the exist color this make it look ugly until window get priority then macx change the colormap so that the select app be get the exact color it want but now other application be have to make do with colormap this be a problem with all color x server or at least all color xservers i have see when the demand of the application exceed the size of the colormap my solution be usually to 1 avoid colormap greedy apps and 2 display application where color be just ice on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color if this be an option for the application doug shaker voice 415 572 0200 fax 415 572 1300 email dshaker qualix com mail qualix group 1900 s  norfolk st  224 san mateo ca 94403

 to incrementally update the content of window i use the follow trick 1  set the window background to none 2  call xcleararea display window 0 0 0 0 true 3  restore the window background to it correct value the call to xcleararea do not repaint the window background but still generates exposure event for visible part of the window in order to let my application know that these expose event must be handle incrementally something be already displayed on the screen and may need to be erase i encapsulate the 3 operation with 2 self address client message which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server xgrabserver display client message start incremental background none xcleararea restore background client message end incremental xungrabserver display the grabserver prevents other event to be insert by the server in the critical section

 the problem be that motif us xgrabkey to implement menu accelerator and these grab be specific about which modifier apply unfortunately the specification for xgrabkey allow anymodifier to be combine with other modifier which be exactly what would be desire in this case    ctrl any key q    this be true for accelerator and mnemonic which be implement use event handler instead of grab not true for menu accelerator if a motif implementor suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics change to support the feature i described above otherwise change the documentation for menu accelerator to properly set the user s expectation because menu accelerator be not the same thing a translation if you mean    menu accelerator    no not possible accord to the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page i think of a reason why not there be a workaround for motif user in addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the xmpushbutton gadget set an xtnaccelerators resource on the shell toplevel or application install the shell s accelerator on itself and all of it descendant with xtinstallallaccelerators shell shell for example applicationshell mainwindow menubar filecascade    filepulldown openpushbutton exitpushbutton  openpushbutton accelerator ctrl key o  openpushbutton acceleratortext ctrl o  exitpushbutton accelerator ctrl key q  exitpushbutton acceleratortext ctrl q  applicationshell accelerators override  n   ctrl key o performaction  openpushbutton armandactivate   n   ctrl key q performaction  exitpushbutton armandactivate you have to write and add the application action performaction which you can implement by use xtnametowidget on the first argument and then xtcallactionproc with the rest of the argument i test out something similar to this to shorten development time i use teleuse  s tuninstallaccelerators resource to install the accelerator on the shell and i directly invoked the open and quit d action instead of ask the pushbuttons to do it for me but the more general approach i described above should work

 write an x server for some video generation equipment the hardware be    truecolor    in yuv space in x term it have a 24 bit static color visual i would really like to have the server just present this static visual but not sure if this will be acceptable to    most    x client the three problem i see be 1 the colormap though huge be static 2 all pixel would be 3 byte wide 3 because the hardware actually life in yuv space the translation rgb  yuv will introduce some round error be more of a server guy than a client guy i ask will these limitation thwart many x client or will most of the x stuff float around blithely accept what give i could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of e g  8 bit but rather avoid this if not necessary i know there be no absolute but appreciate hearing people s opinion and suggestion thanks

 hello folk see these error when i try to modify my key map mwm invalid accelerator specfication line x add a line in the start up file before the line that start mwm it look like the follow xmodmap keymapfile mwm i think that the problem have to do with a conflict between function key f1 through f7 which already have assign function e g move minimize etc the odd thing be that i see these error if i run xmodmap keymapfile from an xterm can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map specifically f1 through f7 and not have mwm motif window manager complain i realize this be a bit stupid but we only have time to implement not time to learn how to implement

 i use to think this way and not just about x  for example incorrect english construct such a    it rain    or    window id    annoy me however there come a time when popular usage start to dictate the way thing really be in the world indeed the fact that x won out over news be really down to popular opinion i know we all think technically superior a well on a related topic who be to say that    color    be more or less correct than    colour    be irish and hence use english english a oppose to american english i always use the latter except of course for api term such a    xalloccolor    and    colormap    in a world that us the term    window    to refer to microsoft window perhaps the time have come to accept    x window    a a valid term for x  i think that this be a more concise and uncluttered term than say    the x window system    and let  s face it almost everyone us it ultimately we all need product sale to more than just x literate people in this respect product recognition be important and a short snappy descriptive title    x    be positively obscure will help when deal with the average punter sad i thought i be a software engineer indeed it be unfortunate that x do not become popularly know a window and let m worry about whether it should be call    microsoft window    or    the microsoft window system    or how about just plain    microsoft    to summarise or should that be    summarize    the point of this message i think there be far more press issue face the x community than worry about subtle distinction in the name of the window system or should that be    windowing system    whatever get recognise be fine by me i agree that one should be careful in interpret what trade paper say however i would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the x window system
 i post this a while ago and recieve one reply and now we have another bug report on the same subject can anybody help me out how can you ensure that accelerator work the same independent of case what i want be ctrl o and ctrl o to both be accelerator on one menu entry in os vol 6 in the section on accelerator it say    for information on how to specify translation table see vol 4        this be so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource if you go to vol 4 it say    likewise if a modifier be specify there be nothing to prohibit other modifier from be present a well for example the translation shift key q quit will take effect even if the ctrl key be held down at the same time a the shift key and the q key this implies to me that set xmnaccelerator to ctrl key o should do what i want but it it work if the user press the control key the shift key and the o key be it possible to supply 1 accelerator for a menu entry keep in mind when answer this question that when use motif you use xtinstallaccelerators i be use motif 1 1 3 on a decstation 5000 but i have also try it on an hp use motif 1 1 3 and 1 2

 if you need speed and your client can run on the same host a the x server you should use the share memory extension to the sample x server mit shm xdpyinfo will tell you if your server have this extension this be certainly available with the sample mit x server run under sunos a word of warn make sure your kernel be configure to support share memory and another word of warn openwindows be slow than the mit server i have write an image tool use xview for the gui by the way which yield over 10 frame per second for 512 512 8 bit image run on a sparc ipc half the cpu grunt of an ipx this have prove quite sufficient for animation regard

 a apply to server the first three be fuzzy term    multi headed    tends to be use for any system with multiple monitor sometimes even multiple screen even if multiplexed onto the same monitor eg a sun with a cg4 display    multi screen    and    multi display    would if take strictly mean different thing but since the strict meaning of    multi display    would refer to a system with multiple keyboard and pointer when use it probably refers to the same thing    multi screen    would a system that provide multiple screen    zaphod    be a term apply to the way the mit server switch the pointer from one screen to another by slide it off the side of the screen there be a protocol limitation that restricts a give display to at most 255 screen i know of no server that handle multiple display on a single invocation unless possibly my kludge to the r4 server can be look upon a such on a tcp based system there be necessarily a limit of 65535 display per machine but this be not a limitation inherent to x  what you read be most likely talk about a limit in some particular implementation probably the mit one if it claimed there be a limit of 12 inherent to x the author of the article have no business write about x  der mouse

                                          subject 16 what be    low bandwidth x    lbx xremote ppp slip cslip there be several option for use x over serial line slip serial line ip this be both a mechanism and a protocol for send ip packet over point to point serial link it have be around for several year and implementation be available for many of the major tcp ip implementation most x terminal vendor supply this a a checkoff item although nobody really ever us it since it be horribly slow the tcp ip header add 40 byte per packet and the tcp ip encode of the x protocol be rather verbose rightfully so it be optimize for pack and unpack over high speed link cslip compress header slip this be a variant of slip that compress the 40 byte of tcp ip header down to about 5 or 6 byte it still do anything about reencoding the x protocol modem that do compression can help but they increase packet latency it take time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interface plus the compression assembly time ppp point to point protocol this be an emerge standard for point to point link over serial line that have a more complete set of option negotiation than slip a grow number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial line management and cslip for the header compression a become common for run normal tcp ip protocol over serial line run raw x over the wire still need compression somewhere to make it usable xremote this be the name of both a protocol and set of product originally developed by ncd for squeeze the x protocol over serial line in addition to use a low level transport mechanism similar to ppp cslip xremote remove redundancy in the x protocol by send delta against previous packet and use lzw to compress the entire data stream this work be do by either a pseudo x server or    proxy    run on the host or in a terminal server there be several advantage to do compression outside the modem 1 you  have  to have compress modem in there if you otherwise be use them e g if you be go to be directly connect and 2 it reduces the i o overhead by cut down on the number of byte that have to cross the serial interface and 3 in addition to the effect of 2 it reduces the latency in deliver packet by not require the modem to buffer up the data wait for block to compress lbx low bandwidth x this be an x consortium project that be work on a standard for this area it be be chair by ncd and xerox and be use ncd  s xremote protocol a a step stone in develop the new protocol lbx will go beyond xremote by add proxy cache of commonly used information e g connection setup data large window property font metric keymaps etc and a more efficient encode of the x protocol the hope be to have a standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in r6 additional technical information about how xremote work and a few note on how lbx might be different be available via anonymous ftp from

the window manager in x be just another client    it be not part of the x window system although it enjoys special privilege    and so there be no single window manager instead there be many which

happen be that you be run your window manager a the last job in your  xsession or  xinitrc file your x session run only a long a the last job be run and so kill your window manager be equivalent to log out instead run the window manager in the background and a the last job instead invoke something safe like exec xterm  name login  rv  iconic or any special client of your devise which exit on some user action your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window whether or not you kill or restart your window manager

to be produce when you press a particular key the xmodmap client which be useful for move your ctrl and esc key to useful place just rearranges key and do not do    macro expansion    some few client

reset the display locally within an xterm it take effect for new xterm client to include control character in the string use   nnn where nnn be the octal encode of the control character you want to

 hi xperts this be a repost no one respond to my desperate yell 8  i believe there be no xview wizard any more 8      use slider in my xview apps usually with editable numeric field but i seem to have no control over the length of this field in some apps it appear long enough to keep several character in some it can not keep even the maximum value set by panel_max_value a i understand panel_value_display_length which control number of character to be displayed in text item work in the case of slider despite the fact that panel h contains the follow bit    panel_multiline_text_item panel_numeric_text_item panel_slider_item and panel_text_item attribute    panel_notify_level panel_attr attr_enum 152 panel_value_display_length panel_attr attr_int 182 which give a hint that this attribute can be use for slider but 1 set this attribute give nothing and 2 xv_get ting this attribute give warn bad attribute and return value 0  strange thing be that dec  s port of xview give plenty of space in a text field but not sun  s xview     can someone share his experience in manage slider in xview with me and clear this problem any help be very much appreciate yuri
 gotten very few post on this group in the last couple day i recently add it to my feed list be it just me or be this group near death
 stuff delete hear hear i agree completely one thing i stand about the mac interface be it shear determination to force you to use the mouse what if your mouse break    your whole system be down i like the mouse    it be handy on some occassions such a cut and past and move icon around etc but for most work the keyboard and hot key be 10 20 time faster than use the mouse sure it be a plus to be able to do something simple if you be an inexperienced user but how long be it before your be experienced a month two speak of pc at the moment i think it be too much to ask that window programmer provide not only a menu mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot key and command line interface which usually allows you to do more in less time if you be experienced all of the above equally applies to windowing system on unix especially since unix be at least 500 more powerful than do
 hint for sun o user use  usr 5bin echo instead of  bin echo or csh  s built in echo otherwise have to embed literal esc and bel character in the string instead of use convenient octal sequence bad idea use  usr 5bin echo be slow than the built in echo this be what i do it do execute hostname once per shell window and do read in one extra file but manipluating the title do not require execute extra program oh yes it do execute some program once per each system but it store them in a file for the next time     if hostname then setenv hostname hostname endif figure how how to generate escape bell and echo command without a a line terminator i may have do this before if so the variable e be set have i execute this script before on this system if e then echo    already set the echo variable     dev tty else if  f    echo  hostname then source    echo  hostname else if echo  n  wc  l    0 then echo    built in echo be bsd     dev tty then berkeley style echo echo  set ech    echo  n       echo  hostname echo    set e echo a tr a    033       echo  hostname echo    set b echo a tr a    007       echo  hostname echo  set n          echo  hostname source    echo  hostname else echo    built in echo be sysv     dev tty echo  set ech    echo       echo  hostname echo  set e      033       echo  hostname echo  set b      007       echo  hostname echo  set n      c       echo  hostname source    echo  hostname endif be we use shelltool cmdtool or xterm duplicate these alias here to avoid problem if term    sun  then sun alias alias header ech    e l    1 e n    alias iheader ech    e l    1 e n    else if term    xterm then alias header ech    e 2  1 b n    alias iheader ech    e 1  1 b n    endif
 i have a sun 3 60 that have a mono framebuffer bwtwo0 built on the motherboard the same system also have a cgfour cgfour0 and bwtwo1 daughterboard i have be use this system with a color monitor have a color    front    screen from the cgfour and a mono    back    screen from the bwtwo1 both on the same tube i recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 sun mono monitor and i would like to make a two head system with the cgfour0 and the bwtwo0 i do not care if i loose the    back    screen on the color tube from the bwtwo1 after look through the xsun man page i be not sure if this be possible have anybody sucessfuly do this before
 one the application may not have be start from a terminal emulator if it be the terminal emulator may not still exist and if it do it may be in no condition to be    pop ped to the top    eg it may be iconified and even if you can it may not do what you want consider a virtual root window manager like tvtwm with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop outside the real desktop some but not all x terminal emulator provide environment variable give a window id even if such a thing be present in the environment it may not be what you want it may correspond to a window on a different server for example der mouse
 i have a peculiar color problem with macx apple  s macintosh x server like to know if others have see the same problem happen with the current version 1 2 and with version 1 1 7  when some type of client window be displayed part of the window be in the wrong color if the window be move slightly force the server to repaint it it be repaint in the correct color it happen for xterm window but have happen for graphic window and with some motif client

 forgive me if this be a faq i have checked the list but i cant find it i have a problem with the cursor within xterm on mono not grayscale monitor the problem be that when i have an character application that display input field in reverse video the xterm text cursor get lose on the edge of the input field the solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block but how do you do this i find any mean although various source seem to indicate it can be do when the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outline block this would also be preferable but i seem to force this to be the default either configuration be motorola 88k x11r4 please reply by email if po thank you                                                                                                                      steve weet european mi motorola cellular subscriber group beechgreen court chineham basingstoke hants england phone  44 0 256 790154 e mail stevew chineham euro csg mot com fax  44 0 256 817481 mobile  44 0 850 335105 post w10075
 yes look up xv_depth also you might want to try use xview colormap segment instead of xlib for your colormap stuff they will probably be easy for you to use and since you be use a truecolor visual you be lose anything compare to straight xlib
 g day window nt be a step forward but not by much i guess for do user who think multi tasking be really _neat_ add puke here and be overjoyed to be able to use more than 64k of memory it a major improvement for window user it more like an upgrade with facility most unix user take for grant most of window user only use pc for text processing or run 3rd party application anyway so the operating system feature be not even a real issue my ideal operating system binary compatible across all plaforms it should recognize binary and configure on the fly so i have to have bin mac bin dos bin dec bin sun bin hp etc     multi cpu so i can use the cpu on my pc and w s and mac and transputers and dsps i know a single site which have go for a single vendor i be not go to trade in 80mflops per h1 transputer or ultra fast fft on dsp chip note nt run on symmetric multi cpu system built in portable gui graphics tool you can call drawbutton or drawline and it do the same thing no matter what platform or display it should also translate graphic command on the fly so i can use pc graphic s w on my workstation and x software on my pc i think gui be not just nice to have but essential configurable front end so you can make it look like unix or do or nt or os 2 and run shell script or command bat file object orient so i can program easily under it and not have to re invent the wheel if the networking be not up to scratch or my application need to access source object code on the fly in other word it should have some ai capability that and a tight clean kernel so you can actually understand it anyone know of something like this adios ata

where do i get it 3  what be xfree86 xfree86 be an enhance version of x386 1 2 which be distribute with x11r5 this release consists of many bug fix speed improvement and other enhancement here be the highlight of the enhancement 1 the speedup package from glenn lai be an integral part of xfree86 selectable at run time via the xconfig file some speedup require an et4000 base svga and others require a virtual screen width of 1024  the speedup suitable to the configuration be select by default with a high quality et4000 board vram this can yield up to 40 improvement of the xstones benchmark over x386 1 2 2 the fx386 package from jim tsillas be include a the default operating mode if speedup be not select this mode be now equivalent in performance to x386 1 1b x11r4 and approximately 20 faster than x386 1 2 3 support for localconn compile time selectable for server client or both this support be for both svr3 2 and svr4 for svr4 0 4 with the  advanced compatibility package local connection from sco xsight odt client be support 4 driver for ati and trident tvga8900c and tvga9000 svga chipsets refer to the file readme ati and readme trident for detail about the ati and trident driver 5 support for compress bitmap font have be add thomas eberhardt s code from the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu 6 type1 font code from mit contrib tape have be include and be compile time selectable there be contribute type1 font in the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu 7 new configuration method which allows the server  s driver and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distribution 8 integrate support for 386bsd mach and linux 9 a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga card be now include the follow key feature be add with the release of xfree86 1 2 they be not in xfree86 1 1 1 the monochrome server have be enhance to do bank switching of available svga memory to allow virtual screen up to 1600x1200 see the x386 1 manual page for more information 2 support for the hercules mono card have be add to the monochrome server and with it the ability to support a    two head    server one vga and one hercules so far this have only be test on svr4 it be also report to work under linux 3 svr3 share library test under isc svr3 2 2 and 3 0 1 4 support for svr4 2 there be some special consideration to consider due to new usl bug see the readme svr4 file for more information 5 support for ps 2 mouse and logitech mouseman trackman some version of these device be not previously compatible 6 a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data write by eric raymond derive from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation 7 greatly improve support for international keyboard include implementation of the compose key functionality found on many vendor server see the x386keybd 1 manual page for more information 8 the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clock have be improve and the timing be now store at accuracy of 0 1 mhz user may want to consider remove an exist clock line from their xconfig file and re probing use the new server 9 many enhancement in error handle and parse of the xconfig configuration file error message be much more informative and intuitive and more validation be do there be many new option that can be enable in the xconfig file see the x386 1 manual page for more information on the format of this file plus a number of other small thing refer to the changelog file in the source distribution for full detail also include be a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond and the current x386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by david wexelblat 4  what os be support xfree86 support svr4 2 consensys v4 2 svr4 0 microport dell esix isc at t mst consensys uhc svr3 isc 2 2 3 0 at t 2 2 linux mach 386 386bsd 0 1 bsd 386 be not support but it should work the most active bsd 386 person be greg lehey grog lemis de note that esix 3 2d and sco be not support yet but anyone should feel free to submit patch if you be interested in tackle this send mail to xfree86 physics su oz au 5  what video hardware be support at this time xfree86 1 2 support the follow svga chipsets tseng et4000 tseng et3000 paradise pvga1 western digital wd90c00 wd90c10 wd90c11 these be supersets of the pvga1 and use it driver genoa gvga trident tvga8900c tvga9000 ati 18800 28800 all of the above be support in both 256 color and monochrome mode with the exception of the ati chipsets which be only support in 256 color mode the monochrome server also support generic vga card use 64k of video memory in a single bank and the hercules card on the et3000 only 64k of video memory be support for the monochrome server and the gvga have not be test with more than 64k it appear that some of the svga card manufacturer be go to non traditional mechanism for select pixel clock frequency to avoid have to modify the server to accommodate these scheme xfree86 1 2 add support for use an external program to select the pixel clock this allows program to be write a new mechanism be discover refer to the readme clkprog file for information on how these program work if you need to write one if you do develop such a program the xfree86 team would be interested in include it with future xfree86 release if you be purchasing new hardware for the purpose of use xfree86 it be suggest that you purchase an et4000 based board such a the orchid prodesigner ii avoid recent diamond board xfree86 will not work with them because diamond provide program detail in fact the xfree86 project be actively not support new diamond product a long a such policy remain in effect contribution of code will not be accepted because of the potential liability if you would like to see this change tell diamond about it some people have ask if xfree86 would work with local bus or eisa video card theoretically the mean of communication between the cpu and the video card be irrelevant to xfree86 compatibility it could be isa eisa or local bus what should matter be the chipset on the video card unfortunately the developer have a lot of access to eisa or vlb machine so this be largely an untested theory however we have yet to see any report of thing not work on one of these bus and we have several report of xfree86 work fine on them 6  what about accelerate board at this time there be no support in xfree86 for accelerate board like the s3 ati ultra 8514 a tiga etc this support be available in commercial product from sgcs and metrolink for svr3 and svr4 an s3 server be available for 386bsd and linux contact hasty netcom com for 386bsd or jon robots ox ac uk for linux a beta 8514 a server be available for linux contact martin cs unc edu or jon robots ox ac uk note these server be not part of xfree86 7  why xfree86 support 16 color vga mode the reason that this be not support be the way vga implement the 16 color mode in 256 color mode each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel but the 16 color mode be implement a bit  plane each byte of frame  buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixel and there be four such plane the mit frame  buffer code be not design to deal with this if vga handle 16 color mode by pack 2 4 bit pixel into each byte the mit code could be modify to support this or it already may not sure but for the vga way of do thing a complete new frame buffer implementation be require some beta tester be look into this but nothing be yet available from the project 8  what other hardware or software requirement be there obviously a support svga board and o be require to run x efficiently 12 16mb of memory should be consider a minimum the various binary release take 10 40mb of disk space depend on the o e g whether or not it support share library to build from source at least 80mb of free disk space will be require although 120mb should be consider a comfortable low

to take from the archive and which compile time option selection be make when building the distribution iv what general thing should i know about run xfree86 11  installation directory the top level installation directory be specify by the projectroot  usr x386 by default variable in config site def binary include file and library be instal in projectroot  bin include lib this can be change when rebuild from source and can be modify via symbolic link for those os that support them this directory be nonstandard and be chosen this way to allow xfree86 to be instal alongside a commercial vendor supplied x implementation 12  configuration file the xfree86 server read a configuration file    xconfig    on startup the search path content and syntax for this file be document in the server manpage which should be consult before ask question 13  determine vga dot clock and monitor mode david e wexelblat dwex mtgzfs3 att com maintains a database of know clock setting for vga card and monitor setting the database be instal in  usr x386 lib x11 etc modedb txt and be in the source tree under mit server ddx x386 etc this database be also available from him for the late copy and be kept on export lcs mit edu in   contrib x386 modedb z which be update occasionally obtain a copy of this database it just might have the setting you need if you create new setting please send them to david for inclusion in the database if this help you the videomodes doc by eric raymond file with xfree86 contains tutorial on how to come up with these timing it may be helpful to start with setting that almost work and use this description to get them right when you do send the information to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database note the old  clock exe program be not support any more and be completely unnecessary if you need to determine dot clock value for a new board remove the  clocks line from your xconfig file if present and start the server the server will probe for clock itself and print them out you can use these value to put a  clocks line into your xconfig file which be not necessary but will speed up start the server in the future 14  rebuilding reconfiguring the server from the link kit if you have instal the server binary link kit it be possible to reconfigure the driver and font renderers in the server this be fully explain in the readme file that be available with the link kit v what os specific thing should i know about run xfree86 first of all the server must be instal suid root mode 4755 15  svr4 why my xterm run properly if your kernel be not built with the consem module you should define consem no in you environment otherwise xterm run csh user should use  setenv consem no  the esix console driver patch 403019 be know to cause keymapping problem with xfree86 it recommend that this patch not be instal alternatively they keymap can be fix with xmodmap 16  svr3 make sure you look at ftp readme isc if what you be run 17 386bsd make sure you look at ftp readme 386bsd also a separate 386bsd faq be maintain by richard murphey rich rice edu the late version should be available in the file xfree86 1 2 386bsd faq at the follow ftp site

the file readme present with the distribution on tsx 11 mit edu 19  mach make sure you look at ftp readme mach vi what thing should i know for building xfree86 from source this section have be remove from the faq since it be fully explain in ftp readme and the os specific readmes please look at those file for information on building xfree86 vii be there anything special about building client with xfree86 20  bsd compatibility library a lot of client make use of bsd function like bcopy etc the default configuration file be set up to link with libxbsd a which contains emulation for bcopy bzero bcmp ffs random seed a well way of provide the b function be to include x11 xfuncs h in source file that call them xfuncs h provide macro definition for these in term of the sysv  mem function if you be link with a vendor supply library which call some of these function then you should link with libxbsd a 21  ansiccoptions this be something that be add to allow a developer to get rid of the ansi ness define in the default ccoptions without have to rewrite the entire ccoptions line for example with stock mit see something like ccoptions      ansi  o2  fwritable strings    and to get rid of the ansi ness the developer would have to put ccoptions      o2  fwritable strings    in his imakefile with this change you would see a default of ansiccoptions      ansi    ccoptions      o2  fwritable strings    and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile be ansiccoptions  to get rid of the ansi ness many x client will die a horrible death with  ansi the effect be even more dramatic in practice because ccoptions be actually quite complex the other issue be that one must add  ansiccoptions  ansiccoptions to a passcdebugflags definition xfree86 contact information ongoing development

 when some type of client window be displayed part of the window be in the wrong color if the window be move slightly force the server to repaint it it be repaint in the correct color it happen i have the exact same problem when run hewlett packard  s microwave design system md from an hp 380 unix box and run macx 1 2 sys 7 0 1  normally md draw a window with a deep blue backround but occasionally it becomes a light blue and all the text etc inside the window become    wash out    nearly invisible i thought that it be just something brain dead that i be do or a subtle conflict with another app or init by slightly move the window and force a re draw the color get correct

 sorry but olwm and tvtwm do it they place the title at that position and the window at a position below it this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save it current configuration and restore be later currently my solution be xcreatewindow     xsetwmproperties    xmapwindow     xflush     xmovewindow     it work with olwm but be less than elegant all this leaf me wonder if overlook something obvious richard i know that the mwm have an resource to specify if position be to be use for the border of a window or for the    user    window maybe other window manager have similar option another way to figure out the difference between the    user    window position and the window manager decoration window position be to subtract their position you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager decoration window be the parent of your window unfortunately you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window have be mapped this way

 no it it be the    x window system    or    x11    or    x    or any of a number of other designation accepted by the x consortium in fact do    man x    on pretty much any x11 machine will tell you the x consortium request that the follow name be use when refer to this software x x window system x version 11 x window system version 11 x11 there be no such thing a    x window    or    x window    despite the repeat misuse of the form by the trade rag this probably tell you something about how much to trust the trade rag    if they even get the name of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have to say with regard to dialup x11 implementation there be several you can buy serial x11 terminal from a couple of company include both graphon and ncd in fact compose this from an ncd run x11 over serial line across 14 4 kbaud connection ncd also sell a software only package that provide xremote which be ncd  s implementation of serial x11 for pc  s there may be other such software package available x11r6 be suppose to include a standardize compression scheme for run x11 over low speed connection call low bandwidth x lbx and be base on improve version of the technique use in ncd  s xremote it seem likely that once lbx be release a a consortium standard there will be several vendor willing to supply implementation for various sort of hardware followup direct to comp windows x

 no a soon a you blit two of this icon once on top of the other with a little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crash too much of the icon first blitted because it draw a full rectangle the way to do it be mask create a bitmap with all pixel to be merge be 1 and all not to be merge be 0  then set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x y coordinate where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use gxcopy and xcopyarea the icon pixmap to the destination drawable use this gc

 these be two common subject so i hope someone have have to deal with these specific question 1  if my application depends on modifier what be the best lookup method my choice be to call xgetmodifiermapping for each key press with a modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifier in a lookup table i would like to do it the second way but i seem to get the notify when the user us xmodmap to remap the modifier i know that when an app call xsetmodifiermapping a mappingnotify event be generate non maskable which i can pick up and modify my internal table but i seem to get any notify event when the user us xmodmap if i use xt all o reilly have to say be     be automatically handle by xt     if i use xlib ala xnextevent i get nothing this all stem from problem with user of the sun 4 5 keyboard and the numlock plus various alt meta etc modifier requirement 2  i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window i want it at the same y coord and their right left side touch what i need to ask for be the x y coord of the window manager  s border for the main window this should ring a bell with anyone who have call xtmovewidget immediately check the x y after the move and see that it be right and in their next callback ask for the x y and see that it be now offset by the wm border any help would be most appreciate
 how can we resist a question that say something like this if your expose event handler be truly intelligent about expose rectangle information then you can use xcleararea to generate an expose event assume that your background pixel be not none for the enclose rectangle of your new item this be still not great since any other item contain within that rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn if your expose event handler simply redraws everything be do much more work than just draw the new item    on top    of the exist scene

                                                                                                        in brief xlib xt and most widget set have no mutual exclusion for critical section any interrupt handler be likely to leave one of the above library in an inconsistent state    such a all the appropriate flag not yet set dangle pointer in the middle of a list traversal etc note that the ansi c standard point out that behavior of a signal handler be undefined if the signal handler call any function other than signal itself so this be not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mention other function which may be call safely but it may not be assume that these function be call by xlib or xt function the only safe way to deal with signal be to set a flag in the interrupt handler this flag later need to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback it be incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler a another note it be dangerous to add a work procedure that never finish this effectively preempt any work procedure previously add and so they will never be call another option be to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end use xtappaddinput and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal however this could deadlock your process if the pipe fill up why the intrinsics deal with this problem primarily because it be suppose to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system be that a good enough reason    i think so note the article in the x journal 1 4 and the example in o reilly volume 6 be in error                                                                                                          4  how do i use a different visual than the default                                                                                                          this require a more complicate answer than it should a window have three thing that be visual specific    the visual colormap and border pixmap all widget have their own colormap and borderpixmap resource only shell widget have visual resource another question deal with why shell have a visual the default value of these resource be copyfromparent which do exactly what it say in the shell widget copyfromparent get evalulated a defaultvisualofscreen and defaultcolormapofscreen when any one of the three resource be not properly set a badmatch error occurs when the window be create they be not properly set because each of the value depends on the visual be use how to get this to work there be two part to the answer the first be if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second be if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual the second be actually easy because the basic information you need be available the first be a little harder because need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the need information    some sample code to start up an application use something other than the default visual to compile cc  g visual c  o visual  lxaw  lxmu  lxt  lxext  lx11  lm to run   visual

                           this be a point that can be argue about but one opinion be there be no way for an application to know the appropriate visual    it have to be specify by the user if you disagree with this then your application probably fall into the category of always use the default visual or it be hardware specific and expect some particular visual such a 24bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension or some such why no application run in isolation depend on the way a server allocates resource i may not always want your application to run in truecolor mode if it be go to mess up my other application i may be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor or just monochrome a an example on a low end color sun server there be many different possible visuals monochrome 256 entry colormap static gray static color and a 3 3 2 truecolor the sgi iris  s offer all the above plus 12 bit truecolor 24 bit truecolor an overlay plane                                                                                                          6  why do only shell widget have a visual                                                                                                          this be strictly by convention it make it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it us can be found by look for the shell widget that be it ancestor and obtain the visual of that shell a widget can have it own visual resource if it do it must have it own realize method to use the visual when it call xcreatewindow you should also make this a resource that can be obtain with xtgetvalues so other widget can find it a reasonable value be probably xtnvisual                                                                                                          7  which visual depth and colormap do shell inherit                                                                                                          the default value for these resource be set to copyfromparent this be interpret a the defaultcolormapofscreen defaultdepthofscreen and the default visual of the screen if the widget have no parent    i e it be an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree if the parent of the widget be not null then the shell copy colormap and depth from it parent and us copyfromparent a the visual                                                                                                          8  do all the above and i still get a badmatch error why                                                                                                          some resource converter improperly cache reference this be especially true of x11r3 and earlier version of motif                                                                                                          9  why my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget                                                                                                          see section 2 8 of the xt specification it eventually do get destroyed just not immediately the intrinsics destroy a widget in a two phase process first it and all of it child have a flag set that indicate it be be destroyed it be then put on a list of widget to be destroyed this way any pending x event or far reference to that widget can be clean up before the memory be actually freed the second phase be then perform after all callback event handler and action have complete before check for the next x event at this point the list be traverse and each widget  s memory be actually free  d among other thing a some far caveats trivia the widget may be destroyed if the intrinsics determine that they have no far reference to the widget on the list if so then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately also if nest event loop be use widget place on the destroy list before enter the inner event loop be not destroyed until return to the outer event loop                                                                                                          10  how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks                                                                                                          the problem be if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exit an application be use such a call exit directly then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state    such a open socket temporary file allocate x resource etc this code for simplicity reason assumes only a single toplevel widget widget toplevelget gw widget gw    widget to find toplevel    widget top for top gw xtparent top top xtparent top    empty    return top void exitcallback gw closure call_data widget gw    widget    xtpointer closure    data the app specify    xtpointer call_data    widget specific data    widget toplevel toplevel toplevelget gw xtunmapwidget toplevel    make it disappear quickly    xtdestroywidget toplevel exit 0 one can see that the above code ex immediately after destroy the toplevel widget the trouble be the phase 2 destruction may never occur this work for most widget and most application but will not work for those widget that have any external state you might think that since it work now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object orient approach be use be so one can be ignorant of the implementation detail for each widget which mean that the widget may change and someday require that some external state be clean up by the destroy callback one alternative be to modify exitcallback to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop however private event loop be frown upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and difficult to maintain practice try the follow code instead include x11 intrinsic h extern widget toplevelget if needfunctionprototypes widget gw endif extern boolean exitworkproc if needfunctionprototypes xtpointer closure endif extern void exitcallback if needfunctionprototypes widget gw xtpointer closure xtpointer call_data endif widget toplevelget gw widget gw    widget to find toplevel    widget top for top gw xtparent

boolean exitworkproc closure xtpointer closure exit 0   notreached   exitcallback add a work procedure that will get call when the application be next idle    which happens after all the event be process and the destroy callback be execute                                                                                                          11  how do i resize a shell widget                                                                                                          after it be realize one resize a shell widget the proper thing be to resize the currently manage child of the shell widget use xtsetvalues the geometry change be then propagate to the shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request however the shell must have the resource xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize to change the position of a shell use xtsetvalues on the shell not the child and within the limit of the window manager it should be grant                                                                                                          12  why xtappaddinput handle file                                                                                                          it do however unix semantics for when i o be ready for a file do not fit most people intuitive model in unix term a file descriptor be ready for reading whenever the read call would not block ignore the set of optional flag that indicate not to block this work a expect for terminal socket and pipe for a file the read will always return but the return indicates an eof    i e no more data the result be the code in the intrinsics always call the input handler because it always think something be about to be read the culprit be the select system call or on sysv base o  s it be the poll system call how to get around this on a unix system the best approach be to use another process to check for available input on the file use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pas the file descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput a suitable program on bsd system be    tail  f filename    rumor that select on some system be not _completely_ reliable in particular ibm aix 3 1 this be one where it would work for a while several thousand time and then stop until some other event woke it up this seem to be the result of a race condition in the kernel ibm claim to have a fix for this pyramid work at all ultrix and possibly others where pipe be implement a socket completely broken but although the write side write in 512 byte block the reading side receive it all broken up a if it be be put into the pipe a byte at a time you can waste a lot of time by reading small block get raound it by detect the situation and have select ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds by then it have be give the whole block note that all the above description use unix terminology such a read file descriptor pipe etc this be an o dependent area and may not be identical on all system however the intrinsic designer felt it be a common enough operation that it should be include with part of the toolkit why they also deal with signal at this point i know

string name long value arg and the code arg arg xtsetarg arg    name    3 2 expands to arg arg arg name    name    arg value 3 2 you can see that with normal c type conversion the arg value get the integer    3    instead of the float point value    3 2    when the value be copy into the widget resource the bit pattern be wildly different than that require for a float point value so how to get around this the follow macro be from the athena widget document and i be now recomending it over the previous suggestion define xtsetfloatarg arg n d if sizeof float sizeof xtargval xtsetarg arg n d else xtargval  ld xtargval d xtsetarg arg n  ld                                                                                                          17  how do i write a resource converter                                                                                                          courtesy of rich thomson rthomson dsd es com the follow discussion of resource converter assumes r4 or r5 intrinsics resource converter change between r3 and r4 to allow for destructors and cache of convert value there be several main type of resource converter string to data type data type to string data type to data type i string to data type usually a string to data type converter have a fix set of string that will be convert to data type value this be most often use to map enumerate name to enumerate value name value    true    1    false    0 in this case the string to data type converter need to compare the resource value to the list of fix string this be most readily accomplish by the use of the    quark    mechanism of the resource manager the resource value be turn into a quark which be a unique representation of the string that fit into a single word then the resource quark be compare against the quark for the fix string represent the enumerate value if there be many enumerate string in the converter or many converter each with a small number of enumeration string then a global initialization routine might be use to turn all the resource string into quark that way the first time one of these converter be use the string will be turn into quark and held in static variable for use in the next invocation of one of the converter ii data type to string this type of converter be slightly easy than the string to data type converter since the use of quark necessary instead the data type value be simply convert to a string value probably by the use of sprintf data type to string converter be useful for application that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file this mechanism can be use to provide a    snapshot    of application state into a file this snapshot can be use to restore the program to a know state via the usual x resource database mechanism if you be take the trouble to write a string to data type converter it much extra effort to write the data type to string converter write both at the same time help to ensure that they be consistent iii data type to data type this type of converter be use to convert an exist data type value to another data type for instance an x pixel value can be convert to an rgb data type that contains separate field for red green and blue the type signature for a resource converter be a follow typedef boolean  xttypeconverter display xrmvalueptr cardinal xrmvalueptr xrmvalueptr xtpointer display  dpy xrmvalueptr args cardinal  num_args xrmvalueptr fromval xrmvalueptr toval xtpointer  converter_data when the converter be invoked the    fromval    argument point to the source x resource manager value and the    toval    argument point to the destination x resource manager value the    converter_data    argument be an opaque pointer to some converter specific data that be specify when the converter be register the    args    and    num_args    argument allow extra information to be pass to the converter when it be invoked for instance the pixel to rgb structure converter discuss above would need colormap and visual argument in which to lookup the pixel to obtain the rgb value correspond to that pixel care must be take with the    toval    argument an xrmvalue have the follow type definition and specifies a size and location for a convert value typedef struct unsigned int size caddr_t addr xrmvalue  xrmvalueptr when the converter be invoked the address may point to a location of the give size for the convert value or the location can be null in the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area be large enough to handle the convert value if the destination area be not large enough then the converter should set the size to the amount of space need and return false the caller can then ensure that enough space be allocate and reinvoke the converter if the size be large enough then the converter can simply copy the convert value into the space give and return true if the location be null then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable contain the convert value and return true when write a group of converter this code be often repeat and it becomes convenient to define a macro define do var type if toval  addr if toval  size sizeof type toval  size sizeof type return false else type toval  addr var else toval  addr caddr_t var toval  size sizeof type return true define donestr str if toval  addr toval  size sizeof string toval  size sizeof string return false else toval  addr caddr_t str toval  size sizeof string return true inside the converter it be a good idea to perform a little safety check on the    num_args    and    args    argument to ensure that your converter be be call properly once you have write your converter you need to register it with the intrinsics the intrinsics invokes resource converter when create widget and fetch their resource value from the resource database to register a converter with a single application context use xtappsettypeconverter void xtappsettypeconverter context from to converter args num_args cache destructor xtappcontext context string from string to xttypeconverter converter xtconvertarglist args cardinal num_args xtcachetype cache xtdestructor destructor to register a converter with all application context use xtsettypeconverter void xtsettypeconverter from to converter args num_args cache destructor string from string to xttypeconverter converter xtconvertarglist args cardinal num_args xtcachetype cache xtdestructor destructor in the r3 intrinsics there be the routine xtappaddconverter and xtaddconverter these have be supersede by xtappsettypeconverter and xtsettypeconverter whenever possible the newer routine should be use when a converter be register with the intrinsics a    cache    argument specifies how convert resource value be to be cached xtcachenone cache any convert value xtcacheall cache all convert value xtcachebydisplay cache convert value on a per display basis cache convert value that require a round trip to the server be a good idea for instance string to pixel conversion the    destructor    argument be a routine that be invoked then the resource be destroyed either because it cached reference count have be decremented to zero or because the widget own the value be be destroyed xtdestructor have the follow type definition typedef void  xtdestructor xtappcontext xrmvalueptr xtpointer xrmvalueptr cardinal xtappcontext context xrmvalueptr to xtpointer converter_data xrmvalueptr args cardinal  num_args the destructor be invoked to free any auxiliary storage associate with the    to    argument but do not actually free the storage point to by the    to    argument itself to  addr the destructor be pass the extra argument that be pass to the converter when the conversion be perform for instance colormap and visual argument for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocate pixel from the colormap a well a the private data pass in when the converter be register sample converter code can be found in the follow file in the mit r5

resource issue 3 summer 1992 by oliver jones for a complete coverage of the issue involve most of this answer be base on that article in a nutshell one us xtopendisplay to add each display to a _single_ application context and then xtclosedisplay to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context the real problem occur when try to close down a display this can happen 3 way 1  user selects a    quit    button on one of the display 2  user have window manager send a wm_delete_window message 3  server disconnect    possibly from a killclient message server shutdown crash or network failure i  ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 2 since it be _merely_ a problem of translate a widget to a display and remove that display if not then read the oliver jones article the third one be difficult to handle the follow be base on the oliver jones article and i include it here because it be a difficult problem the difficulty arises because the xlib design presume that an i o error be always unrecoverable and so fatal this be essentially true for a single display x base application but not true for a multiple display program or an application that do thing other than display information on an x server when an x i o error occurs the i o error handler be call and _if_ it return then an exit happens the only way around this be to use setjmp longjmp to avoid return to the i o error handler the follow code fragment demonstrates this include setjmp h jmp_buf xiorecover void xiohandler dpy display  dpy destroydisplay dpy longjmp xiorecover 1 main     if setjmp xiorecover    0 xsetioerrorhandler xiohandler xtappmainloop app_context the destroydisplay be something that give a display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup it should also call xtclosedisplay for those of you unfamiliar with setjmp longjmp when setjmp be first call it return a 0 and save  s enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp can return the program to the same state a if the setjmp be just execute the return value of this second setjmp be the value of the second argument to longjmp there be several caveat about use these but for this purpose it be adequate some other problem you might run into be resource converter that improperly cache resource the most likely symptom be xlib error such a badcolor badatom or badfont there may be problem with the total number of display you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptor be available with 32 be a typical value you may also run into authorization problem when try to connect to a display there be much discussion in comp windows x about this topic in november of 91  robert scheifler post an article which basically say this be the way it will be and xlib will not change                                                                                                          19  what change from r3 to r4 to r5

args pass at creation time 2  command line argument 3  user  s per host default file 4  user  s default file 5  user  s per application default file 6  system wide per application default file note that 2 6 be read only once on application startup the result of step 3 6 be a single resource database use for far query the per host default file contains customizations for all application execute on a specific computer this file be either specify with the xenvironment environment variable or if that be not set then the file home  xdefaults  host be use the user default file be either obtain from the resource_manager property on the root window of the display or if that be not set then the file home  xdefaults be use typically the program    xrdb    be use to set the resource_manager property please note that this should be kept relatively small a each client that connects to the display must transfer the property a size of around 1 3kbyte be reasonable some toolkits may track change to the resource_manager but most do not a user may have many per application default file contain customizations specific to each application the intrinsics be quite flexible on how this file be found read the next part that describes the various environment variable and how they effect where this file be found the system wide per application default file be typically found in  usr lib x11 app defaults if such a file be not found then the fallback resource be use the intrinsics be quite flexible on how this file be found read the next part that describes the various environment variable and how they effect where this file be found thanks to oliver jones oj pictel com for the follow 6 92 you can use several environment variable to control how resource be load for your xt based program    xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environment variable control where xt look for application defaults file a an application be initialize xt load at most one app defaults file from the path define in xfilesearchpath and another from the path define in xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath if software be instal on your system in such a way that app defaults file appear in several different directory hierarchy suppose for example that you be run sun  s open window and you also have some r4 x application instal in  usr lib x11 app defaults you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up app defaults file in both  usr lib x11 and  usr openwin lib or wherever your openwinhome be locate setenv xfilesearchpath  usr lib x11  t  n openwinhome lib  t  n the value of this environment variable be a colon separated list of pathnames the pathnames contain replacement character a follow see xtresolvepathname n the value of the filename parameter or the application  s class name t the value of the file    type    in this case the literal string    app defaults    c customization resource r5 only s suffix none for app defaults l language locale and codeset e g    ja_jp euc    l language part of l e g    ja    t the territory part of the display  s language string c the codeset part of the display  s language string let  s take apart the example suppose the application  s class name be    myterm    also suppose open window be instal in  usr openwin notice the example omits locale specific lookup  usr lib x11  t  n mean  usr lib x11 app defaults myterm openwinhome lib  t  n mean  usr openwin lib app defaults myterm a the application initializes xt try to open both of the above app defaults file in the order show a soon a it find one it read it and us it and stop look for others the effect of this path be to search first in  usr lib x11 then in  usr openwin let  s consider another example this time let  s set xuserfilesearchpath so it look for the file myterm ad in the current work directory then for myterm in the directory   app defaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath n ad home app defaults  n the first path in the list expands to   myterm ad the second expands to home app defaults myterm this be a convenient set for debug because it follow the imake convention of name the app defaults file myterm ad in the application  s source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you be work and still have the resource load properly note when look for app default file with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix be define so t and s be useless with r5 there  s another twist you may specify a customization resource value for example you might run the    myterm    application like this myterm  xrm     customization  color    if one of your pathname specification have the value     usr lib x11 app defaults  n c    then the expand pathname would be     usr lib x11 app defaults myterm color    because the c substitution character take on the value of the customization resource the default xfilesearchpath compile into xt be  usr lib x11  l  t  n c r5  usr lib x11  l  t  n c r5  usr lib x11  t  n c r5  usr lib x11  l  t  n  usr lib x11  l  t  n  usr lib x11  t  n note some site replace  usr lib x11 with a projectroot in this batch of default setting the default xuserfilesearchpath also compile into xt be root l  n c r5 root l  n c r5 root n c r5 root l  n root l  n root n root be either the value of xapplresdir or the user  s home directory if xapplresdir be not set if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether notice that the quick and dirty way of make your application find your app defaults file in your current work directory be to set xapplresdir to       a single dot in r3 all this machinery work differently for r3 compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to       a dot follow by a slash                                                                                                          21  what order be callback execute in

an order this be because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire content of the callback list neither one currently know what the other be do and so the intrinsics can not guarantee the order of execution the application programmer can not rely on the widget writer the widget writer be not require to document when the widget will add and remove callback from the list or what effect this will have therefore the functionality contain in a callback should be independent of the functionality contain in other callback on the list even though the xt standard in the definition of xtaddcallback    callback_name specifies the callback list to which the procedure be to be append    you may not infer from the word    append    that the callback routine be call in the same order a they have be add to the callback list                                                                                                          22  how do i know if

everything be implement correctly this demonstrates a    deficiency    in the x protocol and the core widget be reflect the capability of the protocol the    deficiency    be that the information be available in one way in this case an inconvenient way the xt specification be accurate in the second and third paragraph of section 7 10 2 so read this section carefully the visible field will not change in response to iconification a visibilitynotify event will not be receive when the window go from viewable to unviewable that be when the widget or an ancestor be unmapped that be when iconification occurs this be the protocol deficiency visibility state and viewable state have specific meaning in the x protocol see the glossary in your xlib and x protocol reference manual see this with any window manager with no window manager a an application writer keep track with a global boolean in an action routine with translation for mapnotify and unmapnotify on the shell widget which contains your custom widget a the custom widget writer see the map_state field return by a call to xgetwindowattributes these be suggestion

                                                   unfortunately most code that call malloc realloc or calloc tends to ignore the possibility of return null at best it be handle something like ptr type malloc sizeof type if ptr perror    malloc in xyzzy    exit 1 to handle this common case the intrinsics define the function xtmalloc xtcalloc xtnew xtnewstring and xtrealloc which all use the standard c language function malloc calloc and realloc but execute xterrormsg if a null value be return xt error handler be not suppose to return so this effectively exit in addition if xtrealloc be call with a null pointer it us xtmalloc to get the initial space this allows code like if ptr ptr type malloc sizeof type else ptr type realloc ptr sizeof type count 1   count to be write a ptr xtrealloc ptr sizeof ptr   count also xtfree accepts a null pointer a an argument generally found the xt function conveniant to use however anytime allocate anything potentially large i use the

be a great package for trace memory problem on sun  s a bit pricey at 2750 but still recomend it excuse the marketing blurb contact support pure com for more info purify insert additional check instruction directly into the object code produce by exist compiler these instruction check every memory read and write perform by the program under test and detect several type of access error such a reading unitialized memory write past malloc  d bound or write to freed memory purify insert check logic into all of the code in a program include third party and vendor object code library and verifies system call interface in addition purify track memory usage and identifies individual memory leak use a novel adaption of garbage collection technique purify  s nearly comprehensive memory access check slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five an alternative package that a pricey 395 for a sun run on many unix  s and have pretty similar feature be    the sentinel debug environment    this replaces malloc and several other c library function to add additional check contact cpcahil virtech vti com for more info next if you be get any sort of xlib error need to run in synchronous mode easily accomplish with the     sync    command line argument or by set the variable xdebug to 1 with your debugger then set a break point in exit this will let you trace back to the original xlib function be call if you run in synchronous mode then the actual error may have occur any number of call to xlib previously since the xlib call be buffer and reply from the server be asynchronous next if you be have trouble with window layout you can use the undocumented resource    xtidentifywindows    or the class resource    xtdebug    to cause the widget name to be identify with each window for example example xload  xrm   xtdebug true example xwininfo  tree click in new xload window will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window be include this can help for check the location and size of errant widget next if you be have trouble with geometry manager or you want to test the way a widget manages child you can try export lcs mit edu contrib libxtgeo tar z this act a a filter between any child and a geometry manager and check the behaviour of both a very clever idea the most unfortunate problem be debug a callback while the application be execute a grab of the keyboard or mouse such a from a pulldown menu the server effectively lock up and need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually the server lock up because the application be debug have say no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application be not stop wait because the debugger be wait for your command unfortunately you give them because all the input be go to your application which be stop the best way to debug this kind of problem be with two machine on your desk run the program under a debugger or other environment on one machine and run the application on the other possibly use a command sequence like this othermachine xhost  thismachine thismachine setenv display othermachine 0 thismachine gdb application your favorite debugger or this othermachine xhost  thismachine thismachine gdb application gdb set environment display othermachine 0 gdb run     i believe codecenter a c interpreter graphical debugger have a method of deal with this by explicitely call the xlib function to release any grab during breakpoints debug widget problem require pretty good debug skill and knowledge of how widget work you can go a long way without know the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understand how a widget work judicious use of conditional breakpoints and add print statement with the debugger help a great deal                                                                                                          26  why xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc work                                                                                                          i have get a delicate problem with the three routine xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc the problem i have be that when i use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly i have make a handy little testprogram where everything work perfect but in my    real    application nothing happens the introduction in r3 of the xtapp  function obsoleted those routine see q19 for other change in r3 r4 and r5 what happens be they use a default application context different then the one you may have create since event and timeouts be distribute on a per application context basis and you be use two application context you get those event for example     cnt 0 toplevel xtappinitialize app class desc xtnumber desc argc argv fallback args cnt xtaddtimeout     xtaddworkproc     xtappmainloop app would never invoke the timeout                                                                                                          27  what be and how can i implement drag and drop                                                                                                          courtesy of roger reynolds rogerr netcom com 19 feb 93 drag n drop be a buzzword for move data between client in an    intuitive    fashion motif version 1 2 support drag n drop capability openlook have support d n d all along the two protocol be not compatable with each other and so far a i know they be not publish i write a package call rdd which be design to be a flexible public protocol for do drag n drop operation between client my intention be to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a    standard    drag n drop protocol in the program they develop and contribute or sell regardless of what widget set be use a long a it be base on xt the implementation be base upon my understand of the icccm convention for more detail read the code i have heard from dozen of people use rdd who like it and feel that it work a whole lot well than motif 1 2 stuff also there seem to be many who think that it be neat but be constrain to use motif anyway the late rdd and some other stuff be available for ftp from netcom com in  pub rogerr a possibly old version be also available on export lcs mit edu in  contrib
 i specifically make the above comment assume that perhaps the code fragment come from a simple    open draw quit    client a per your question why not have the button handler add the object and then call the    window_redraw    or whatever directly although depend on how the overall application be structure there may be no problem with render the object directly in response to the button press ken
 have anyone have experience port imake to do use a microsoft watcom or any other do compiler
 i be work on a problem of schedule classroom and i will like to know if you have some software paper or article about it if you have something relate it please let me know thanks
 be use it for a year on unix sun and hp and window platform in my opinion it be the best toolkit on the market it support a rich api to a high level ipc mechanism file system abstraction memory management command driven application development draw geometry management and oh yeah open look motif ms windows and mac at the flip of a switch
 i need probably to write one or more new motif widget on the hp ux platform do i need the motif private header file and source or can i make do with the public header that be provide    motif    include xt in this context yes find it almost impossible without the source at this point it do depend on how ambitious you be and how concerned you be about compliance with the general interface and item like traversal one widget be a multi column list which lot of people have already write i be sure and would therefore be probably be a subclass of list rather than something simple like an xt class be this more difficult in principle not line of code not sure what ask you could create something which be very much like a true multi column list by place several list within a geometry manager and put that manager within an automatic scroll window this be good for very large list but you might consider this a an alternative alternatively if anyone have a multi column list widget they could sell me this might save me from have to write one do it by any chance exist in motif 1 2 already i do not yet have the spec motif 1 2 do not have a multi column list in it have you look at commercial set there be also some pd widget set one of these might have a multi column list you could port
 i need to write an application which do annotation note on exist document the annotation could be do several time by different people the idea be something like have several acetate transparency stack on top of each other so that the user can see through all of them see something like this be do by the oclock client could someone please tell me how to do it in xt thank you very much

 dear xperts develop an application that us a motif slider to select an image file out of a directory now i would like to display the name of the file correspond to the value of the drag scale button i e with the mb1 press a xmnshowvalue only display the current value of the scale button and not the actual correspond image file name i thought of use an xtaddeventhandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name xtaddeventhandler scaleimage button1motionmask false slidermoved null and in the eventhandler do a while xchecktypedwindowevent display event  window motionnotify return xmscalegetvalue scaleimage value   map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open   however when i move the pointer in the scale widget i get callback with of co urse a null effect a my mb1 be not press to move the scale button so what be goin g wrong or be the a wrong approach to this problem any hint be highly appreciate

x an entry be usually examine in a number of way we typically apply x a number of test to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignore

other hand give x two such entry we be more inclined to pick the entry that x do something interest when you run it x x we try to avoid limit creativity in our rule a such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation a in real life x program interpret a requirement document or a customer request x be important for this reason we often award  worst abuse of the x rule to an entry

attempt to exploit them we will award  worst abuse of the rules  x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the small plug need if not small x x check out your program and be

because they work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claim that x 16 be a prime number if you do have a bug you be well off x document it note    this entry sometimes print the

do mass of defines to obscure the source have become  old we x tend to  see thru mass of defines due to our pre processor test x that we apply simply abuse defines or  dfoo bar go a far x a a program that be more well round in confusion x x many ansi c compiler dislike the follow code and so do we x x define d define x d foo    expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j    use such implicit

compiler x x unfortunately some ansi c compiler require array index to be of x integral type thus the follow classical obfuscation hack should x not be use in 1993  this rule may be relaxed in future contest x x int i x char  c x i c    use c i instead x i 3    string       use    string    i 3 instead x x if your entry us function that have a variable number of x argument be careful system implement va_list a a wide variety x of way because of this a number of operation use va_list be x not portable and must not be use x x assign a non va_list variable to from a va_list variable x cast a non va_list variable into from a va_list variable x passing a va_list variable to a function expect a non va_list arg x passing a non va_list variable to a function expect a va_list arg x perform arithmetic on va_list variable x use va_list a a structure or union x x in particular do not treat va_list variable a if they be a char     s x x avoid use varargs h use stdarg h instead x x if you use c preprocessor directive define if ifdef     x the lead must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the lead many do not x x because the exit function return void on some system entry x must not assume that it return an int x x small program be best when they be short obscure and concise x while such program be not a complex a other winner they do x serve a useful purpose they be often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for x program that be compact and be instructional x x one line program should be short one line program say around 80 x byte long get close to 160 byte be a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike program that x x be very hardware specific x be very o or un x version specific x index strchr difference be ok but socket streams specific x code be likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warning x it be ok only if you warn u in the  remark header item x compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abuse the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x be longer than they need to be x be similar to previous winner x be identical to previous loser x x unless you be cramped for space or unless you be enter the x  best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply form excessively long line x x the build file should not be use to try and get around the size x limit it be one thing to make use of a several  d  s to help out x but it be quite another to use 200  byte of  d  s in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you be well off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allow whitespace and in certain case or do not impact x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that be simply a compact blob of character x x give two version of the same program one that be a compact blob x of code and the other that be format more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that be format in an interest x and or obfuscate way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid try for the  smallest self replicating  x program we be amaze at the many different size that claim x to be the small there be nothing wrong with self replicating x program in fact a number of winner have be self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of  smallest l we or others x know of a small one x x x client entry should be a portable a possible entry that x adapt to a wide collection of environment will be favor x depend on a particular type of display for example depend x on color or a give size require backing store x x x client entry should avoid use x related library and x software that be not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entry restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set libx11 a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone x have them avoid depend on a particular window manager not x everyone have x11r5 and some people be stuck back in x11r4 or x earlier so try to target x11r5 without require x11r5 well x yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window system x x x client entry should not to depend on particular item on x  xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the require line x in the     remark    section x x we like program that x x be a concise and small a they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pas lint without complaint not a requirement but it be nice x be portable x be unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different type of obfuscation x make u laugh and or throw up x x some type of program excel in some area of course your x program have to excel in all area but do well in several x area really do help x x we freely admit that interest creative or humorous comment in x the     remark    section help your chance of win if you have to x read of many twist entry you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the reader of the contest winner do a well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help u process the many entry we must request your x assistance by format your entry in a certain way this format x in addition allows u to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself see judging

they be declare winner at the start of the final round x we will invent award category for them if necessary x x in the final round process we perform the difficult task of x reduce the remain entry typically about 25 down to 8 or 10 x winner often we be confident that the entry that make it into x the final round be definitely well than the one that do not x make it the selection of the winner out of the final round be x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but be beat out x by a similar but slightly well entry for this reason it be x sometimes worthwhile to

entry usually one line a x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuse the contest x rule in some way x x in the end we traditionally pick one entry a  best sometimes such x an entry simply

 imho this whole discussion name    motif look like ms windogs    be totally stupid the only thing remotely influence here can be the motif window manager that feature an arrangement of button and menu somewhat similiar to this of the ms w windowmanaging agent however it name be but mwm be only a small part of motif in fact mwm and motif can work without each other and if one like mwms outfit for some reason he switch to another windowmanager all this influence motif which be a toolkit of widget to write application and this toolkit be imho uncomparable to ms w because it be much more wellorganized and feature alot of goody more than the ms w interface you can not say    a porsche look like a vw k xc3 xa4fer    only because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position motif and ms w be complete different world only one element of the motif world have some gear and wheel at the same position a ms w

 i use xwd and xwd2ps to do it from within a program i use xwd  id xxxxx where xxxxx be the window id obtain from xtwindow widget
 there be a widget already define for gl it be the glxmdraw motif or glxdraw athena widget it be similar to a xmdrawingarea except that it allows you to use gl call to render into the window look at glxlink glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man page the glxmdraw widget work pretty well opengl will be an improvement i think gl be a little easy to use and a little more powerful but just an opinion mileage may vary

price at only 250 our aim this year have be to reduce the price for disk which can be produce inexpensively but to continue to supply a much value added a possible to accomplish this we will be put

gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation fault when run x  note first that gcc on risc machine do not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly be not a noticeable a it be on the 680x0 or vax platform here be the problem gcc and cc use incompatible method of passing structure a argument and return them a function value so when gcc compiled part of x be link with sun supplied function that pas or return structs run time error occur affected program include rgb and the server this be from the gcc manual on the sparc gnu cc us an incompatible call convention for structure it pass them by include their content in the argument list whereas the standard compiler pass them effectively by reference this really ought to be fix but such call convention be not yet support in gnu cc so it straightforward to fix it the convention for structure return be also incompatible and  fpcc struct return do not help you can duck the problem either by use cc throughout or by use it for just the routine which cause incompatibility the problem can not be solve with compilation flag file which need to be compile use cc include server os 4 2bsd oscolor c rgb rgb c in addition several of the    inet_    function use structs a args or return value clients xhost xhost c clients xauth gethost c call to inet_addr in  lib clx socket c and lib x xconndis c

extension the shape extension will only run on a server which support it pre x11r4 server a well a many vendor supplied server do not support the shape extension in which case they will display rectangular window anyway in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library libxext a in the x11r4 distribution this library and the associate include will be in the mit extensions directory if you do not have these file do not despair many freeware program which use the shape extension can also be compile without it by remove the  dshape define from the makefile you can

compare a _xtinherit be this be handle by put _xtinherit in the same file a a function that be always use thereby guarantee that it would be load    that be in initialize c where xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routine would normally be call you be probably see this error because your program be not a normal xt based program and do not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere 1 it may be a program that us xt function but never open a connection to the x server osf motif  s 1 1 0 uil have this problem it call xtmalloc and other xt function the solution be to add the call to your program the function do not have to be execute just link in 2 alternatively your program need any xt function and be correct in not call xttoolkitinitialize    it may be an xlib or xview program in this case you can remove  lxt from your link command it should not be necessary to link the share library statically although this will certainly solve the problem from jordan hayes now jordan

xsetwmhints dpy window wmhints if your application be base on the xt intrinsics you can set the xtninput resource to be true a you probably want to in any case if you have source you can start up the application with the resource   input true certain window manager notably dxwm and olwm be very picky about have this do if you be use sun  s openwindows olwm you can also add this resource to your default file to use client that icccm compliant openwindows focuslenience true mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart mark of sun                                                                                                          subject 114 how do i figure out what window manager be run you reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case for most case you care which window manager be run so long a you do thing in an icccm conformant manner there be some case in which particular window manager be know to do thing wrong check for particular hint place on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these case alternatively it may be appropriate to determine which window manager be run in order to take advantage of specific  added  feature such a olwm  s push pin menu in order to give your program  added  functionality beware of usurp the window manager  s function by provide that functionality even when it be miss this surely lead to future compatibility problem                                                                                                          subject 115 be there a skeleton x program available there be no general framework such a the transskel program for the macintosh which handle lot of the odds and end and overhead of development under a window system and which can be use a a platform for additional development in x the problem be typically solve by use an interactive application builder tool or by use cut paste on exist x application good application which you might look to manipulate when you want to    test just this one little thing    include contrib clients xskel a simple r4 program that put up a window and allows sketch in it and offer a start point for quick hack the xaw example in the examples  directory in the r3 and r4 distribution and the xlib    hello world    example in the r3 doc helloworld and r4 doc tutorials helloworld an

                                                           subject 116 why do xtgetvalues not work for me sic the xtgetvalues interface for retrieve resource from a widget be sensitive to the type of variable your code may be do something like this arg args 3 int i int sensitive    oops wrong data type    i 0 xtsetarg args i xtnsensitive sensitive i   xtgetvalues widget args i     but xtnsensitive be a boolean which on most machine be a single byte declare the variable    sensitive    a boolean work properly this problem come up often when use particular toolkits that redefine the xt type dimension and position code that assumes they be int will have similar problem if those type be actually short in general you be safe if you use the actual type of the resource a it appear in the widget  s man page 11 90                                                                                                          subject 117 why xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work probably try to use these function from application code they should be use only internally to widget these function be for a parent widget to change the geometry of it child other promising function xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest be also for use only by widget in this case by a child to request a change from it parent the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget be to issue an xtsetvalues call set some of the geometry resource although this will result in the widget internal function be call your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the widget data become corrupt the xlib call xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be avoid they be use to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight                                                                                                          subject 118 why there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow although there be various detail of the current implementation of the xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists be that it remains undefined what the set of resource for the    new    widget should be resource be typically set base on the location in the instance hierarchy what resource should change if the instance move what should happen to the widget  s child and by the time such semantics be define there would probably be little advantage over destroy the old widget and create a new widget in the correct location with the desire resource a set the resource correctly be the majority of work in create a new widget note that reparenting be possible in the oi toolkit                                                                                                          david b  lewis

 no doubt this be an old question but i find the answer in the faq i could find so here go i have a sunview application that i want to convert to x openlook motiv whatever i remember hearing quite some time ago that there be tool to accomplish this task a be that so b be they public domain c any good i e d advantage over reimplementing the interface myself thanks
 i post about this a while ago but without code excerpt noone be able to help me the problem be that main_win win be do fine but when i create detail_win win it do not receive initial expose event until main_win win receives an event here be the relevent call main_win win xcreatesimplewindow mydisplay defaultrootwindow mydisplay myhint x myhint y myhint width myhint height main_win line_thick fg bg xsetstandardproperties mydisplay main_win win main_win text main_win text none argv argc myhint main_win gc xcreategc mydisplay main_win win 0 0 xmapraised mydisplay detail_win win xmapsubwindows mydisplay main_win win the event mask for main_win be pposition psize structurenotifymask exposuremask  keypressmask enterwindowmask leavewindowmask the flag be pposition psize i then create detail_win win with the follow call hint have new value detail_win win xcreatesimplewindow mydisplay defaultrootwindow mydisplay myhint x myhint y myhint width myhint height detail_win line_thick fg bg xsetstandardproperties mydisplay main_win win detail_win text detail_win text none argv argc myhint detail_win gc xcreategc mydisplay detail_win win 0 0 xmapraised mydisplay detail_win win event mask and flag be identical to main_win  s flag and event mask if anybody have any idea why the initial expose event of detail_win win be not receive until main_win win receives an event love to hear from them other that that everything work great so there must be some detail oversee thanks for any tip    robert rgasch nl oracle com

 work on an x11r5 application and have concern regard standard colormaps these colormaps    i wonder what window manager the writer have in mind neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps however xstdcmap seem to try very hard to avoid conflict with the default colormap when i use standard colormaps create by xstdcmap the rest of my display go black so it seem a if use of standard colormaps cause the very problem standard colormaps be intend to avoid perhaps if every application use standard colormaps thing would be wonderful but not many application seem to use standard colormaps finally the operation of the function xmugetcolormapallocation xmustandardcolormap and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsistent with the section 14 3 of the x11r5 xlib documentation accord to the section 14 3 of the x11r5 xlib documentation p  436 for grayscale colormaps only the colormap red_max red_mult and base_pixel member be define the other member be ignore to compute a grayscale pixel value use the follow expression gray red_mult base_pixel 0xffffffff xmugetcolormapallocation define in mit lib xmu cmapalloc c be use by xmulookupstandardcolormap define in mit lib xmu lookupcmap c to select red_max green_max and blue_max value for the call to xmustandardcolormap when the rgb_gray_map property be specify xmugetcolormapallocation set red_max to 30 of the total number of cell in the gray scale set green_max to 59 of the total number and set blue_max ot 11 of the total number refer to section 14 3 one would expect xmugetcolormapallocation to set red_max to the total number of cell in the gray scale when the rgb_gray_map property be specify xmustandardcolormap define in mit lib xmu stdcmap c set red_mult green_mult and blue_mult all equal to 1  refer to section 14 3 one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignore
 i think the original post be search for exist implementation of f i gouroud shading of triangle this be fairly complex to do with plain x  simpler shade model be implement already f i in x3d ask archie where to get the late version for gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilize some extension only either mit shm to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it or pex opengl which should be able to shade themselves the portable  vanilla x way would be to shade in a normal ximage and use xputimage what would be good enough to do static thing a f i fractal landscape or such stuff to speak about povray the x previewer that come with the original source package be not that good especially in speed protocol friendlyness and icccm compliance have a look on x256q my own preview code it be on 141 76 1 11 pub gfx ray misc x256q  the readme state the point where it be well than xwindow c from povray 1 0
 write an application run under x use motif and i need to do some stuff when the application quits now when i shut down my x window session it seem to send a sigterm or whatever signal to my application trap various signal like that therefore i thought i could use an x signal to check for my top level window be destroyed however i seem to get destroynotify event whenever i move window be there any way for me to check that the window be actually be destroyed some field to check or some combination of event reply by e mail please and i will summarise thanks for any help ian

 a colleague have a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation when he first log on via xdm he have a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager run in this configuration x window application particularly xdvi work fine however if he open up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi can not start in either window give the error unable to load iso 8859 1 font the only difference between the two xterm window be that the initial one reference a different name in the xsession file with prettier colour and other slight change far investigation show that only opening a default xterm cause this behaviour and more significant all x application can no longer load any font if they be invoked from the command line in either window if i start the xterm with a different font use the  fn option no problem it would seem that the default xterm be load a font which somehow cause the server to lose all of it font note xlsfonts in either window show all of the font available so there appear to be a problem in the font directories hash tables other than rewrite the xterm app defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best do anyone have any idea

 actually info qdeck com be our customer service department if you have technical question you can write to support qdeck com i expect the limit factor will be your server machine not the network itself to give you a real world example here at quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people use dvx to talk to a bunch of unix box novell file server and each other not _too_ much of a load on our ethernet with maybe 4 concentrators so you have 20 30 people on each segment if you have a badly load net or the apps you want to run be very network intensive you could run into some slowdown but the big problem would be the machine itself say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have 10 people run program off it go to see some slowdown because now on effectively a 3 3 mhz 486  of course dvx will attempt to see if task be idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have 10 work program run know it have say that if you can tweak the program be run by add in call to give up time slice when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run 15 20 people on a give machine before you start see slowdown again this time from network bandwidth it all really depends on what the program be do ie go to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps be all do network thing also
 i find this thread on motif accelerator absoultly amaze if i be write an interface to keyboard accelerator i would have one resource call    accelerator    that take a translation table period i would also implement it so that programmer never have to do any work to get the accelerator instal a soon a the end user specify one it would be active and automatically instal to get multiple accelerator on a single menu item do something like  menuitem accelerators override   n   ctrl key m fire   n   shift key l fire   n the accelerator would work exactly like translation and you would automatically see a    ctrl m    show up in your menuitem object why in the world be the motif stuff so complicate with so many different special case depend on what type of widget deal with there have to be some reason sorry for the political tone of this message

 lucky dog     it applies with equal force to earlier version presumably only recently do the author s decide it be important enough to mention the necessity it refers to have always be there but be implicit in the way createwindow request default some attribute of the new window     this be because the warn you read be incomplete you have to provide not only a colormap but also a border the default border be copyfromparent which be not valid when the window  s depth match it parent  s specify a border pixmap of the correct depth or a border pixel and the problem should go away there be another problem i find anything to indicate that copyfromparent make any sense a the border_width parameter to xcreatewindow your xlib implementation probably defines copyfromparent a zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you be unwittingly ask for a border width of zero due to the xlib implementation not provide stricter type checking to be fair not entirely certain possible for xlib to catch this der mouse

 hey guy i work on many station and would like this name and current logname to be in a title of xterm when open and a machine name only when close in other word i want host and logname to appear a a title of open xterm and host when xterm be close how can i do it apology if answer something already answer in the faq our news feed have be lose a lot of article lately so i see the faq lately to check two way 1 when you start the xterm you can use command line option  n icon_name to set the icon label  t window_title to set the window title  title window_title equivalent to  t window_title 2 you can use escape sequence to change thing on the fly the basic escape sequence be esc p some_arbitary_text bel where esc and bel be the ascii escape and bell character p be an ascii decimal digit    2 1 or 0 depend on whether you be try to set the window or icon title or both and some_arbitary_text be your desire label string hence this command will set the window icon title echo      033 0 your_title_goes_here  007  c    to set just the icon title echo      033 1 your_title_goes_here  007  c    to set just the window title echo      033 2 your_title_goes_here  007  c    of course you may have to fiddle with exact syntax depend on how the echo command work on your system and what shell you be use show system v semantics under bourne or korn shell hint for sun o user use  usr 5bin echo instead of  bin echo or csh  s built in echo otherwise have to embed literal esc and bel character in the string instead of use convenient octal sequence if you want your titlebar update continously say to show your current directory hostname or somesuch then have to see if you can coerce your shell into spit out the appropriate escape sequence when it prompt for command sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence in the prompt string itself sometimes not

 i might have a need in the future to display rotate text i notice the    xvertext    package on the net it look very good but it have one slight problem the api to it assumes you have a font name not an already load font it be too difficult to split up the function into two interface routine one with a font name and one with an xfontstruct but i thought i would ask the author alan richardson mppa3 uk ac sussex syma first in case he be planning this already unfortunately his email address bounce do alan r  or the current maintainer of    xvertext    see this the e mail address you mention above be for use with the u k  a you know the brit do everything backwards so the real address from the state be mppa3 syma sussex ac uk give it a try
 xdm do xgrabserver when run in secure mode so do some screen locks there  s really no simple way to tell this be the case you can take xdm out of secure mode probably not too cool you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal handler an example of this can be see in the xdm source
     let me point out that both gui based word processors and text based formatters both have a language one happens to be mouse  and action based and the other symbol based true but beside the point this be a fact about an abstract model of what the gui user be do not about what they actually  are  do this abstract model be only apparent from the perpective of a  programmer  of the system nb some user may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start think like a programmer not say that the programmer  s perspective be evil or stunt after all what i do too i be say that ui designer must carefully distinguish between the user programmer conceptual model and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system i recall the actual stats but something like 1 in 5 people can be categorize a a    symbol manipulator    it would be interest to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim at any rate i think this be evidence that 20 of user think like programmer banker financial analyst structural engineer    these be all people whose work you could characterize a primarily symbol manipulation but what they do be not program and program be not require to do what they do

 if i understand your problem correctly you want to have a way to send exposure to your manager widget when your app specific code draw xlib graphic on the window it sound like you might want to send an exposure use xsendevent and specify a region if you know the region you need to send the exposure generally you have the bound rectangle of the object you can use xcreateregion to create a region xunionrectwithregion to add the new object polygon to the region and then either use the region to clip your gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of your other object need to be redrawn keep in mind that the stack order of overlap object affect how they look hope it help    brian dealy  301 572 8267  it not know where at dealy kong gsfc nasa gov important know uunet dftsrv kong dealy where not at     b dylan
 the short answer seem to be    i    the particular package wscrawl seem to reset  all  it default if  any  of them be miss from the  xdefaults file once i add the miss one to the  xdefaults file the problem go away  kevin
 i have heard of two package for the pc that support x win the first be linux which be a free unix package the second be x appeal which sound pretty good it can be found at garbo uwusa fi in the  ftp pc demo  dir the file be xap13exe zip xap10fon zip drivers zip this should get you start josh
 be there any vendor support pressure sensitive tablet pen with x i will appreciate any pointer thanks sanjay
 have anyone see source to an xterm package ready to perform unisys 22403 terminal emulation get a clunker     and     get a connect return mikell cactus org
 appreciate any feedback on capture playback tool for use with x client any comparisons comments on regression test tool would be great particularly xtm xrunner autotester and sri  s capbak smart and exdiff how about start where i could find any of these for the commercial one at least a phone number would be appreciate
 2nd post of the question that just seem to get answer suppose you have an idle app with a realize and mapped window that contains xlib graphic a button widget when press will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handle    regular    expose event e g window manager driven exposure take care of render the new image use an expose event handler be a    proper    way to do this because at the time the handler be call the xlib window be guaranteed to be mapped the problem of course be that no expose event be generate if the window be already visible and mapped what we need to do be somehow    tickle    the window so that the expose handler be hit with argument that will enable it to render  just  the part of the window that contains the new item
 accord to the osf motif style guide one should use cursor shape to give the user a visual clue of what be happen or what be expect of him so a    hourglass    cursor should be show when the application be busy or a    caution    cursor should be show over an area when input be expect in another define cursor for widget have to be do at rather low level so define a cursor for all widget in an application but not for a certain subpart of it be a rather complicate matter when cursor have be define for some window e g a    crosswire    cursor for a drawingarea thing get even more complicate my intuition say that thing should be easy but be this so if anyone have a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me know the topic on    busy cursor    in the several faq  s be not helpful since they only work for application where all window have the cursor window attribute set to  none
 hi can someone please give me some pointer to set up imake in a sun openwindows enviornment checked through all the documentation but can not find any clue please respons via e mail        thanks paul
 i have look through the faq section and have not see a answer for this i have an x motif application that i have write i have a couple of gif file or pict that i have scan in with a color scanner now i would like to be able to convert the gif file into a format that could be read into my application and displayed on the background of it main window preferably with pixmaps or perhaps a an ximage i have found function in the pbmplus program suite to convert gif to xbm but that be monochrome and i really do need color i have look at xv which read in gif and writes out several format but have not found a way to write out a file which can be read in a a pixmap be there an easy way to do this email response prefer thanks  mark ahlenius rtsg mot com

 again poseted for a friend okay i get such great response from my last question thanks everyone let try again how can i tell if a colorcell be read only i want to use any read only cell that be already in my colormap once i start run out of allocatable cell use some arbitrary near color match scheme to get those cell that come closest to a request color once i determine if a cell be read only i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor with the exact same color specification and it will then be flag a  used by my application so that it later get freed by someone else and allocate again a read write to another application so far the only way figure out to do this be to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cell color once my colormap be all full up it should error out if the cell be non shareable but life would be much easy if i could just detect the read only shareable stuff directly     any idea
 i be try to build and use imake x11r4 on an ibm rs 6000 run aix v3 2 i be have the follow 2 problem 1 many of my imakefile  s have contructs like      this be a makefile at the start of line to pas makefile comment thru the c preprocessor and into the makefile most of the c preprocessors that i have use will not treat such a a appear at the start of the line thus the c preprocessor do not treat the hash symbol a the start of a directive however the ibm cpp strip the comment and treat the hash symbol a the start of a directive the cpp fails when it determines that    this    be not a know directive i have temporarily hack my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a well fix 2 several imakefiles use      a a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro do not need a value for the parameter the aix cpp give warning about these situation but continue to work ok  if you be familiar with these problem and have solution i would appreciate information about on your solution perhaps this be solve in a later version of imake that i have not review also do you know of other cpp s that behave similarly

 what it have to do with your original question be this many time begin x user heck experienced x user too write small test program many time they forget to draw only in response to expose event and thus see unpreditable result whereby sometimes the application s graphic show up and sometimes they just try to eliminate all the    easy    explanation for why not see your graphic that be say why you try copying different plane to your window other than 16    1 4 try 1 1 1 1 2     1 7 to see it you get any output since dipslaying only a single plane of your data possible that all the pixel value in your pixmap have the same value for that color plane ken

 what have this get to do with comp windows x i agree that this be a side track but it be funny that i skip so many other article thread but i resist reading this one my belief opinion and expression be strictly my own and do not represent or reflect any official or unofficial policy or attitude of any other person or organization     but i have heard that ford motor company have have a recruiting bias toward engineer and away from computer science graduate the reason be supposedly to well meet long range personnel requirement this be evidence by the large number of c people who be employ via contract and be not brought on board except in special circumstance this be a generalization which obviously always hold true but there be statistic furthermore most    software engineering    at ford get do by electrical engineer i know of 2 univerities that have merge the computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than program

 be use the xmgraph widget be float around and i notice the performance be significantly well use gadget perhaps even 100 faster i have heard in an old program course that gadget be no longer any benefit to performance and that just a well to use widget everywhere so why would  50 pushbutton gadget be a lot quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph should i start put gadget back into my long pulldown menu xmgraph manages child connect by xmarc widget in a direct network type graph with automatic layout capability bill

 i would suggest skip olwm and get olvwm instead this version of the olwm window manager implement a virtual desktop that i find really handy even on large monitor this version be also available at export lcs mit edu  contrib olvwm3 tar z the readme file also suggest get the file in  contrib xview3 in my case i built the x server first xview second then olvwm all of these be instal into  usr x5 once i verify the server work correctly i happily issue    rm  rf  usr openwin      use gcc 2 3 3 to build all of the above result in a windowing system that be for all intent and purpose identical to openwindows 3 0 and that be incredibly faster there be a bit of tweak you will have to do if you want thing to work _exactly_ like openwindows but not much

 correct most x server use a version of malloc 3 which will not return memory to the o ie the x server might free 3 a pixmap but the heap do not shrink well part of the routine i mention do a dirty little trick to get around that problem first i create the share memory segment attach the client attach the x server and then remove the segment if you read the man page on remove of share memory segment you will see that the segment only dy after all attachment be go now if the client dy one attachment go the o clean up for you and since the x server notice the client have dy free up resource include detach from the segment there go the last attachment no more share memory segment terrible but it work regard
 jan nntp posting host 134 244 49 156 jan on a related note how can i use xv to display color gifs on my jan root display with hp vue jan all i can do with vue be display xbm  s through their jan backdrop style manager jan xv do not seem to be able to override whatever vue jan put there i suspect this be because vue creates a window probably overrideredirect that be the size of or large than the root window because the window manager do not know about this you can not move resize etc it xv in the mean time be busy change your root window to whatever you have request but you never get to see it because vue  s window be overlaid on top of the root window contact hp support and see whether vue can support colour bitmap format such a xpm if they cant then they probably create all their colour backdrop inside the code

 hi i use emacs and i want to customize my keyboard well when i set up stuff in my  emacs with a keymap and define keys i can only access certain of the key on my x terminal s keyboard i get e g f10 home end pgup pgdn they all seem to have either the same or no keycode i have a feel this be fix in emacs itself but that i need to do some xmodmap stuff can someone help me unfortunately the key event handle be pretty much hardwired into emacs i ran into this problem a while back my solution be to change the source code so that all of these special key generate character sequence which basically encode the keysym and modifier state a escape sequence    for example the sequence    esc 1 b 7    would indicate that the    home    key be press with the shift key down you could also detect standard key with odd modifier such a    shift return    if anybody want these change welcome to them but have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit basically you have to replace the keypress handle code in the source file    x11term c    maybe if someone at osf be interested i can send them the tweak but i imagine they  ve get big fish to fry hopefully include the much talk about emacs v19 if there  s sufficient interest i  ll post the mod somewhere although this probably the appropriate group for it note this special code will only apply if you let emacs create it own x11 window if you run it in plain old tty mode which include xterm window then business a usual the patch i make be to version 18 58 under sun o 4 1 2 i also do this a while back under hp ux the patch be in a chunk of code between if sun     endif but could easily be adapt for anything else

 try the  m sc compute science course at the real newcastle university a conversion course but at least they teach real program in the space of 9 month we be taught pascal simula prolog miranda also some basic low level stuff 68000 be cover a well they also do concurrent program and operating system some software engineering plus quite a few optional unit include database theory and some stuff about comms the pascal be to be replace by c c   i think next year i lear n t this and x window program a well anyway via a good selection of project over the final three month depend on your taste the selection of skill lear n t can be quite wide reach the one critiscism i would level at the course which i would have thought invaluable be the lack of an option to do the project period in industry this would probably need a slightly longer project period say six month but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course yes i know this sound like a plug for the course why not

 the reason they place their outside corner at the location you request be because what the icccm say they should do this code will almost certainly break call xmapwindow and then xflush do not guarantee that the window be visible and manage by the window manager even if this do work there a reliable way to find out how much decoration the window manager place around your window so you know how far to move it and what if the window manager refuse to move your window

 i be planning to use the follow pipe to move some display data to a system that have a color hardcopy unit xwd xwud  display hostname 0 0 i have test it with some simple window like the openwindows file manager and it work fine but when i try it with a more complex large image the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault i try it without the pipe by redirect xwd  s output to a file and then use the file a input to xwud and get the same error from xwud if i have to guess it seem like run out of memory but this happen on a sparc 10 with 64 meg 128 meg swap space and only one user with minimal activity the file be about 3 mb this verion of xwd xwud be supply with the sun openwindows 3 0 distribution which i believe corresponds to x11 r4 any idea thanks in advance                                                                                                                   dave hume john hopkins university apply physic laboratory 410 792 6651 humesdg1 aplcomm jhuapl edu
 there be no easy answer to this question it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off screen memory and if so how efficiently the server manages these resource have to deal with limited off screen memory be the bane of the server implementor  s existence i have work with graphic device where the off screen memory to main display copy rate eclipse that of the main memory to display copy rate and with those where the main memory to display be  faster  than off screen to display require only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the f b follow by a write if your server us the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in cpu main memory the rate you can get through mit shm be likely to be equal maybe a tad slow depend on your o  s implementation of share memory to copyarea from pixmap to window which be also then just a copy from cpu main memory to graphic device one advanage of mit shm be that if your image be large you end up grow the size of the server process to hold them one disadvantage of the mit shm be that in it sample implementation there be no provision for elegantly cleaning up the share memory segment if the client dy a sudden violent death e g     kill    you have to be mindful of clutter up the system with zombie share memory segment ken

 here  s what i think have figure out all i need to do be install the r5 disitribution without the xserver like the sony cf file defines and all the new library utils etc  will be instal and my old server from r4 will still work this will allow me to run xview 3 0 and have x11r5 up and run do the server interface remain the same with all change make only to the libs another question be it likely that since sun be drop ow support that the desktop utils like the file manager will be make public it would be nice if company would make old code public for the benefit of those of u with small budget    mike hopper acs virginia edu

 hello when start bx if you recieve an error message say    can not load app defaults file        check your xapplresdir environment variable and then put the file builderxcessory this be the app defaults file for bx in the directory specify by the xuserfilesearchpath environment variable if you have an xuserfilesearchpath environment variable then set xuserfilesearchpath to be the directory where the builderxcessory file be you can do this use the setenv command under csh note that the name end in  ad so you will have to set xuserfilesearchpath to bx n ad to get the app defaults to load correctly to make sure the the app defaults file can be read by all the user make sure that a copy of or a link to the app defaults file exists in  usr lib x11 app defaults or  usr openwin lib app defaults depend on how your system be set up once you have take care of this set the  systemdirectory resource to be the directory in which you have instal bx for example let  s say instal bx in  t then my system directory resource should be set like this  systemdirectory  t builderxcessory

 i need to have pc and sparcstations run the same application namely microsoft project the original system ran on the pc now it need to be expand to allow unix user to work with the application the current proposal be to use desqview x a a display server for the application i would like to know your experience with use desqview x to run an application on a pc and display on a sparcstation heard that the network traffic be slow reply only by e mail please thanks in advance
 i have a problem where an athena strip chart widget be not call get value function i be pretty sure this be happen because i be not use xtappmainloop but be deal with event via socket ya ya anyway i want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget s will call their get value callback or if someone know another fast way around this or any way for that matter let me know i can not or i think call the xtngetvalue callback myself because i have the value for the third parameter of the get value proc xtpointer call_data in other word i want to force a strip chart widget to update itself any idea anyone
 i want to be able to send a pixmap from one client to the next along with this i want to send the colormap and foreground and background pixel value so far not a problem i can do this with no problem however once i have the pixmap id and the colormap id how do i go about tell the server that the second receive client now want to have association with the two id  s tia john
 we recently get an ncd x terminal to evaluate this be run xremote over a serial line i want to get some measurement of response time so i write a small xlib program which simply creates a window map it and sends the first expose event to itself the program time the delay from send the event to receive it i thought this be the simplest way to test client x server round trip delay a similar concept to the ping 8c program be this a valid test to perform also try the xbench program available from ftp uu net which bombard the server with graphic operation but i just want to get a quantative measure of what be    acceptable    interactive response time have anyone get any idea on this subject thanks andrew afielden mlsma att com
 the protocol have to move the whole image from process memory to server memory this be the hog the conversion in the xputimage be fast yes by utilize the mit shm extension that provide an xputimage derivate that us share memory fine fast no you can still xputimage all of the frame onto pixmaps thus move them to server memory and then replay them fast use xcopyarea but be aware this be a major server memory bummer
 i be have problem with a motif application that when run on another machine with different x path etc find the xkeysymdb file this cause a large warn output warn translation table syntax error unknown keysym name osfactivate warn     found while parse key osfactivate managerparentactivate warn translation table syntax error unknown keysym name osfcancel warn     found while parse key osfcancel managerparentcancel warn translation table syntax error unknown keysym name osfselect warn     found while parse key osfselect managergadgetselect             etc a the file be in a different location but xt seem to only look for it in the place where it be on the machine the app be compile on be there any way to read the xkeysymdb manually with an x xt call so that addition to the xkeysymdb can be distribute with the application i have use trace 1 to find out what be go on but i need a fix so that these translation in the application can be recognise
 there  s documentation on how to use the share memory extension in the x11r5 distribution actually i just finish write a motif animation program     take lots of image data and display it pretty darn fast when use on server pixmaps or share memory i have to insert a delay loop to keep it from go too quickly test both method side by side they be just about equal the advantage of shm be that your x server grow to ridiculous size but pixmaps can work over a network and  are  remove if your application dy one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debug shm apps share memory also have the problem that some operating system e g ultrix seem to allow only a small number of segment  6 to be attach to a process at once consequently a redraw becomes xshmattach xshmputimage xshmdetach on dec system and dec  s 24 bit display like the one i tend to use most often seem to support the extension maybe someone compile them wrong and use pixmaps cause the x server to crash fail mallocs so one  has  to use the local unix domain socket which really that bad one copy the info three time per redraw instead of one in short allow all three form of display within the program be a good thing minus shm if run over a network and let the user pick whatever feel fast i just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it
 i have a togglebutton widget yes widget and i have a routine which change the color of the foreground and background of the label well the background change alright but the label text do not redraw itself i be guess that i have to force it to redraw with an xexposeevent sent to it via xsendevent be this the best way to get the text up again i seeem to get xsendevent to work right     if this be a good approach might anyone have an example lie around to show me how to do this rtfm all even and do not find a decent example p i keep get segmentation fault in xsendevent tho all the value be a expect thanks in advance
 do anyone know what be available in term of automate test of x motif application i be think of a system which i could program or which could record events output with our verification test procedure and then run rerun each time we do regression test i be interested in a product like this for our unix project and for a separate project which will be use openvms a question like this be answer in the faq about share x window one of the answer be xtrap a record and playback extenstion to x  you can find it at export lcs mit edu  contrib xtrapv33_x11r5 tar z do anyone know of a program which require an x extension most the the x server we have at work have vendor extension which we modify so xtrap help up there be x conferencing software at mit but i know how easy it would be to modify it to do record and playback any help would be appreciate
 newly the pixel be you could set up a bitmap with a mask in it clear the bitmap draw the rectangle to be delete with gxor draw the one that be to stay with gxclear then gxxor the entire pixmap with the screen note that this be a pretty effective way of animation if you ever need to do that replace the gxclear with a gxxor                joe hildebrand hildjj fuentez com software engineer fuentez system concept 703 273 1447
 i be have the same problem compile x11r5 on a ipc sunos 4 1 3  if you compile with  make  k world it will not stop on the ld error a be state in another post the client with the error still run correctly
 what sort of traffic be generate with the x calls i be curious to find out the require bandwidth that a link must have if one machine run dv x be support multiple user client and we require adequate response time anyone have any idea
 the only time see similar behaviour be when an x application fork a child without set close on exec on the x display connection file descriptor the shell wait for a configurenotify event that never arrive because it get picked up by the child sometimes the shell correctly get the configurenotify if the timing be  right
 a simple question to all the xperts be it possible to use several x terminals with only one mouse and one keyboard any suggestion thanks rainer
 consider write my own widget but i like to have some sample widget source code to look over first where could i find something like this be there any archive accessible by anonymous ftp that contain such information
 dear xperts here  s my problem i be design several related x application each one be a separate executable and like to build a single control window that would allow the user to access each application instead of have to locate the correct icon the control window would contain a button for each application and by press it the application  s main window would appear i would also like to use the application  s button a a color status indicator have anyone do this or have any good idea because these be all separate executables this seem like a communication nightmare to me but maybe wrong appreciate any idea use x11r5 and motif 1 2 1 thanks dbohdal jaguar ess harris com i can think of two different method that you could try 1 use fork and execv 2 use the    system    call in your program assume that run under the unix o of course
 content problem with table widget in r5 the follow part of a program an user interface for a simulation system do work in r4 but refuse to in r5 of cause the r4 version do not know about the xptablewidgetclass we use tablewidgetclass instead caught from the net in time of r3 and xptablechildposition formerly xttblposition since compile with r5 the program cause a zero width or height

 another company congruent corporation of new york city have also port xlib xt and motif 1 1 over to m window nt which provide full client development for x application in an nt environment if you be port interview over to m window i thought interview be a c   toolkit with c   class if that be so how can it be built on xlib unless the class be call xlib function steve
 like to compile x11r5 on a sony nws 1750 run news 4 1c the x distribution have support for this config and the release note say it have be test on the machine but also in the release note nothing from sony be list under the support server what be i suppose to use for my r5 x server then how can the o be support but not the hardware be there something in the r4 binary that can be use a the r5 server these may seem like silly question but  really  confuse    mike hopper acs virginia edu
 the follow package meet your criterion in that they be pd and present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the user if you can use 386bsd there be xview3 openlook there be interview which look a little like motif there be gopath a very nice c   toolkit for athena widget and motif which be simpler and well than interview and you will enjoy technical support from bull via e mail it have a nice draw program it us motif which can be use to create graphical front end to program the data format be call stream which you can feed to your program i port gopath on an internet machine which be go but if you use gcc 2 3 3 with minimal effort gopath can be port to 386bsd last but not least gopath interface to toolkits via a driver module they have an ms windows driver module for instance also many have write extension to tk tcl thus allow powerful application for instance tcl_nm have snmp extension for tk tcl with ease i can now combine snmp network operation with graph photo widget graphical interface file operation database operation etc   the author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network management application which be about 80 line long it displayed various environmental parameter from a router i write a simple strip chart script for display real time ip receive packets seconds hope this help amancio hasty

 what i want to be able to do be to set the cursor color to the same a the forground color that be set for that xterm from the man page         cr color this option specifies the color to use for text cur  sor the default be to use the same foreground    color that be use for text    however this doesnt seem to be the case it appear to default to black or to whatever xterm cursorcolor be set to
 standard colormaps be spec  d with the intention that window manager would make them available this mean that every window manager author in the world immediately drop everything they be do and implement this at top priority the esge server we ship make the xa_rgb_best_map available at startup it wait for window manager to do it do your hardware have only one clut since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entry there be no way it can avoid displace the entire default colormap if your hardware have only one clut i believe standard colormaps be intend to aboid possible colormap flash between client use the default coilormap rather colormap flash will be avoid between two client that use the same standard colormap an example would be two client that need a full color range would both use xa_rgb_best_map or whatever call under x11r5 if you be try to avoid colormap flash with the default colormap your best bet be to try to load all the color you use into that colormap if you do that then get flash on a one hw clut framebuffer now if your window manager use the same standard colormap a your client this flash could also be avoid perhaps some window manager have command line option for select standard colormaps
 i think you will find that the active linux and 386bsd community be populate by enthusiast who would object to pay  any  money for software otherwise they would probably have go for a commercial unix an important factor in the linux community be that source code be always available this be probably similar in the 386bsd community however not really involve there many people use linux like to stay at the cut bleeding edge ie when kernel patch c library or compiler patch come out people like to rebuild their entire system the prime requirement for all linux software be that it be available under a gnu style public license hence linux software us either the athena widget or xview individual may write software require motif but i doubt it be widely adopt regard
 we developed a toolkit run on the x window system the toolkit cope with any language base on x11r5  s i18n facility a you know there be 2 kind of i18n implementation from mit  s x11r5 release    xsi and ximp our original implementation of the toolkit us xsi our toolkit manages each character  s size base on our own font management system in order to do that the  wchar_t typed character string must be decompose to character set this mean that if one wchar_t type compound string with ascii and kanji mixed for example be give each element of the wchar_t array must be checked it correspond character set base on a bit layout and application environment  s locale in this case if the locale be  japanese each wchar_t character will be classify either to iso8859 1 jisx0208 or so we need a function to do this the function must check how many character from the top be the same character set and what the character set be we could not find any public x11r5 function to do that and inevitably use xsi  s internal function to construct that function the follow be the source code of that function  decomposecharacterset   i18n h    this may look like c code but it be really     c          id i18n h v 1 1 1992 01 21 12 05 24 iima exp iima ifndef _i18n_h define _i18n_h include x11 xlib h extern int decomposecharacterset const wchar_t  wc_str    in    int wc_len    in    char  buf    out    int  buflen    in out    int  scanned_len    out    char   charset    out    extern xmstring wchartoxmstring const wchar_t  wc_str extern xmstringcharset charsetofwchar const wchar_t wc endif    _i18n_h      i18n cc    id i18n cc v 1 1 1992 01 21 12 05 05 iima exp    include stdlib h include x11 xlibint h include xm xm h include    i18n h    extern    c    include x11 wchar h define _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xxx_xwcdecomposeglyphcharset define _xmbfscs xxx_xmbfscs define _xmbctidtocsid xxx_xmbctidtocsid include    xlocaleint h    undef _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset undef _xmbfscs undef _xmbctidtocsid extern int _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xlocale const wchar_t  int char  int  int  int  extern charset  _xmbfscs xlocale _csid extern _csid _xmbctidtocsid xlocale _csid int decomposecharacterset const wchar_t  wc_str    in    int wc_len    in    char  buf    out    int  buf_len    in out    int  scanned_len    out    char   charset    out    xlocale xlocale _xfallbackconvert int ctid int status charset  xcharset status _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xlocale wc_str wc_len buf buf_len scanned_len ctid if status    success xcharset _xmbfscs xlocale _xmbctidtocsid xlocale ctid  charset xcharset xcharset  cs_name null else  charset null return status                         an include file above    xlocaleint h    be also xsi internal and we copy the file to the toolkit directory and compile a serious issue occur when we try to compile a toolkit application on our hp machine with it o version of hp ux9 01 when we try to link an application base on our toolkit link error occur say that the follow function be miss _xmbctidtocsid code _xmbfscs code _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset code _xfallbackconvert code we have use mit release version of x11r5 and it xsi implementation until hp up9 0 and ran application successfully one of the reason to use xsi be that because hp do not release hp  s x11r5 until the o 9 0 and we have no way to know how hp  s r5 would be implement we have hop xsi  s popularity and use it internal function the hp  s linker complains that there be no xsi internal function implement we observe from hp  s libx11 a they use some ximp implementation but we be not sure if they use mit  s vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and therefore find just counter part function in mit  s ximp for xsi do not seem to lead u a solution my question and goal be to know how we can construct a function like  decomposecharacterset list above be there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type string depend on locale if it be a public function that be perfect but even if it be not we want to use any internal function in hp  s x11r5 a we do for mit  s r5 in order to render a  wchar_t type string there must be some machinery to judge character set and that be how the proper font be select for the string we have no way to find out that without any hp  s x11r5 source file we want to know how we can use that for our goal any help or comment would be highly appreciate i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treat around this area even if it be not hp  s implementation thank you

 archive name x faq speedups last modified 1993 4 15 how to maximize the performance of x    monthly post compile by art mulder art cs ualberta ca more ram faster cpu  s more disk space faster ethernet     these be the standard response you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation well more hardware always an option and i wonder if more hardware be always even a necessity this    faq    list be a collection of suggestion and idea from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from x window on your workstation without purchasing more hardware performance be a highly subjective issue the individual user must balance speed versus feature in order to come to a personal decision therefore this document can be be expect to contain many subjective opinion in and amongst the objective fact this document be specifically concerned with x  there be of course many other factor that can affect the performance of a workstation however they be outside the scope of this document people seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the o reilly nutshell handbook    system performance tune    by mike loukides about 25 of the way through reading it and it look like a well written comprehensive treatment of system performance unaware of any other similar book    ed                         table

                    there be a lot of window manager out there with lot of different feature and ability the choice of which to use be by necessity a balance act between performance and useful feature at this point most respondent have agree upon    twm    a the best candidate for a speedy window manager a couple of generic trick you can try to soup up your window manger be turn off unnecessary thing like    zoom    and    opaque move    also if you lay out your window in a tile manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raise and lower overlap window joe english joe trystero art com found that a good font for tile be 7x13 aka  misc fixed medium r normal    13 100 100 100 c 70 iso8859 1 it be the big font i know of that i can use on my sun 1152x900 screen and still get two 80 column terminal window side by side on the display with no overlap other font suggestion will be accepted                   the x server                   which server make sure that your server be a proper match for your hardware if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x11 server on my monochrome sun i notice much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it be point out to me that xsunmono be about 800k small and therefore should contribute to less page thanks to jonny farringdon j farringdon psychol ucl ac uk michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson se how your server be compile can also make a difference jeff law law schirf cs utah edu advises u that on a sun system x should be compile with gcc version 2 or with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect to get     very  large speedup in the server    by not use the bundle sunos compiler i assume that similar result would occur if you use one of the other high quality commercial compiler on the market lock the server into ram have anyone try hack the x server so that it be lock into ram and do not get page eg via a call to plock do this help performance at all have one inquiry on this topic and a few pointer to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone who  s try it i be not in a position to give it a try thanks to eric c claeys ecc eperm att com danny backx db sunbim be juan d  martin juando cnm us es start your server joe english joe trystero art com if you start up a lot of client in your  xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launch each one after i change my  xclients script to do this log in actually take  less  time     we have a heavily load system without much core though this sound crazy but i have confirm that it work warner losh imp solbourne com provide me with a good explanation of why this work which i have summarize here when you start up an x server it take a huge amount of time to start accept connection a lot of initialization be do by the server when it start this process touch a large number of page any other process run at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself sort out before the client start up similarly there be also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program start toolkits register widget resource be fetch program initialize state and    database    and so forth all this activity be typically memory intensive once this initialization be do    the process have reach a steady state    the memory usage typically settle down to use only a few page by use sleep to stagger the launch of your client in your  xinitrc you avoid them fight each other for your workstation  s limited resource this be most definitely a    your mileage may vary    situation a there be so many variable to be consider available ram local swap space load average number of user on your system which client you be start etc currently in my  xinitrc i have a situation like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm experiment with sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 2 exec xbiff sleep 3 exec xterm sleep 4 exec xterm even try sleep 2 exec start_x_clients_script and then in start_x_clients_script i have sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm the idea with this last one be to make sure that xinit have completely finish processing my  xinitrc and have settle down into a    steady state    before the sleep expire and all my client be launch all of these yield fairly comparable result and so i just stuck with my current setup for it simplicity you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suit you font load font take time and ram if you minimize the number of font your application use get speed increase in load up time one simple strategy be to choose a small number of font one small one large one roman whatever suit you and configure all your client    or at least all your heavily use client    to use only those few font client program should start up quicker if their font be already load into the server this will also conserve server resource since few font will be load by the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp ptcbu oz au joe english joe trystero art com eg my main xterm font be 7x13 so i also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all menu and icon etc twm  s default font be 8x13 since i normally use 8x13 eliminate one font from my server oliver jones oj roadrunner pictel com keep font local to the workstation rather than load them over nfs if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable font use a font server about the resource file keep your  xresources  xdefaults file small save ram and save on server startup time joe english joe trystero art com one suggestion in your  xdefaults  xresources file try put only the minimum number of resource that you want to have available to all of your application for example  reversevideo true then separate your resource into individual client specific resource file for example home lib app defaults in your  login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults  n the    comp windows x frequently ask question    faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variable work    ed so when xterm launch it load it resource from      app defaults xterm xdvi find them in      app defaults xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all client follow the same xxxxx resource file name pattern you can check in your system app defaults directory often  usr x11r5 lib x11 app defaults  to find the proper name and then name your personal resource file with the same name this be all document in the xt specification pg 125 666 thanks to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc com michael urban urban cobra jpl nasa gov and mike long mikel ee cornell edu kevin be willing mail his setup file to inquirer this method of organize your personal resource have the follow benefit easy to maintain more usable few resource be store in the x server in the resource_manager property a a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resource application only process their own resource never have to sort through all of your resource to find the one that affect them it also have drawback the application that you be interested in have to load an additional file every time it start up this seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability if you be modify an application  s resource database you just need to re run the application without have to    xrdb    again xrdb will by default run your  xdefaults file through cpp when your resource be split out into multiple resource file and then load by the individual client program they will not watch out for this i have c style comment in my  xdefaults file which cpp strip out when i switch to this method of distribute resource file i spent several frustrate day try to figure out why my client be not find their resource xt do  not  provide any error message when it encounter the c style comment in the resource file it simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e g    ifdef color        be enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management you may also run into some client which break the rule for example neither emacs 18 58 3 nor xvt 1 0 will find their resource if they be anywhere other than in  xdefaults when start up a client on a machine that do not share file with the machine where your resource be store your client will not find it resource load all your resource into the server will guarantee that all of your client will always find their resource casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov a possible compromise suggestion that i have and be planning on try be to put resource for all my heavily use client eg xterm into my  xdefaults file and to use the    separate resource file    method for client that i seldom use define your display properly client program be often execute on the same machine a the server in that situation rather than set your display environment variable to    hostname  0 0    where hostname be the name of your workstation you should set your display variable to    unix 0 0    or     0 0    by do this you access optimize routine that know that the server be on the same machine and use a share memory method of transfer request thanks to patrick j horgan pjh70 ras amdahl com see the _display names_ section of the x 1 man page for far explanation of how to properly set your display name    i think stock mit but at least data general and hp have library that be smart enough to use local communication even when the display set specially    rob sartin 88opensi sartin uunet uu net jody goldberg jody algorithmics com sent me an xlib patch to change stock r5 to use local communication even if display be not properly set i want to get in the business of distribute or

  client          if you only have a few megabyte of ram then you should think carefully about the number of program you be run think also about the _kind_ of program you be run for example be there a small clock program than xclock unfortunately i really notice that program advertise how large they be so the onus be on u to do the research and spread the word suggestion on well alternative to the some of the standard client eg xclock xterm xbiff be welcome    ed receive some contradictory advice from people on the subject of x client program some advocate the use of program that be strictly xlib base since xt xaw and other toolkits be rather large others warn u that other application which you be use may have already load up one or more of these share library in this case use a non xt for example client program may actually _increase_ the amount of ram consume the upshot of all this seem to be mix toolkits that be try and use just athena client or just xview client or just motif client etc if you use more than one then drag in more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client program would work best together in that environment thanks

in current version you can not bind key a you can in xterm heard that there be version of xvt with this feature but not found any yet update march 1993 i recently have a few email conversation with brian warkentin brian warkentine eng sun com regard xvt he question whether xvt really be at all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scroll speed try this quickie benchmark  bin time dd if  etc termcap bs 40 and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may be slightly large in ram requirement we have any hard number here do anyone else share library and share text segment mean that xterm  s page requirement be not that major a an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it make little difference since if you never use it it never get brought into memory so here we stand with some conflict report on the validity of xvt over xterm in summary caveat emptor your mileage may vary if you can provide some hard data like to see it specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each need relative speed of each 2 mterm suggest by der mouse mouse lightning mcrcim mcgill edu available larry mcrcim mcgill edu 132 206 1

program to work faster from scott barman scott asd com come a suggestion regard motif text field widget i notice that during data entry into motif text field widget i be get a slight lag in response to some keystroke particularly the initial one in the field examine the what be go on with xscope i found it it seem that when the resource xmnblinkrate be non zero and the focus be on a text field widget or even just a text widget the i beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appear or disappears in those widget the widget code be make a request to the server copyarea the user can stop this by set the resource xmnblinkrate to 0  it be not noticeable on a 40mhz sparc but it do make a little difference on a slow system this specific suggestion can probably be apply in general to lot of area consider your heavily use client be there any minor embellishment that can be turn off and thereby save on server request                                     miscellaneous suggestion                                     pretty picture use large bitmap gif  s etc a root window background the more complicate your root window bitmap the slow the server be at redrawing your screen when you reposition window or redraw etc these take up ram and cpu power i work on a sun sparc and conscious of performance issue i comprehend it when i see people with a 4mb sun 3 60 run xphoon a their root window i  ll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupy by have a full screen root image on a colour workstation if anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for client and so rarely see the root window anyway thanks to qiang alex zhao azhao cs arizona edu for remind me of this one    ed a quicker mouse use xset you can adjust how fast your pointer move on

individual button label list et al use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest level manager widget again stick to a few font a possible well yet use motif at all an absolute pig create and destroy widget on the fly try to reuse them this will avoid many problem with buggy toolkits too use a line width of 0 in gc on some server this make a huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose event this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi uia ac be just a small remark i once heard that use a well malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt base application since they use malloc heavily they suggest try out the gnuy malloc but i find the time yet i do some test on small program just do malloc and free and the difference be indeed very noticeable somewhat 5 time faster any confirmation on this from anyone    ed andre beck andre_beck irs inf tu dresden de unnecessary noexpose event most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane a fast blit routine but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the gc use for the blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most case only put load onto the connection and force the client to run through event loop again and again thousand of xchangegc request this    gfx context switch    be also see in most handcoded x apps where only one or few gc be create and then heavily change again and again xt us a definitely well mechanism by cache and share a lot of gc with all need parameter this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc request from the connection by move it toward the client startup phase say what some contributor propose idea that seem right off the wall at first david b  lewis by day dbl osf

uucp firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu  s be mostly idle x s cpu usage be bursty so the chance of you and your teammate do something cpu intensive at the same time be small if they be not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your action the second factor be that context switch be expensive use 2 cpu  s half them you pay a price due to the overhead of go over the network but this be offset in most case by the improve buffering of a network typically 20k v 4k for a pipe allow even few context switch                                           other source of information
