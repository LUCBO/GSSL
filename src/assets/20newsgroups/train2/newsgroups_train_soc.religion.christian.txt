b"i write in response to dlecoint garnet.acns.fsu.edu darius_lecointe be paul a god too be an interpretation of the word of paul of high priority than the direct word of jesus in matt5:14-19 paul begin roman 14 with `` if someone be weak in the faith ... '' do you count yourself a one who be weak in the faith yes but what do the bible have to say what do jesus say paul close roman 14 with `` on the other hand the person with doubt about something who eats it anyway be guilty because he act on his faith and any failure to act on faith be a sin '' gaus isbn:0-933999-99-2 have you read the ten commandment which be a portion of the law have you read jesus word in matt5:14-19 be there any doubt in your mind about what be right and what be sin greek hamartia miss the mark whereas the ten commandment and jesus word in matt5:14-19 be fairly clear be they not matt5:14-19 answer your question break bread roughly synonymous with eat how do you unite this concept of yours with the ten commandment and jesus 's word in matt5:14-19 or they assume that the ten commandment and jesus word in matt5:14-19 actually stood for something perhaps they be `` strong in the faith '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- no i believe that paul can overrule god however paul be write for a largely gentile audience the law be regard by jew at the time and now a binding on jew but not on gentile there be rule that be binding on all human being the so-called noachic law but they be quite minimal the issue that the church have to face after jesus death be what to do about gentile who want to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them say that the law be abolish it simply acknowledge that fact that it apply to gentile thus there be no contradiction with mat 5. a far a i can tell both paul and other jewish christian do continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thus they continued to obey the law the issue be and be with gentile christian who be not cover by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspect of it jesus dealt mostly with jew i think we can reasonably assume that mat 5 be direct to a jewish audience he do interact with gentile a few time e.g the centurion whose slave be heal and a couple of others the term use to describe the centurion see luke 7 suggest that he be a `` god-fearer '' i.e a gentile who follow god but have not adopt the whole jewish law he be commend by jewish elder a a worthy person and jesus accepted him a such this seem to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevail view that gentile need not accept the law however there 's more involve if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul 's apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least a i read paul he say that the law serf a purpose that have be in a certain sense supercede again this issue one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul note that he might be understood this way and assures u that not what he intend to say rather he see the law a primarily be present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately an impossible standard and one that have be supercede by christ paul 's comment be not the world 's clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the interest thing to notice be that even this radical position do not entail an abolition of the law it still remains a an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be remove for it purpose of convict of sin important that it not be relaxed however for christian not the end -- ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical category they use be rather different in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quote passage from mat 5 should be take in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus show u how he interprets the law the `` not an iota or dot '' would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact not jesus approach jesus interpretation emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial detail indeed he be well know for take a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that mat 5:17-20 need to be take in the context of 1st cent jewish discussion jesus accuses his opponent of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herb but neglect the thing that really matter justice mercy and faith and care about how cup and plate be clean but not about the fact that inside the people who use them be full of extortion and rapacity mat 23:23-25 this and the discussion later in mat 5 suggest that jesus have a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talk about maintain the law in it full strength he be think of these aspect of it paul 's conclusion be similar while he talk about the law be supercede all of the specific example he give involve the '' ceremonial law '' such a circumcision and the sabbath he be quite concerned about maintain moral standard the net result of this be that when paul talk about the law be supercede and jesus talk about the law be maintain i believe they be talk about different aspect of the law paul be embroil in argument about circumcision a be natural in letter respond to specific situation look at the aspect of the law that be currently cause trouble the law a specifically jewish ceremony he certainly do not intend to abolish divine standard of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seem to be talk the law in it broad implication for moral and human relationship and deemphasizing those aspect that be later to give paul so much trouble unfortunate that people use the same term in different way but we should be familiar with that from current conflict look at the way term like `` family value '' take on special meaning from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future try to figure out why `` family value '' should be use a a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s. i think law have take on a similar role in the argument paul be involve in paul be clearly not reject all of the jewish value that go along with the term `` law '' any more than people who concerned about the `` family value '' movement be really oppose to family value"

b"with frank 's permission i have add some information here and in one case change the order of his contribution in order to clarify the historical relationship of the view my comment be base primarily on william rusch 's historical summary in `` the trinitarian controversy '' fortress go to save this a an faq -- clh major view of the trinity second century the writer of the 2nd cent be important because they set up much of the context for the later discussion justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch be know a the '' apologist '' their theology have often be described a `` logo theology '' base strongly on word in john they take more or less a two-phase approach through eternity the logo be with the father a his mind or thought this `` immanent word '' become '' express '' a god reveal himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only become visible in history though the logo have be present in god from eternity rusch regard this view be contain many of the emphasis of the final orthodox position but in a form which be less sophisticated because it do not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held view somewhat similar to the apologist however he be uncomfortable with the two-stage approach he still view god a one personage with distinction that do not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation the `` economy '' the distinction be present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasize the holy spirit more than the apologist irenaeus view should probably be call `` economic trinitarianism '' though that term be normally use a below to refer to later development third century -- clh dynamic monarchianism source theodotus

subsistence the notion of a subsistent god be a palpable impossibility since his perfect unity be perfectly indivisible the 'diversity of god be apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god not to a hypostatic union asignation of deity/eternality father unique originator of the universe he be eternal self-existent and without begin or end son a virtuous but finite man in whose life god be dynamically present in a unique way christ definitely be not deity though his humanity be deify holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality be ascribed to the holy spirit criticism s elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concern the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermine the theological undergird for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary this probably best thought of a not be trinitarianism at all god be an undifferentiated one son and holy spirit be see a simply name for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church -- clh modalistic monarchianism source praxeas adherent noatus sabellius

idea that be clearly heretical it concept of successive manifestation of the godhead can not account for such simultaneous appearance of the three person a at christ 's baptism rusch comment that evidence on these belief be sketchy there be actually two slightly different group include noetus and his follower and sabellius noetus be apparently more extreme sabellius follow him and attempt to use some feature of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius come from a century later and there seem to be some confusion between him and

to be a logical implication criticism s be more tentative and ambiguous in it treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that this be a development of the apologist and irenaeus a mention

the son a a mediator mediate between the absolute one of god and the plurality of create being the son be generate but he be `` eternally generate '' that be the relationship between father and son be eternal it can not be say that `` there be once when he be not '' a phrase that will haunt the discussion for century have the son be intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son be described a separate `` hypostasis '' though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it have in some context the union be one of love and action but there be some reason to think that he may have use the term homoousios `` of the same substance '' the holy spirit be also an active personal substance originate by the father through the son origen 's intent be trinitarian not

of a carry origen 's thought a bit too far to the point of make the son a separate entity in general the east tend to take an approach base on origen 's and it be hard to get acceptance of nicea in

b"an interest interpretation of revelation 17 and 18 have be give by evangelist david wilkerson i be not say that i totally agree with his interpretation but it be certainly believable and good food for thought he interprets the babylon of revelation 17-18 a be none other than the good old u. s. of a. right america he support his claim in several way the babylon of revelation be the world leader in trade and commerce and the whole world wept when babylon fell the american dollar despite the japanese success of the 20th century be still the most sought after currency in the world if the u.s. be destroyed the whole world mourn the bible also talk about babylon be a home of harlot sin and adultery i be paraphrase of course babylon 's sin affected or should i say infect the whole world it take much look to see that the u.s. be in a state of moral decay the american culture and hollywood spread the `` do it if it feel good '' mentality all over the world i think though that what mr. wilkerson us a his strong argument be the fact that revelation call babylon `` babylon the great '' and portrays it a the most powerful nation on earth no matter how dissatisfied you be with the state of our country i think you would have too much trouble agree that the u.s. be still the most powerful nation on earth again this interpretation be not necessarily my own but i do find it worthy of consideration"

b"vera shanti noyes writes of course i believe in predestination a very biblical doctrine a roman 8.28-30 show among other passage furthermore the church have always taught predestination from the very begin but to say that i believe in predestination do not mean i do not believe in free will men freely choose the course of their life which be also affected by the grace of god however unlike the calvinist and jansenist i hold that grace be resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of deny the universal save will of god 1 timothy 2.4 for god must give enough grace to all to be save but only the elect who he foreknew be predestine and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantee heaven this do not mean that those without that grace be save it just mean that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them know they would not need it a they have freely chosen hell ^^^^^^^^^^^ people who be save be save by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it be god who dispose them to himself and predestine them to become saint but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they harden their heart and chose to perish thus they be deserve of god s punishment a they have reject their creator and sin against the work of the holy spirit well i would hold that a god most certainly give everybody some blessing for what good they have do even if it be only a little for those he bless in the next life he blesses in this one and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastise in this one or in purgatory for their sin every sin incurs some temporal punishment thus god will punish it unless satisfaction be make for it cf 2 samuel 12.13-14 david 's sin of adultery and murder be forgiven but he be still punish with the death of his child and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god 's judgement be quite prevelant in the bible sodom and gommorrah moses bar from the holy land the slaughter of the cannanites annias and saphira jerusalem in 70 ad etc not a good parallel but go to go with it anyway why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may or may not be more we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverb 24.11-12 but do that mean that christian should support a war in bosnia with the u.s. or even the u.n. involve i do not think so but i be an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventure in general but in the case of bosnia i frankly see no excuse for u get militarily involve it would not be a `` just war '' `` bless '' after all `` be the peacemaker '' be what our lord say not the interventionists our action in bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which be unrelated to anything to justify it for u"
b'julie it be a really try situation that you have described my brother be living with someone like that and thing be almost a bad although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problem with the relationship anyway the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together optimally in a room with nothing breakable lock the door behind you throw the key out underneath the door just a far a the long hand can reach you would like to get out after the conclusion i would imagine and hash thing out more than likely there will be scream cry and possibly hit unless of course someone decide to bring some rope to tie people down some of the best strategy in keep thing calmer would include have each individual own their own statement ie i feel that this relationship be hurt everyone involve because ... or i really understand where come from reinforce statement by paraphrase etc ie so you think that we do this because of ... well let me just say that the reason for this be ... accuse each other it be your fault that ... happen find a common ground about something lampshade really be decorational and functional at the same time guaranteed in a situation like this there be go to be some gunnysacking re-hashing topic which be assume resolve but be truly not and someone feel someone else be to blame however this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation without hold a smolder grudge the relationship really can work just a matter of keep thing smooth and even sort of like make a peace treaty between war faction you give one side everything there must be a compromise break can be take but communication between everyone involve must continue if the relationship here be to survive'

b"michael bushnell writes which be exactly what i point out though i be wrong about your use of the creed the 1913 catholic encylcopedia in which i read about it say the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque apparently that have change the athanasian creed have always have the filioque the nicene constantinopolitan do not of course the orthodox do not delete the filioque from the nicene creed it there to begin with but they certainly do from the athanasian creed which do have it from the begin i might point out that the whole problem start over the difference in way of explain the generation of the bless trinity the east emphasize the idea of the holy spirit proceed from the father through the son and the west use proceed from the father and the son in fact some such a tertullian use both formulation see below '' follow therefore the form of these example i profess that i do call god and his word the father and and his son two for the root and the stem be two thing but conjoin the fountain and the river be two kind but indivisible the sun and the ray be two form but coherent one anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds but it be not on that account separate from it where there be second however there be two and where ther be third there be three the spirit then be third from god and the son just a the third from the root be the fruit of the stem and third from the fountain be the stream from the river and thrid from the sun be the apex of the ray '' -tertullian against praxeas 8 5 about 213 ad and '' i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father through the son '' -tertullian against praxeas 4 1 about 213 ad and a st. thomas show in his summa theologica part 1 question 36 article 2 and 3 there be no contradiction between the two method of generation and in fact the two method of reckon the procession emphasize what st. augustine among others taught that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son but he proceeds from the father in a more preeminent way `` for whatever the son have he have from the father certainly he have it from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him ... for the father alone be not from another for which reason he alone be call unbegotten not indeed in the scripture but in the practice of theologian and of those who employ such term a they be able in a matter so great the son however be born of the father and the holy spirit proceeds principally from the father and since the father give to the son all that he have without any interval of time the holy spirit proceeds jointly from both father and son he would be call son of the father and of the son if which be abhorent to everyone of sound mind they have both begotten him the spirit be not begotten by each however but proceeds from each and both '' -st. augustine of hippo the trinity 15 26 47 400 to 416 ad so in a sense all of the formulation be correct to the west at least because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son but in proceed from the son the orgin of that procession be the procession from the father so the holy spirit be proceed from the father through the son but a all that the son have be from the father the holy spirit can be say to proceed from the father without any mention of the son be necessary in any case i be happy to know that i follow in the belief of pope st. leo i st. fulgence of ruspe st. cyril of alexandria pope st. damsus i st. augustine of hippo st. epiphanius of salami st. ambrose of milan st. hilary of poitier tertullian and others among the father who all have very quotable quote support the catholic position which i enunciate above a for the issue of the adoption of another creed be forbidden i will point out that the holy father of ephesus and chalcedon both spoke of the creed of nicea in their statement forbid anyone `` to produce write or compose a confession of faith other than the one define by the father of nicea '' that creed be a different creed than that of constantinople which be commonly call the nicene creed not of course in that they be condemn the adoption of the constantinopolitan creed which be but an enlargement upon the creed of nicea but that they be condemn the impious opinion of nestorious who have adopt a radically different creed from the one use by the church which among other thing deny the procession of the holy spirit form the son thus the addition of the constantinopolitan creed be not thought to be in violation of this and a the council chalcedon also affirm the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son which nestorius deny they could hardly have be against explain in a fuller way the creed for they themselves approve of previous addition to it and if the far explanation of the creed make in constantinople be not denigrate of the work do by the holy father of nicea or in any way heretical it follow that the council of toledo be fully able to add what be not dispute by the faithful to the creed so a to combat the impiety of the arians in spain because the filioque be not in dispute in the church until many year later under photius and others and that the filioque be not dispute i provide more quote below `` since the holy spirit when he be in u effect our be conform to god and he actually proceeds from the father and son it be abundantly clear that he be of the divine essence in it in essence and proceed from it '' -st. cyril of alexandria the treasury of the holy and consubstantial trinity thesis 34 423-425 ad '' the holy spirit be not of the father only or of the son only but he be the spirit of the father and the son for it be write if anyone love the world the spirit of the father be not in him and again it be write if anyone however do not have the spirit of christ he be none of his when the father and the son be name in this way the holy spirit be understood of whom the son himself say in the gospel that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and that he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you '' -pope st. damasus i the decree of damasus 1 382 ad '' the only-begotten holy spirit have neither the name of the son nor the appelation of father but be call holy spirit and be not foreign to the father for the only-begotten himself call him the spirit of the father and say of him the he proceeds from the father and will receive of mine so that he be reckon a not be foreign to the son but be of their same substance of the same godhead he be spirit divine ... of god and he be god for he be spirit of god spirit of the father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis like soul and body in u but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son a third by appelation ... '' the father always exist and the son always exist and the spirit breathes from the father and the son and neither be the son create nor be the spirit create '' -st. epiphanius of salami which be on cyprus the man well-anchored 8 and 75 374 ad '' concern the holy spirit i ought not to remain silent nor yet be it necessary to speak still on account of those who do not know him it be not possible for me to be silent however it be necessary to speak of him who must be acknowledge who be from the father and the son his source '' -st. hilary of poitier the trintiy 2 29 356 to 359 ad thus a i have point out before gaul spain italy africa egypt palastine and the land of the greek all of christnedom at that time all have father who can be cite to show that they confess the doctrine express by the filioque i suggest to those of the orthodox church that they come up with some of the father besides st. john of damascus who all will admit deny the filioque to support their view it be not enough to bring up the `` proceeds from the father '' line of the creed or the gospel of john for that say what we believe also but it do not say the holy spirit do not proceed from the son only that he do proceed from the father"

b"larry l. overacker writes respond to simon i may be interest to see some brief selection post to the net my understand be that sspx do not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicate but really beside the point what do the roman catholic church say excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication a provide for in canon law here 's some of the theology involve for the interested there be confusion over this issue of the sspx 's `` schism '' often the basic problem be lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the various classification of obedience first there be 2 important element involve here for my purpose 1 a command 2 the response make to the command a far a the command go command can be legitimate such a the pope order catholic to not eat meat on friday or they can be illegitimate such a the pope order catholic to worship the god dagon when every other full moon come around a far a the response to a command go it can be to refuse to do what be command or to comply make a table there be thus 4 possibilites command response name -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my 3 classification of obedience come from obedience be not solely a matter of compliance/refusal the nature of the command must also be take into account it be not enough to consider someone 's compliance or refusal and then say whether they be '' obedient '' or `` disobedient '' you also have to take into consideration whether the command be good or bad in my example if the pope command all catholic to worship the god dagon and they all refuse they be disobedient at all a far a the society of saint pius x go they be certainly refuse to comply with certain thing the pope desire but that alone be insufficient to allow one to label them `` disobedient '' you also have to consider the nature of the papal desire and there 's the rub sspx say the pope since vatican ii have be command certain very bad thing for the church the pope have of course disagreed so where be we be we in another arian heresy complete with weak pope or be the sspx priest modern martin luther well the only way to answer that be to examine who be say what and what the traditional teach of the church be the problem here be that very few catholic have much of an idea of what be really go on and what the issue be the religion of american catholic be especially defective in intellectual depth you will never read about the issue be discuss in the catholic press in this country on the other hand one italian catholic magazine i get -- 30 day -- have have interview with the superior general of the society of saint pius x many catholic will decide to side with the pope there be some soundness in this because the papacy be infallible so eventually some pope *will* straighten all this out but on the other hand there be also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the pope may indeed be wrong and such catholic be do nothing to help the situation by obey them where wrong in fact if the situation be grave enough they sin in obey him at the very least waste a great opportunity because they be fail to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he need this badly schism ... let 's move on to schism what be it schism be a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command all schismatics be disobedient but a superset so it work the other way around not all disobeyers be schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priest comply with the holy father 's desire make them schismatics so what be it that must be add to disobedience to constitute a schism maybe this something else make the sspx priest schismatics you must add this the rejection of the right to command look in any decent reference on catholic theology and what find the distinguish criterion of schism be rejection of the right to command here 's what the catholic encyclopedia say for example ... not every disobedience be a schism in order to posse this character it must include besides the trangression of the command of superior denial of their divine right to command from the ce article `` schism '' be the society of saint pius x then schismatic the answer be a clear no they say that the pope be their bos they pray for him every day and all that matter a far a schism go what all this boil down to be this if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objection their position be a legitimate one a far a the catholic theology of obedience and schism go they be resist certain papal policy because they think that they be clearly contrary to the traditional teach of the papacy and the best interest of the church in fact someone who find himself in this situation have a *duty* to resist now what be the stance of rome on all this well if you read the holy father 's motu proprio `` ecclesia dei '' you can find out the definitive document on the subject a motu proprio be a specifically papal act not the product of a roman congregation a letter that the pope have possibly never even read from the pope himself his bos be god ... there 's no one else to complain to in this document the holy father say among other thing 1 the episcopal consecration perform by archbishop lefebvre constitute a schismatic act 2 archbishop lefebvre 's problem be a misunderstand of the nature of tradtion both be confuse i fail to see the logic of the pope 's point a far a the episcopal consecration go i read an interest article in a translation of the italian magazine `` si si no no '' it all get back to the question of jurisdiction if episcopal consecration imply rejection of the pope 's jurisdiction then they would truly constitute a schismatic act justify excommunication under the current code of canon law but my problem with this be this accord to the traditional theology of holy order episcopal consecration do not confer jurisdiction it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacrament jurisdiction must be confer by someone else with the power to confer it such a the pope the society bishop know the traditional theology quite well take great pain to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacrament that require a bishop the `` si si no no '' article be interest in that it posit that the reason that the pope say what he do be that he have a novel post-vatican ii idea of holy order accord to this idea episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction i lent the article to a friend unfortunately so tell you more i believe they quote the new code of canon law in support of this idea the pope 's think on this point remains a great puzzle to me there 's no way there be a schism accord to traditional catholic theology so why do the pope think this a far a the point regard the nature of tradition go here's the passage in question the root of this schismatic act can be discern in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion incomplete because it do not take sufficiently into the account the living character of tradition which a the second vatican council clearly taught come from the apostle and progress in the church with the help of the holy spirit there be a growth in insight into the reality and word that be be pass on this come about in various way it come through the contemplation and study of believer who ponder these thing in their heart it come from the intimate sense of spiritual reality which they experience and it come from the preach of those who have receive along with their right of succession in the espiscopate the sure charism of truth but especially contradictory be a notion of tradition which opposes the universal magisterium of the church possess by the bishop of rome and the body of bishop it be impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while break the ecclesial bond with him to whom in the person of the apostle peter christ himself entrust the ministry of unity in his church papal motu proprio `` ecclesia dei '' 2 july 1988 it seem to me that the holy father be make two point here that can be simplify to the follow vatican council ii have happen i be the pope the argument be that either case be sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with them this be weak to say the least it would have help clarify thing more if the pope have address archbishop lefebvre 's concern in detail what be john paul ii's stand on the social kingship of christ a taught by gregory xvi pius ix leo xiii pius xi and pius xii for example be we suppose to ignore what all these pope say on the subject i know what the future will hold but the power that be in the sspx be still talk with rome and try to straighten thing out -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey '' justified disobedience '' or even `` obey god rather than man '' call a refusal to obey obedience put u into a sort of alice in wonderland world where word mean whatever we want them to mean similarly schism indicates a formal break in the church if the pope say that a schism exists it seem to me that by definition it exists it may be that the pope be on the wrong side of the break that there be no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortly be heal but how can one deny that it do in fact exist it seem to me that you be in grave danger of destroy the thing you be try to reform the power of the papacy what good will it do you if you become reconcile to the the pope in the future but in the process you have destroyed his ability to use the tool of church discipline one thing to hold that the pope have misuse his power and excommunicate someone wrongly something else to say that his excommunication do not take effect and the schism be all in his imagination that mean that act of church discipline be not legal tool but act whose validity be open to debate generally it have be liberal catholic who have have problem with the pope while they have often object to church sanction generally they have admit that the sanction exist you be now opening the door to people simply ignore papal decision claim to be truly obey by disobey and to be in communion while excommunicate this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say defines schism"
b"you fully explain the atheist position many theist believe that there be `` no proof of the existence of god '' but choose to believe in him anyway i yet found an argument for atheism that quickly be broken down to unprovable assumption this a problem with me everybody need to have a faith but if you believe that you can provide a `` purely logical '' argument for the nonexistence of god really like to see it ahh ... but when you use science and reason you have faith in certain belief of the scientific method -- for example the physical law of the universe be stable our observation of reality be a valid basis for a determination of truth objective reality exists logical argument be a valid way to answer all question can you prove any of these"
b'i have a hard time understand this attitude if the gospel be the least bit accurate then there can be little doubt that jesus belived hell be a reality a a teacher what would be the wise and love thing to do if people in your audience be head there to warn them it would however be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists and then remain quiet about it the only scenario i can envision in which dimished respect would be justified be if jesus knew there be no such place a hell and spoke about it anyway just to scare people unless you would accuse jesus of this i would encourage you to reconsider what a love response be when you perceive someone to be in danger'
b"the existence of repeat earth life and destiny karma do not mean that everything that happens be predetermine by past deed there be an oriental view of it that tends in that direction but i do not subscribe to that view god may choose one individual over another a the fit instrument for his plan but that do not preclude that the development of that individual into what he be in this earthly life be not the result of a longer course of development i do not and rudolf steiner do not subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable mechanistic karma determine everything that befalls one this be a kind of shrivel caricature of a much great law in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human be a a work of christ can be see a the master theme and indeed a new impulse that be completely free of karma christ incarnate only once in the flesh and in that he have no debt of karma or sin the oriental concept of reincarnation and karma which be even more trivialize and mechanize in some new age teaching incorrectly assume jesus christ to have be the reincarnation of a master avatar etc their teach of reincarnation and karma also have no concept the continue individuality from one life to the next e.g buddhism more important they have no concept of the resurrection of the body the ultimate continuity of the whole human be -- to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the last day there be another biblical passage that also have a bearing it be the tenth chapter of john devote almost entirely to the man born blind clearly here jesus tell the disciple that it be not his past karma or that of his parent that lead to his blindness but rather that a new impulse be to be reveal through him but note that he do not refute the disciple question in fact they ask it a a matter of course the question be state a if it be self evident that only one of two possibility exist it be either the sin of the man himself obviously not in this incarnation or the sin of his parent the fact that they even ask about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of christ 's answer indicates that he do not disagree with it there be also matthew 11:14 where jesus say straight out about john the baptist `` if you care to accept it he himself be elia who be to come '' this also emphasizes that the gospel do not have a positive teach either way about reincarnation -- or in fact about what happens to the human be at all between death and the last day even jesus do not push this teach on people who be not ready to embrace it `` if you care to accept it '' so i take care to point out not that the bible teach reincarnation but that it do not deny it either and that much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation be understood in the right way i pointedly use `` repeat earth life '' to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrine usually associate with the word `` reincarnation '' the phrase be rudolf steiner 's wiederholte erdenleben he note too that the idea need to arise a a new insight in the west completely free from eastern tradition it do in the eighteenth and nineteenth century the most important expression of it be lessing 's `` the education of the human race '' to return to your original point paul 's statement about jacob and esau do not contradict the idea of repeat earth life and karma and both of these principle receive their fulfillment in the incarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of jesus christ in my view"

b"i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that have be bother my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few year it seem that there be more and more ad hoc event during mass drive me crazy the most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition be that what happens be something we _all_ do together because we all know how to do it lead by the priest of course which make it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best mass be to be participatory prayer lately i think the proportion of participation have fall and the proportion of sit there and watch or listen or generally be told what to do which be necessary because no one know what 's happen next be grow example last sunday palm sunday we go to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion take the role of the mob the theology behind this seem profound -- when we say '' crucify him '' we mean it we do it and if he come back today do it again it always give me chill but last week we be `` invite '' to sit during the gospel =passion and _listen_ besides the orwellian `` invitation '' i be really sadden to have my and our little role take away this seem typical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward the musician reader and so on new thing be introduce in the course of the liturgy and since no one know what 's happen the new thing have to be explain and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the mass just sit there listen or space out in my case to how the mass be about to be do in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committee make up of lay '' expert '' but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee have a bias toward do something rather than nothing -- just a fact of bureaucratic life -- even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easy for people to be aware of the lord 's presence so be wonder -- be we the oddball or be the quality of the mass go down i mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and be remind of the power of a very simple liturgy to make u aware of god 's presence but a far a the obligatory sunday mass ... maybe i should just offer it up have anyone else notice decline congregational participation in catholic mass lately"

b'science do not progress via experimentation but by philosophise one aim of experiment be to investigate the validity of the hyptheses result from the model produce by this think process science have one advantage of all other approach to explain the world it be objective anything which affect the physical world can be study for example since we be part of the physical world anything include spirit which affect our behaviour can be observe science do not make any claim about the existence or non-existence of object which do not affect the physical world the purpose of science be to produce a model of the *physical* world the model must be able to explain all past observation and predict the outcome of future observation one of the aim of experiment be to carry out well define observation which be objective ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumption at the moment model which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world exist be equally powerful to one which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world a the non-spiritual model have few assumption it should be the currently accepted model the scientific process never assumes that it present model be the correct one whereas many religion claim to represent the truth the arrogance of many theist be that they claim to represent the truth this can not be say of scientist'

b"now this be get interest i be raise roman catholic before become an atheist so i have state this creed you quote nearly every sunday until i be about 18. for some reason i always take the 'resurrection in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul but i guess resurrection do strictly mean the raise of the physical body i have some question on this point 1. i always thought that christian believe the descent into hell be pretty much immediate and that there be people burning in hell right now you seem to be imply that it will not occur until after the '' great judgement '' which i read a meaning the proverbial judgment day i be always a little confuse on this point even when i be with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me where will my `` soul '' which by the way i believe in exist until that time 2. will the new body i will have be create out of the same atom that my body now be make of or will it be built from scratch my physical body now be susceptible to age etc -- so i guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be torture for all eternity 3. since i will have a physical body i assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where be this hell in the center of the earth do you think we could find it if we dig mark schnitzius schnitzi eola.cs.ucf.edu univ of central florida there be not complete agreement on the detail of the afterlife i think the most common view be that final disposition do not occur until a final judgement which be still in the future in the meantime some believe that people `` sleep '' until the final resurrection or because god be above time pas directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs while others believe that soul have a disembody pre-resurrection existence until then there be probably other alternative that omit the new body be generally conceive of be implement in a different `` technology '' than the current one one which be not mortal paul talk about the mortal be raise to immortality and jesus' resurrect body -- which be the first example -- clearly be not subject to the same kind of limitation a ours it be assume that there be enough similarity that people will recognize each other but i think most people claim to know the detail i think say the same atom assume there would be some analog of a physical place but i expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky suspect that in another dimension outside this physical world or whatever but again we have little in the way of detail"

b"the `` so sacred secret '' explanation be a bit mislead while there be a profound reverence for the temple endowment there be no injunction against discuss the ceremony itself in public but since public discussion be often irreverent most mormon would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice malign but there be certain element of the ceremony which participant explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself there be other interpretation to christian history in this matter one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostic be write by their enemy eusebius claim that jesus impart secret information to peter james and john after his resurrection and that those apostle transmit that information to the rest of the twelve eusebius _historia ecclesiastica_ ii 1:3-4 irenaeus claim this information be pass on to the priest and bishop _against heresies_ iv 33:8 but eusebius disagrees he claim the secret ceremony of the christian church perish with the apostle interestingly enough eusebius refers to the group which we today call gnostic a promulgator of a false gnosis eusebius op cit. iii 32:7-8 his gripe be not that thay profess *a* gnosis but that they have the *wrong* one writing deal with jesus post-resurrection teaching emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment a a policy of not teach certain thing indiscriminately in one story simon magus open a dialog with peter on the nature of god peter 's response be `` you seem to me not to know what a father and a god be but i could tell you both whence soul be and when and how they be make but it be not permit to me now to disclose these thing to you '' _clementine recognitions_ ii 60 if any one theme underlies the _recognitions_ it be the idea that certain doctrine be not to be idly taught but can be have after a certain level of spiritual maturity be reach now one can approach this and other such evidence in many way i intend that everyone interpret christian history a i do but i believe that evidence exists favorably interpret of course of early christian rite analogous to those practice by mormon today but if judaism and christianity have such ceremony would you expect to read about them in public document one can search the book of mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship yes you could establish that mormon worship in temple but you would probably be hard press to characterize that worship on that basis can we conclude that the bible explains *all* practice which might have take place and that absence of such description prof they do not exist mormon scholar dr. hugh nibley offer u a list of scripture from which i have take a few 1 `` it be give unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven but to them it be not give '' matt 13:11 2 `` all men can not receive this say save they to whom it be give '' matt 19:11 3 `` i have yet many thing to say unto you but ye can not bear them now '' john 16:12 4 `` the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverb but i shall shew you plainly of the father '' john 16:25 5 `` ... unspeakable word which it be not lawful for a man to utter '' 1 cor 3:1-2 6 `` many thing ... i would not write with paper and ink but i ... come unto you and speak face to face '' 2 jn 1:12 nibley _since cumorah_ pp 92-94 again these can also be interpret many different way i believe they serve to show that not all doctrine which could have be taught be actually taught openly historically joseph smith have be adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before join the freemason there be diary evidence which support a claim that the rite do not change after smith become a mason it can be argue that smith have ample exposure to masonic proceeding through the burlesque of his time and through his brother hyrum a mason though no specific connection have yet be establish my conversation with mason with respect to temple rite transcription which have appear on the net have lead me to believe that the connection from masonry to mormonism be fairly tenuous a our moderator note most of what be similar be remove in the recent revision to the temple ceremony i believe that critic who charge that mormon rite be lift from freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rite in question -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- jay windley university of utah salt lake city jwindley asylum.cs.utah.edu"
b"for src in most language the feast of the resurrection of our lord be know a the pasch or pasque or some variation thereof a word which come from the hebrew pesach meaning `` passover '' in english german and a few related language however it be know a easter or some variation thereof and question have be ask about the origin of this term one explanation be that give by the venerable bede in his de ratione temporum 1:5 where he derives the word from the name of an anglo-saxon goddess of spring call eastre bede be a great scholar and it be natural to take his word for it but he live 673-735 and augustine begin preach in kent in 597. the use of the word easter to describe the feast would have be well establish before the birth of bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discuss the subject with it seem likely that his derivation be just a guess base on his awareness that there have be an anglo-saxon goddess of spring bearing that name and the resemblance of the word thus if the say resemblance surely it be not surprising that a personification of spring should have a name similar to the word for dawn be not in istelf convincing the testimony or rather the conjecture by bede do not make it more so assume that bede be right that would not justify say that the christian celebration which after all have be go on for some century before the name easter be apply to it have pagan root it would simply mean that the anglo-saxon upon become christian and begin to celebrate the resurrection by a festival every spring call it by the name that to them meant simply `` spring festival '' however bede 's be not the only theory that have be propose j knoblech in `` die sprach '' zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft 5 vienna 1959 27-45 offer the follow derivation among latin-speaking christian the week begin with the feast of the resurrection be know a `` hebdomada alba '' white week since the newly-baptized christian be accustom to wear their white baptismal robe throughout that week sometimes the week be refer to simply a `` albae '' translaters render this into german mistook it for the plural of `` alba '' meaning `` dawn '' they accordingly render it a eostarum which be old high german for '' dawn '' this give rise to the form easter in english yours james kiefer"
b"like to share my thought on this topic of `` arrogance of christian '' and look forward to any response in my encounter with christian i find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith be total truth accord to them their belief come from the bible and the bible be the word of god and god be truth thus they know the truth this stance make it difficult to discus other faith with them and my own hesitation about christianity because they see no other way their way be the 'truth but i see their faith arise from a willful choice to believe a particular way that choice be part faith and part reason but it seem to me a choice my discussion with some christian remind me of schoolyard discussion when i be in grade school a kid would say `` all policeman be jerk '' ask `` how do you know '' `` because my daddy told me so '' `` how do you know daddy be right '' `` he say always right '' well the argument usually stop right there in the end we all just kid grope for the truth if so do we have the authority to declare all other belief besides our own a false -- -- -- -- -- -- this be only my third time browsing through this newsgroup i apologize if cover tire old ground some of the discussion on this topic have pique my interest and i welcome any comment -- sort of mystify about how a christian might respond to this i can understand criticism of christianity that say there 's not enough evidence to believe it or that there 's just a good evidence for other religion i agree but clearly there be plenty of intelligent people who find the evidence convincing but that seem to be your point rather you seem upset that people who believe christianity be true also believe that thing which contradict it be false this suggests a model of spiritual thing rather different than the christian one it sound more like an existentialist view where people choose what value to follow but there 's no actual independent spiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice be in some unique sense right this sort of model -- with modification of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religion but christianity be in it essense a `` historical '' religion that be base on the concept that there be actual spiritual entity out there that one of them have intervene in history in specific way and that we see evidence of that in history in the `` mundane '' world we be not free to choose how thing work when we drop something it fall aside from well-defined situation where it the christian concept be that spiritual matter there be also an actual external reality i hope all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understand but while we may not think we know everything we be confident that we know some thing and that implies that we think thing that contradict them be false i see how else we could proceed this need n't result in arrogance certainly interested in talk with people of other religion they may have thing to teach me and even if they i respect them a fellow human being but get to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matter they be wrong maybe even disasterously wrong"

b"why do you assume that jesus 's plea to his father `` to let this cup pas from him '' be merely a plea to escape death when i look at jesus in the garden i see a man-god who all his life have have the presense of his father with him a a result he knew every detail about his death long before the agony in the garden but a that hour approach he felt abandon by his father his presense diminish with each passing minute in addition it be brought more and more to jesus 's attention the betrayal of juda be probably a big impact that his suffer would be to no avail for many people especially those who would reject him not only then but in the future i truly believe that the majority of jesus 's suffer be mental and spiritual while the physical portion be only the tip of the iceburg btw we know from john 's account that jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king from john joh 6:14 after the people saw the miraculous sign that jesus do they begin to say `` surely this be the prophet who be to come into the world '' joh 6:15 jesus know that they intend to come and make him king by force withdrew again to a mountain by himself this do not seem like a man who would regret not become an earthly king no jesus knew his mission be to redeem all jew gentile people and establish his kingdom in the heart of those who would believe this be utterly mistaken much to jesus's dismay a an aspiration to some earthly kingdom but he knew what his father 's will be and follow it obediently even in the darkness of his passion"

b"for example why do the universe exist at all whether there be a `` why '' or not we have to find it this be pascal 's wager if there be no why and we spend our life search then we have merely waste our life which be meaningless anyway if there be a why and we .. suppose the universe be 5 billion year old and suppose it last another 5 billion year suppose i live to be 100. that be nothing that be so small that it be scary so by search for the `` why '' along with my friend here on earth if nothing else we so scar i find this view of christianity to be quite dishearten and sad the idea that life only have meaning or importance if there be a creator do not seem like much of a basis for belief and the logic be also appal `` god must exist because i want him to '' i have heard this line of `` reason '' before and wonder how prevalent it be certainly in modern society many people be convince life be hopeless or so the pollster and newscast state but i see where this be a good reason to become religious if you want 'meaning' why not just join a cult such a in waco the leader will give you the security blanket you desire"

b"actually i think there be any conflict if we really understand what these passage say first what be faith if you study the meaning of the greek and hebrew word so translate i think you will come to the conclusion that the word mean a *lot* more than mere belief faith mean both trust and action if you do not put your belief into action it simply can not qualify a faith i think this be what james mean when he say that `` faith without work be dead '' and `` i will show you my faith by my work '' remember james be write to `` the twelve tribe which be scatter abroad '' this probably mean he be write to those who would hear the gospel much later and understand the meaning of the original greek indeed i suspect james be write to u today among others he intend to reach paul on the other hand write mostly to the people of the roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the greek another key to why there be no conflict be to look at paul's statement in their context i think you will find that when paul contrast faith and work it be in the context of compare the gospel with the law meaning the law of moses this be the great burden of paul 's life a the apostle to the gentile he would go convert a bunch of people then the `` judizers '' would come along and try to convince them that they also have to obey the law of moses cf act chapter 15 in this context paul condemns the idea of be save by the work of the law say that we be save by the blood of jesus and our faith in him i believe that a well translation for today would be that we be save by *faithfulness* i think '' faithfulness '' today have a meaning closer to what the original writer intend i think you misunderstand roman what paul be really say be that god prefers a faithful gentile who do not `` keep kosher '' to a kosher jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matter of follow the lord and have charity toward his fellow in the sense of faith described above you can not have real faith and be lukewarm if you know god but be lukewarm unfaithful you be bad off than the person who never heard of him remember jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price mat 13:45-46 and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field mat 13:44 indicates that the price of the kingdom of god be *all* we have i agree with you in general include the fact that `` pistis '' have some of the force of `` faithful '' however if you take that too far you can end up with something that paul definitely would not have intend be faithful mean follow god in all thing to say that we be save by be faithful be very close to say that we be save by commit no sin i assume not what you meant i have almost give up on find a specific verbal formula that completely capture this however i think paul be describe what call a basic orientation include aspect such a trust and commitment jesus speaks of it a rebirth which implies a basic change we may still do thing that be sinful and may fail to show the new life in christ in many situation where we should but in any christian there have well be the basic change in orientation that jesus call be born again"

b"the problem with catholic liturgy be likely to continue for some time the problem be in a nutshell this the liturgy be a symbolic action in other word catholic do or should believe that the _signs_ during the mass water blessing vestment altar relic etc be real that be the sprinkle of water bestows real almost tangible holiness the vestment be a real indication of real sacred time the point of a _symbol_ be that it be understood by all to be connect to an underlie real referent this kind of think precludes analysis holy water be not holy because of anything it simply be holy but modern westerner find it extremely difficult especially if well- educate to think of the mass a a symbol we be more likely to see it a a _sign_ ie an action that represent grace but which could be replace with other sign in concrete term this mean the mass have become a commercial for god 's grace rather than the real thing you can mess around with a commercial in a way you dare with the real thing ask coca-cola co. these attitude have be encourage by liturgy workshop etc which instead of focus on _how_ to do do liturgy have focus on how to create a meaning in liturgy you can only create sign symbol have to come from god or the heart or somewhere deeper than analysis the most dramatic example of this shift in understand have be in the treatment of the sacred specie the consecrate host and wine now with pita bread etc it be common to come away from the altar with hand cover in particle if the host be a sign of grace this isnt and issue but catholic in the past would have be distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of jesus body modern catholic liturgy be caught in this epistemological shift we try to perfrom the old rite but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain what we be do so we stop do it and start pretend to do it this be not a soul fill experience it help btw that we have get stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music again a result of mis-analysis complicate tune be in fact easy to remember than simple one this be the genius of wesley and the 19c anglican hymn writer taize be only slightly well what be we to do well i suggest reject the parish system if it work for you search out a church where the liturgy be well prepared not well-explained they exist in every city this be not btw a matter of particular style the music might be old or new it be the attitude of the church that count also note that a conservative liturgy hark back to pre-vatican ii day do not necessarily mean the church will be socially conservative in nyc i can recommend corpus christi w 12st st. corpus christi w 12st st. very conservative liturgy st. joseph 's greenwich village modern `` clean '' largely gay oratorian church brooklyn very beautiful avoid anywhere anytime a church with electric candle happy easter christos aneste christos voskrezhne christ be risen"
b"the discussion begin why do the universe exist at all one of the law of nature specify cause and effect seem to dictate at least to this layman 's mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists i would argue that causality be actually a property of spacetime cause precede their effect but if you claim that there must be an answer to `` how '' do the universe our spacetime emerge from '' nothing '' science have some good candidate for an answer i have always wonder why christian use the `` there be question science or atheism can not answer '' argument i hope this be the appropriate group to ask this question the most popular question be the question of origin why do the universe exist or anything for that matter i think this question should actually be split into two part namely 1 why be there existence why anything exists and 2 how do the universe emerge from nothing it be clear science have nothing to say about the first question however be it a meaningful question after all i would say it consider the follow a die-hard skeptic be be it human or whatever attempt to doubt one 's very existence since it be so easy to doubt everything else i can not be

not exist can not doubt one 's existence a be that do exist can doubt one 's existence but this would be pointless the be would exist anyway let u return to the original question why a be that do not exist do not need any reason for it non-existence this be be not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind but let u assume that the world exists independent of the mind the objectivity postulate the question `` why anything exists '' can be counter by demand answer to a question `` why there be nothing in nothingness or in non-existence '' actually both question turn out to be devoid of meaning thing that exist do and thing that exist exist tautology at it best i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question some christian i have talk to have say that actually god be himself the existence however i see several problem with this answer first it inevitably lead to the conclusion that god be actually _all_ existence good and evil devil and angel u and them this be pantheism not christianity another answer be that god be the _source_ of all existence this sound much well but i be tempt to ask do god himself exist then if god be the source of his own existence it can only mean that he have in term of human time always exist but this be not the same a the source of all existence this argument sound like god do not exist but meta-exists and from his meta-existent perspective he create existence i think this be actually a nonsolution a mere twist of word the best answer i have heard be that human reason be incapable of understand such question be an atheist myself i do not accept such answer since i do not have any other method the second question how do the universe emerge from nothing belongs to the domain of science and i for one do not doubt the question can be answer by it method many cosmologist have suggest that it be entirely possible for universe to emerge from vacuum this possibility have be suggest in a recent hawk biography see also lizhi shuxian creation of the universe world scientific 1989 however i think the sci group be more appropriate for discussion like this a far a i can tell the very law of nature demand a `` why '' that true of something outside of nature i.e. *super*natural this be not true science be a collection of model tell u `` how '' not why something happens i can not see any good reason why the `` why '' question would be bound only to natural thing assume that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural being exist it be a appropriate to ask why they do so a it be to ask why we exist i believe the `` genetic code '' will be entirely decipher in our lifetime but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustain reproduce life *ever* never be much of a prophet though i even *picture* new york in my mind 8^ i believe *any* technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life despite have all of the part available just my opinion this opinion be also call vitalism namely that living system be somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate system do christian in general adopt this position what would happen when scientist announce they have create primitive life say small bacteria in a lab there be a problem with your prophecy artificial life have be create although not yet in a chemical form computer simulation of evolution contain system that be a much alive a any bacterium although their code be electronic a well a their metabolism see a recent book steven levy artificial life the quest for a new creation jonathan cape london 1992. artificial chemical life be just around the corner after all no spark of life have be found to be necessary living system do not violate any physical law a we know them you mind if a few of u send up a prayer on your behalf during your research do you after all if we of christ be delude ourselves you really have nothing to worry about eh exactly this be why i think atheist should _not_ post any evangelical atheist argument to soc.religion group since people who seek to find peace in religion must be allow to gather together i would normally have ask these question in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc but it seem many christian do not read these group petri"

b"golgotha the whole process of the fall of man this be precisely my point from a theological bent those who live immediately after the flood such a noah ham his son cush and his son nimrod have a much strong appreciation of divine wrath they also have a strong understand of the true god in fact this immediacy be a cause of hardship for some so much so that atlas who be see with heaven rest on his shoulder but this be not merely the physical heaven that he be lift it be to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at a distance and thus he become the `` elevator of the heaven '' this `` god '' make men able to '' feel '' a if heaven be afar off and `` a if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud or do not regard with displeasure the breaker of his law '' it be interest to see that it be that be title `` emancipator '' or `` deliverer '' or phoroneus it be nimrod who invade the patriarchal system and abridge the liberty of mankind yet be worship for have give many benefit he be a deliverer all right but not a we think of christ a a deliverer one deliver from a conscious feel of god 's wrath the other actually perform a delivery from god wrath and it be up to u to accept it a true i see the problem from the time of adam those who look forward to the come `` anoint one '' and put their faith in the fact that it be god who be to do the provision be account a righteous but up to the crucifixion their sin be only cover not take away therefore the dispensation of the church view the accountability of sin the same but see it a a complete action rom 's make it clear that it have always be salvation via faith and nothing else i understand what try to convey but i think lay hold of it because the scripture do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of say the church ruling with christ jn 17 tell u what eternal life be exactly a you be correct that it be much more than non-cessation of consciousness it depends upon your def of `` lose '' the elect be lose only in time a outside of time they have be chosen from the foundation of the world existentially we be all born `` lose '' but the `` righteous '' be `` in christ '' and therefore never *assuredly* lose maybe this summer i could find time to put together a paper on it i simply have to buy more book for myself and these old book be very expensive either that or countless trip to the oriental museum agree with you more our understand of say eschatology be clearly clearer than that of say isaiah but that be not what i be refer to no i understand it a you have say this be my point ah this be it this be the big question however i would say again i think that the best lie be one that have an appreciable amount of truth to it look at satan 's twist of god 's word when he coerce eve that be a very interest study the similarity in the midst of great variety of yes that be my point but it be a two edge sword for some do not want the underlie reality to be reveal they be not know a `` mystery '' religion for no reason there be the public side of them and there be the private side that be so protect that the initiate to an oath of death if they reveal that private side that be why it be so hard to bring their teaching to light the `` mystery of iniquity '' that we find in the bible correlate to this i think the primary object of the mystery be to introduce privately little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would not have be safe to openly profess be the true religion case in point today might be the mason just a note that they too worship osiris in egypt who can be trace to nimrod the `` husband son '' no i disagree with you here gerry i know what allude to in that the church primarily the rcc do endorse aristotelian philosophy into their worldview but i would disagree with you that it originate in greece if you be a student of history you will come to see that much of what greece come to expound to the world a their original be just an adulteration of that which they have take from conquer country the soul be clearly mention and discuss at length in the egyptian religion a be the unity of god and also the trinity of god see if you can find wilkinson 's `` egyptian '' he really do a number on what the greek do to what they `` pilfer '' from the egyptian not knock aristotle or plato or any other greek thinker it just that '' there be nothing new under the sun ''"

b"i agree entirely speak a an atheist heterosexual for what worth this be one of the least attractive part of some variety of christianity although sure possible to argue theologically that we make analogy between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation morally the case look unanswerable for those outside religion the three form _are_ analogous we discriminate on the basis of sex race or sexual orientation i found the moderator 's faq on the subject instructive and recommend everyone to read them there seem to be three different level of acceptance 1 regard homosexual orientation a a sin or evil whatever 2 regard homosexual behaviour a a sin but accept orientation though presumably orientation be unfortunate and dislike people who indulge 3 a 2 but `` love the sinner '' 4 accept homosexuality altogether my experience be that 3 be the most common attitude i imagine 1 and 2 be limited to a few fundamentalist sect i suppose i can go along with 3 except that i have this feel that a 14 -- 15 year old living in a community with this attitude on discover that they be more attract to member of the same sex would not feel the love of the community but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feeling not say that the community in particular the parent would not love the child but i suspect the child would not feel love"

b"first of all i resent your assumption that you know why i be threaten by science or even that i be threaten at all although i admit the latter the reason i be threaten by science have nothing to do with my need for proof of my lord 's existence -- god reveals himself in many way include to some degree science my problem with science be that often it allows u to assume we know what be best for ourselves god endow u with the ability to produce life through sexual relation for example but he do not make that availible to everyone do that mean that if science can over-ride god 's decision through alteration that god will for u to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have child should men be allow to have baby if that be make possible people have always have the ability to end life unnaturally and soon may have the ability to bring life into the world unnaturally the closest thing to artificially create life be artificially create death and a god have reserve judgement about when people should die to himself i believe we should rely on god 's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world this be not to say that i reject all form of medical treatment however treatment that alleviates pain or prevents pain from occur be perfectly acceptable i believe a it be acceptable for jesus to cure the sick however treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason or make unnecessary alteration to the body for mere aesthetic purpose go too far be we not happy with the beauty god give u i can not draw a solid line regard where i would approve of scientific study and where i would not but i will say this before one experiment with the universe to find out all it secret one should ask why they want this knowledge before one alters the body they have be give they should ask themseles why their body be not satisfactory too them a it be i can not make any general rule that will cover all the case but i will say that each person should pray for guidance when try to unravel the mystery of the universe and should cease their unravel if they have reason to believe their search be displease to god"
b"dear defiant or unfaithful or pixie i will take up the challenge to reply a i be a theist the foundation for faith in god be reason without which the existence of god could not be proven that his existence can be proven by reason be indisputable cf my short treatise `` traditional proof for the existence of god '' and summa theologica now give that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reason i assert that his command must be follow blindly although in our fall condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith why because god be the first cause of all thing the first mover of matter the independent thing that require nothing else for it existence the measure of all that be perfect and the essential be who give order to the universe logo i next assert that god be all good if this be so then that which be contrary to the will of god be evil i.e. the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by his promise of a savior a early a the protoevangelium of genesis 3:5 god instructs that because a human adam be first responsible for man 's alienation from the source of all good a man would be require to act to restore the friendship thus god become incarnate in the person of the messiah now this messiah claimed that he be the truth john 14:6 if this claim be true then we be bound by reason to follow him who be truth incarnate you next seem to have a problem with authority have you try the united state marine corp yet i can tell you first-hand that it be an excellent instructor in authority if you have not yet have the privilege i will reply that the authority which be truth incarnate may never be question and thus must be follow blindly one may not deny the truth for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton 's head he could have deny that it happen but he do not the law of physic must be obeyed whether a human like them or not they be true therefore the authority which be truth may not be deny qed -- boundary"
b"unfortunatly this seem to be how christian be taught to think when it come to their religion some take it to the extreme and say that their religion be the only one and if you accept their teaching then you be `` save '' it take quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks/wants especially when base upon your interpretation of a book the logic in the above statement be faulty in that it assumes two people with differ belief both be correct all about perception no two people be exactly alike no two people perceive everything in the same way i believe that there be one truth call it god 's truth a universal truth or call it what you will i believe god present this truth i think it be just there and up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir- ation dream or whatever just because people may perceive this truth differently it mean one be wrong and the other be right a an example take the question `` be the glass half empty or half full '' you can have two different answer which be contradictory and yet both be correct so for your belief to be true do not require everyone else 's belief to be wrong"
b"i sent in something on this before but i believe it get lose in the weekend accident the moderator described this be an improve version anyway so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detect forgery of ancient document be probably the write of friedrich blass `` hermeneutrik und kritik '' _einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen_ vol 1 of _handbuch der klassischen altertums- wissenshaft_ noerdlingen beck 1886 portion of this be described in nibley _the prophetic book op mormon_ pp 219-242 slc deseret book 1989 if you want to attempt reading this be forewarn nibley describes blass a a typical german scholar who claim little knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader nibley 's extract from blass 's work be in the form of `` rule for forger '' it make interest reading i confess that i have not read blass 's work only nibley 's extract thereof my german fall far short of what would be require and a far a i know there be no english translation available however i believe the technique he describes be know widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it be consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who write it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it be from that time and culture or be a later forgery actually there be 2 type of purportedly ancient document 1. allege actual holograph or early copy thereof for example the dead sea scroll these can be test by various scientific mean to determine the age of the paper ink and object found with them this can provide a pretty clear date of the actual physical object 2. document claim to be copy of ancient work although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find a document which monk in a monastary claim be a copy of something from century ago perhaps even have be through several generation of copists this be more of a problem but can still be test although the test be not likely to be simple we can not expect a test of the age of the physical object to tell u much so we must confine our test to the text itself it be important to remember that none of these test can tell u if the document be really what it claim to be they can only date the document and identify it culture of origin for example heard of a letter suppose to have be write by jesus himself to a king in what be now iraq if this document be to actually turn up scholar could date the paper and ink assume they have the holograph they could check the language content and write style to see if they be consistent with what would be expect of a palestinian jew of that time however even if all test result be positive there be no way to determine if jesus himself actually write it we would know what time and culture it come from but bar a know sample of jesus handwrite or other clue for comparison scholarship must stop there there be seldom any way to determine who the actual author be a i say no expert on blas 's work i do remember some of the test which can be apply to allege copy of ancient work specifically we might ask 1. be the document internally consistent do it contradict itself if the work it be short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it be a forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it be to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forger stick to short document 2. be it consistent with the history and geography of the time again a short non-specific work might not be testable but if the write be of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous thing which someone from that culture would get right without even think about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil be in the detail 3. what about the literary style of the work figure of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in way that seem strange to u be there any such odd phrase in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there be complication if the document have be translate or possibly even if somebody just update language when he copy it a few case of language not from the culture claimed may be allow in recent copy they cause problem and reduce certainty to be sure but necessarily prove forgery these test can be quite effective give enough material to work with but they be not easy they require the skill of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the question to ask be `` be every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin '' if there be thing which fit how significant be they be problem area due to our lack of knowledge later change by copists or be they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture"
b"undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reason but i suspect that a biggie be that the god they 've believe in be in j.b. phillips 's word `` too small '' if a person 's understand of god be not allow to grow and develop it will eventually become inadequate the grey-haired gentleman on a throne who be a comfort image in childhood becomes a joke a therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her client that they `` fire god '' what she mean by that be let go of an inadequate understand of god to make room for a fuller one but she follow up by encourage them to '' hire a new one '' my guess be that a lot of folk go through the fire process but be not adequately support in the subsequent re-hire"

b"note that i say the fall of rome not of the empire the roman empire last until 1453 with it transfer capital in constantinople the main reason for fall be not so much the sack of constantinople by the men of the 4th crusade who be not christian they have be excommunicate down to the last man after attack the christian city of zara in croatia but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of mazinkert after the turk breach the frontier it be only a matter of time before the empire fell the inability of the empire to hold onto the rim of anatolia with the ottoman and rum seljuk in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history the sack of constantinople only hasten the inevitable along for if the greek have want to save their empire why would they not cooperate with the crusader when they come to do battle with the saracen in the 1st-3rd crusade because of their obstinacy over cooperate with people they consider heretic even though those `` heretic '' be fight for the cause of the empire and christendom in do battle with the turkish horde in anatolia edessa lebanon palastine and syria the some horde who be to later sack constantinople and overrun a third of europe the balkan hungary the ukraine the caucasus etc"

b'that would be neat but nowhere in the bible do it say that one who have the gift of tounges can do this if the gift of tounges be the ability to be understood by everyone no matter what language they know there would be no need for the gift of interpretation and i corinthian 14 would not have have to have be write a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million christian world wide sure there be some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges just a there be among those who do not have this gift there be people like this in the corinthian church also that do not mean that there be no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men i would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges do so more often in private prayer than in public link hudson'
b"ddavis cass.ma02.bull.com dave davis ii the deuterocanonicals be not in the canon because they be not quote by the nt author that be not quite accurate otherwise we would have the book of enoch in the canon a dave note one can say that the apocrypha be not quote by christ iii the deuterocanonicals be not in the canon because they teach doctrine contrary to the uncontroverted part of the canon then i answer these be a logically invalid *a priori* besides we be talk about ot texts- which in many part be supercede by the nt in the xtian view would not this same principle exclude _ecclesiastes_ this principle can not be consistently apply i have to reject your argument here the spirit speaks with one voice and he do not contradict himself the ultimate test of canonicity be whether the word be inspire by the spirit i.e. god-breathed it be a test which be more guide by faith than by reason or logic the early church decide that the apocrypha do not meet this test -- even though some book such a the wisdom of ben sirach have their us for example the lutheran hymn `` now thank we all our god '' quote a passage from this book the deutero-canonical book be add much later in the church's history they do not have the same spiritual quality a the rest of scripture i do not believe the church that add these book be guide by the spirit in so do and that be where this sort of discussion ultimately end"

b"the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m. smith d.d 1894-1977 when jesus be on earth he make an amaze prediction about himself and frequently repeat it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priest and unto the scribe and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentile to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again '' matthew 20:18-19 wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who have *never* do anything worthy of death even deserve reproval knew he would die before he be 40 year of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leader of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death take place he would be mocked and scourge he knew exactly how he would die -- *by crucifixion all this be in itself remarkable but more amaze than the minute particular of his foreknowledge be what he predict would follow shortly after he be bury -- *that he would rise again he even designate the time -- on the third day but since it be on this central fact -- the death and resurrec- tion of jesus christ -- that the whole truth or untruth of chris- tianity turn let u examine it more closely the body of jesus be embalm in long sheet of cloth between the layer of which a great abundance of spice and ointment be distribute the body be place in a tomb which have never before be use and a great stone be roll against the entrance the jewish authority fully aware that jesus have predict he would rise again have the stone officially seal and on saturday place a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciple from carry away the body early sunday morning some of the woman who be faithful follower of christ go out to the tomb to far anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone roll away the body go they rush back to tell the disciple shortly two of jesus friend peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair come and found the tomb empty just a the woman have say even the guard come hurry into the city to tell the sanhedrin that have hire them to guard the tomb that the body be go matthew 28:11 how do this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholar in america -- professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary -- write to the author in answer to my question of *how* the tomb become empty and write it in a letter *not* marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb become empty than he could explain how santa claus come down the chimney at christmas time but he realize that santa clause never do come down any chimney at christmas time *because there never be a santa claus ... and there *is* a jesus he die he be bury in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body be go those be fact of history no one can escape the responsi- bility of come to some conclusion about what really happen by mention a myth we all abandon before we be eight year old another professor dr. kirsopp lake of harvard university try to explain the empty tomb by say what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism have venture to adopt that the woman go to the wrong tomb the fact be these first so far a we know there be no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have go second it be contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have bury their dearest love one within less than three day even if the woman do miss the tomb when peter and john come do they too go to the wrong tomb third be the soldier *guarding* the wrong tomb there be of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they be go behold some of the watch come into the city and show unto the chief priest all the thing that be do and when they be assemble with the leader and have take counsel they give large money unto the soldier say say ye his disciple come by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor 's ear we will persuade him and secure you so they take the money and do a they be taught and this say be com- monly report among the jew until this day matthew 28:11-15 this be a good illustration of many later attempt to escape the fact that the tomb be empty you will notice at once that the chief priest and the elder never question but that the tomb *was* empty they never even go out to see if what the guard have report be true -- they *knew* it be true another fact about this story make it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb be empty -- the soldier be told to say that jesus disciple come and stole the body away *while they* the soldier *were asleep how could they know what be go on while they be asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make u reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciple compel u to believe they do not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first a professor heffern point out the leader of judaism in jerusalem who have put the lord jesus to death have nothing to offer to contradict these disciple a they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection -- because all jerusalem knew the tomb be empty if there have be trickery here sooner or later it would have be suspect then prove second surely *one* of the disciple even *most* of them would have confess the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie -- and most of these men do the result ultimately would have be that the message that christ have risen would have suffer the fate of all such unfounded story -- it would have lose it *power instead this truth swept the world close pagan temple won million of disciple brought hope to a despair humanity be the very foundation truth of the early church and be today a believable and a freshly glorious a ever but not only do jesus come alive again he do not disappear to leave the disciple speculate through all the subsequent day a to what have happen to him instead he appear to them -- literally visibly frequently he appear to the woman at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew 28:1-10 later that day to mary magdalene alone john 20:11- 18 and to simon peter also alone luke 24:34 in the afternoon he walk with two of his follower toward emmaus luke 24:13-35 and that night he appear to ten of the apostle gather together in an upper room at jerusalem mark 16:14-16 luke 24:36-40 etc. a week later he appear to all eleven of the apostle probably at the same place john 20:26-28 once he be see by above 500 brother on a mountain in galilee i corinthian 15:6 and finally to the apostle just before his ascension mark 16:19 luke 24:50-52 act 1:3- 8 a with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor- ically record appearance all kind of theory have be propose attempt to deny their literalness but these theory be unreasonable without support evidence none have ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearance moreover while it be true we be living in an age when may of our lead scientist and agnostic and many of our philosopher be antisuperanaturalistic let u not forget that some of the great thinker of the age have firmly believe in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton -- these men and countless others have believe it but suppose christ *did* rise from the dead what of it what have it to do with *my* life what have it to do with *your* life just this it seal with certitude the teaching of christ jesus taught many great truth -- especially many about himself he claimed to have come down *from* god he say he be the way *to* god he say he be the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he say that whoever believe on him have eternal life and no one else have it he say that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to u thus when he do rise from the grave on the third day he reveal that in these amaze unparalleled prediction *he spoke the truth do you know any reason *any good reason why we should not believe that his word be all true the point be do not the truth of the resurrection convince u that he be none other than the one he claimed to be -- the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rise from the dead testifies that he have broken the power of death and that he will some day raise u also up from the grave a he promise in other word if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he say a life built on him would know forgiveness of sin his compan- ionship and help a joy that no circumstance can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day"

b"here be some note about what the church be to be like and some helpful idea about how to choose a church colossian 1:15-18 a. jesus be the head of the body the church b. you can not say `` yes '' to jesus but `` no '' to the church ephesian 2:19-22 a. the church be the family of god b. the church be base on the word of god only cornerstone=christ foundation= apostles=new testament prophets=old testament see revelation 21:9-14 1 corinthian 12:12-13 a. baptism be when we become a member of the church a for the question of denomination a. the bible teach that there be only one church from ephesian 4:4-6 roman 12:4-5 1 corinthian 12:12-13 b 1 corinthian 1:10-13 say that there should be no division in the church there should be no follow of personality in the church and in time their writing c. there be so many church today because of a problem 2 timothy 4:1-4 say that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teach a doctrine that suit their lifestyle hebrew 10:24-25 a. do not miss church b. purpose be to encourage each other so we will remain faithful involve on a relationship level in the church c. must come to all service another verse which be helpful be hebrew 3:12-15. the church should be encourage daily a it be their duty to do of course more standard apply 1 timothy 4:16 people in the church should be watch their life and doctrine to make sure they both live up to the word entirely ie disciple act 17:10-12 the pastor do not come close to the apostle paul natural conclusion since the apostle paul talk with jesus directly face to face so if the bereans who be consider noble take paul at his word but checked out what he say with scripture to verify his statement then church member be to do the same and verify the pastor 's statement if they be not verifiable or valid in light of other verse then that group should be avoid a a church would've make a wonderful suggestion to the waco group especially in light of matthew 24"

b"believeing blindly or not not sure how blindness come into it i do not deny reason indeed i insist upon it but reason only draw conclusion from evidence if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical sens then you cut reason off from any possibility of reach a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the rather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphere be not self explanatory so your be say to rely on our feeling and experience since this be the only other source of information left to u how can you then convince somebody that your `` feeling and experience '' be the correct one then if you show somebody visible and measurable effect if my experience say that `` there exists no god '' and yours say there do where do that leave u since we be only go on experience then both of u be correct within our own personal reality furthermore the trouble with `` feeling and experience '' be that they can lead you astray a the tragic outcome of waco illustrates i be sure that many of koresh 's follower really believe in him but i think that you and i will agree that they be be mislead finally how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere be not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five sens you must be use a definition of `` evidence '' that i be not familiar with to me evidence be something you can show others -unambiguously- that what you be say be true however i agree with you that belief in a diety be a matter of faith it be not something you can share around others must experience it independantly unfortunately a i have explain above this put belief down to a matter of experience my impression be that christian do not have the monopoly on reason evidence and faith a far a any of these thing can go at the risk of repeat my argument a i have explain previously the trouble be that moslem buddhist jew etc will all say that they claim with good reason to be a valid system possess of the best evidence for explain god revelation to man for buddhist it should read `` for explain the non-existence of god '' so not only must you `` prove '' your own case you have to `` disprove '' theirs alt.messianic be a good place to see people strong in the belief of their own faith ... and with their own good reason i know that all people can use reason ... i never claimed that they i just wish to make sure that their argument be well-founded it go without say that if i make a blunder that i expect people to correct me once we have all go through this process of remove the non-essential and contradictory bit we should hopefully have make some progress towards the truth"

b"i dream that the great judgment morning have dawn and the trumpet have blown i dream that the sinner have gather for judgment before the white throne oh what weep and wail a the lose be told of their fate they cry for the rock and the mountain they prayed but their prayer be too late the soul that have put off salvation '' not tonight i 'll get save by and by no time now to think of ... ... religion '' ala he have found time to die and i saw a great white throne now some have protest by say that the fear of hell be not good for motivation yet jesus thought it be paul thought it be paul say '' know therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men '' today too much of our evangelism be nothing but soft soap and some of it be nothing but evangelical salesmanship we tell people anymore that there 's such a thing a sin or that there 's such a place a hell a jayne have say this mean we have to come on so strong so a to hit people over the head with a baseball bat yet the fact remains there be a place call hell a place so fearful that god die to save u from have to experience it whatever you or i a christian do we should do whatever we can to win people to the lord if for no other reason to keep them from go to `` outer darkness. '' jesus in mt 25 tell u that he prepare hell for people he prepared it for the devil and his angel no where in the bible do i read -anywhere that god predestine anybody to go to hell d.l moody use to say that the elect be the `` whosoever will '' and the nonelect be the `` whosoever wont 's '' whether or not theologically sound i defend but it practical jesus say to the people of israel `` ye would not '' now some of you may not be student of the bible heck -some of you may not be christian have you ever say to somebody `` i believe in hell i believe in the religion of jesus '' but do you know that jesus talk more about hell than he do about heaven `` oh i believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount '' you find hell taught by jesus in the sermon on the mount read that jesus talk about the tree be cast into the fire several time he talk about hell and about judgment in fact over and over in the synoptics matthew mark and luke jesus talk about hell not isaiah not moses not john the baptist though he do but jesus the son of god the great beloved one preach about hell because he love people and want to see them go there now if there be no hell then jesus preach in vain it be our lord jesus not some angry baptist preacher that say `` where the worm never dy and where the fire never go out '' jesus say that it be jesus who call hell a `` furnace of fire '' it be jesus that use the word `` condemnation '' `` and this be the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deed be evil jesus say that how can we get it across to you that a love die jesus preach about hell not only that but he go through hell what calgary be all about when my lord be on the cross darkness fell he call hell `` outer darkness '' do you have this idea that hell be a place where the gambler be gamble over here the drunk be get drunk over there and the prostitute be prostitute their body over there not what hell be hell 's not a party there 's no fellowship there he call it `` outer darkness '' `` outer '' -away from god `` darkness '' -god be light no when he be on the cross he be make sin for you and for me god treat jesus the way sinner have to be treat be a sober thought a my son would say an `` awesome '' thought `` my god my god why hast thou forsaken me '' hell be isolation there 's no fellowship in hell there 's no friendship in hell there 's no love embrace in hell there 's no hand shake in hell there 's no word of encouragement in hell `` i thirst '' it go much deeper than physical thirst hell be eternal crave with no satisfaction the man whose life be live for drug will crave it eternally the man whose life be live for the lust of a woman 's body will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied one theologian have put it this way and i think it deserves merit what be hell hell be just the kind of environment that match the internal condition of the lose in a recent post i be try to remember the founder of the word of life ministry remember his name jack wertzen and found that the illustration that i give his his illustration be that he be talk to his barber and his barber 's wife and daughter have just recently be save and he be comment about it to jack `` they sing these song and read bible verse and their praise this and that -i stand it jack do you think god would send me to hell '' jack answer by say `` yes i think he would '' of course the barber say `` what do you mean by that '' `` well if you stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymn and praise to god now what would you do in heaven where do it for eternity be miserable because god love you put you where it would match what you really be '' it make a man think the crucifixion of jesus christ be a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross he perform an eternal act ask me how i know but he be god and he be the infinite/eternal and when he die he die an infinite/eternal death it be by that eternal act that he purchase eternal life for the `` whosoever will '' he suffer eternal judgment a lot of people would like to detour around hell by say `` everybody be go to be save eventually '' -universalism my bible say no separate them the sheep from the goat `` .after you die there 's a probationary period in which god prepares you for heaven '' no my bible say that `` it be appoint unto men once to die and then come judgment '' some of the cultist believe in annihilation after you die sssswish just like a mosquito squish out no in rev we be told that their be eternal existence in hell just a there be in heaven i enjoy make these kind of statement and maybe you enjoy listen to them but we have to preach the entire word of god -there be a place call hell if i could give one verse of scripture that could give any hope that people go there give it to you but i found it that fact that there be a place call hell the fact that our god be a god of holiness and must judge sin the fact that he have make u the kind of creature we be and therefore responsible the fact that he have place u in a `` uni '' verse that have purpose and design behind it the fact that sin be such an awful thing and the fact that god himself go through hell to save u from hell lead u to two application 1 a already mention if you be a christian you must worn others it not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge be out `` know therefore the terror of lord we persuade men '' 2 if you accepted jesus be your savior take an awful chance a i say to the jehovah witness who no longer frequent my door if you be right and i be wrong then i will have live a good life and will die and cease to exist but if i be right and you be wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation i mean to make fun at this point but it like dirty harry say `` get to ask yourself 'do i feel lucky well do you '' `` a man 's get to know his limitation '' be

b"do you count yourself a one who be weak in the faith be there any doubt in your mind about what be right and what be miss the mark be they clear or do you have doubt an important first step the realization that paul be human yes and he be write and speak for an audience that be at best very weak in the faith most could not read most be unfamiliar with the hebrew scripture in even the septuagint form paul adapt the message of the bible to a largely uneducated market grant this market still exists today but do you count yourself a part of it to be `` weak in the faith '' be not miss the mark hamartia if you do the best that your education allows be you do the best let me make clear that the `` law '' be none other than the pentateuch of genesis exodus leviticus number deuteronomy what do jesus say about the `` law '' in matt5:14-19 where do jesus say that the `` law '' only applies to jew and that gentile be above the `` law '' who acknowledge this fact on what basis be we extra-biblical at this point why not also acknowledge that the bhagavad-gita be the only relevant text for gentile after all we see in the bible that it be magus from the east who observe the star-signs of jesus why bother with any text at all why not just follow whatever the church have to say i see how you can say this with a straight face be you a follower of christ or do you follow someone else be you say that the word of jesus only apply to jew how jewish be paul after he change his name from saul who say gentile christian be not cover by the first five book who say that gentile christian be above the ten commandment imply that jesus word be valid only for jew be this really what you mean to say you do realize that you be gutting rather large portion of the bible when you read jesus word do you ever consider that maybe just maybe jesus be talk to you no matter what your race or sex if the hebrew scripture and the gospel account of jesus be only direct to jew why be they translate into english a paul would call him one who be weak in the faith which be more important 1 the record word of jesus or 2 indication that you can deduce from the bible be jesus god only of the jew or god of all humankind of all race and sex this be your understand of paul compare this to the word of jesus be you christian or pauline again this be your understand of paul do jesus say that the law be an `` impossible standard '' do jesus say that he supercede the law be you christian or pauline you acknowledge that it be *your* reading of paul what do jesus say can you deny that matt5:14-19 be quite clear in it meaning be you christian or pauline when do jesus say that the purpose of the law be conviction of sin please reread matt5:14-19. be you christian or pauline be you say that the ten commandment be ceremonial detail you call observance of the sabbath the day on which the lord rest ceremonial have circumcision be supercede for christian ... be you christian or pauline both there be no doubt in my mind about what be sin and what be not at least not in this case jesus do not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law be binding on gentile why i have to cite evidence such a the way jesus dealt with the centurion a to general jewish view on this i be dependent largely on study of pauline theology one by h.j schoeps and one whose author i come up with at the moment both author be jew also various christian and non-christian jew have discuss the issue here and in other newsgroups mat 5:19 be clear that the law be still valid it do not say that it applies to gentile and yes i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandment be a ceremonial detail when look at the obligation of gentile similarly circumcision not sure quite what else i can say on this subject again unfortunate the jesus answer the question directly however we do know 1 what the 1st cent jewish approach be 2 how jesus dealt with at least one gentile and 3 how jesus disciple dealt with the issue when it become more acute refer to act 15 more than paul give that these be all in agreement i see that there 's a big problem"

b"biblical basis for the immaculate conception 1 `` i will put enmity between you the serpent and the woman and between your seed and her seed she can also be read he shall crush your head and you shall bruise her or his heel '' -genesis 3.15 2 `` he who commits sin be of the devil ... '' -1 john 3.8 3 `` hail full of grace greek kecharitomene the lord be with thee ... '' -luke 1.28 from the above we prove the doctrine of the immaculate conception first god have give the proto-evangel in genesis 3.15 which be the first promise of a savior who will redeem mankind from the wile of satan `` satan be a murderer from the begin and have not stood in the truth because there be no truth in him '' john 8.44. now the proto-evangel promise several thing enmity between satan and `` the woman '' and enmity between satan and `` her seed '' now the woman be both eve who be the immediate point of reference and mary the second eve `` her seed '' be jesus christ and he be also at enmity with satan in the same way a mary be say to be at enmity with satan thus know a we do that jesus christ be sinless hebrew 7.26 we can conclude that mary be also sinless because if she she would 1 not be at enmity with the devil a 1 john 3.8 tell u and 2 the relation of her sinlessness to christ 's sinlessness would be call into question a would god 's veracity for god promise an enmity between mary and the serpent and it be not possible for god to lie or be decieved second we have the angelic greet where mary be call by the archangle gabriel `` full of grace '' a i point out above this be from the greek word `` kecharitomene '' which mean not just full of grace but a plenitude or perfection of grace the sense of it be best grasped by the footnote to the jerusalem bible `` hail you who have be and reamin fill with grace '' but that be a little to long to say so it be reduce to full of grace and a it say `` you who have be '' mary have always be fill with grace from the moment of her conception which be also the moment of her salvation until her death some year later it must be admit that it be possible that god could have do what the doctrine of the immaclute conception say he do do and if god could keep himself free from any contact with sin through his mother he would have and the bible record this fact to which the father of the church such a st. john damascus st. augustine of hippo st. ambrose and others be in complete agreement with a be all of christian tradition and a be the infallible declaration of the pope on the matter in `` ineffibilus deus ''"

b"koberg just a couple of minor correction here ... 1 the church of christ do not usually believe in speak in tongue in fact many of them be know for be strongly oppose to pentecostal teach you be probably think of church of god in christ the large african-american pentecostal denomination 2 not sure what you mean by `` signify believer '' but it should be point out that the assembly of god do not now nor have it ever held that speak in tongue be the sign that one be a christian the doctrine that traditional pentecostal include the a/g maintain be that speak in tongue be the sign of a second experience after become a christian in which one be `` baptize in the holy spirit '' that may be what you be refer to but i point this out because pentecostal be frequently label a believe that you have to speak in tongue in order to be a christian such a position be only held by some group and not the majority of pentecostal many pentecostal will quote the passage in mark 16 about `` these sign follow them that believe '' but they generally do not interpret this a meaning if you pactice the sign you '' save '' 3 i know hard to summarize the belief of a movement that have such diversity but i think make some pretty big generalization here do `` neo-pentecostals '' only believe in tongue a a sign and tongue a prayer but not tongue a revelatory with a message never heard of that before in fact i would have characterize them a believe the same a pentecostal except less likely to see tongue a a sign of spirit baptism also while neo-pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongue in the non-pentecostal church they attend they do have their own meeting and in many case a whole church will be charismatic"
b"again i find myself want to respond to a post and have neither the time nor the proper material with me you would think i would learn my lesson by now -- but try to finish write my thesis and have ton of time anyway ... the basis for our the catholic church 's belief in the assumption of mary body and soul into heaven be that to put it simply the apostle and all the early generation christian believe it in fact throughout their ministry the apostle kept in close contact with mary and 11 of the 12 be present when she die only thomas be miss -- when he arrive several day later he ask to be show her body and move with pity peter and several of the other apostle brought him to her tomb when they arrive the seal be still unbroken they broke the seal enter and the body be miss there be no sign that anyone have enter forcibly or otherwise and everything else be laid out exactly a it have be left the apostle present all believe that mary be assume into heaven -- and the apostle taught this in their preach of course this do not appear in any of the text currently consider part of the bible but it do appear in other writing left behind by several of them basicaly a an apostolic church ie found by the apostle we believe that the teaching of the apostle whether write down in the bible or write down in other source be true provide that the authenticity of those other source can be confirm at least in the case of the assumption of mary the authenticity be quite clear"

b"a far a i can see one of the big difference between davidians and christian be in who they follow i have sometimes try to put myself in the foot of one of jesus 's disciple basically they give up a lot -- career possibly family and well a whole bunch to follow jesus so what be the difference it be quite plain jesus be good and david koresh be not the problem be i think be that we try to legislate what be good and what be bad in term of principle for instance there be thousand of law in the u.s. govern what be legal and what be not often it be hard to bring people to justice because it be not possible to find a legal way to do it if only we could trust judge to be just then we could tell them to administer justice fairly and justice would be follow but since judge always get it right we have a complicate system involve precedent and bunch of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect the justice of man into something perfect but what i hear about the justice system in the u.s. tell me that quite the opposite be true there be also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material be present so we might consider a rant christian to be bad but an eloquent person from another religion to be good this go along with the american desire to protect the constitution at all cost even if it allows people to do bad thing i think that it be the message that be important if a man be present a false message even if he be ever ever so mild mannered then that man be perform a tremendous disservice i know that i be ramble here i guess that what i be try to say be that we be look for principle that tell u why the davidians get it wrong it be not wrong to follow and worship a person but it be important to choose the right person it be simple choose jesus and you get it right choose anyone else and you get it wrong why because jesus be the begotten son of god and nobody else be jesus be without sin and nobody else be"

b"the concept of god a a teacher be indeed interest do he grade on a curve do he cheat that be interest not to mention thought provoke my own concept be that he be a father and we be his child in that he love u with a love that we can never understand until we be with him the bible say that he look on the heart a the final measure from that perspective in a grade context the heart be the final test specifically most christian would agree that there be only one heaven and one hell from that perspective it be heaven or hell you either go to one or the other the `` grade '' on a pass/fail basis be do by god the father with intervention by jesus the son not by others for only god see the heart the bible say of the heart `` ... who can know it '' i would say there have always be and always be an unchanging method that be what make a relationship with christ so secure in an uncertain and ever change landscape he be always the same yesterday today and tomorrow concern whether or not our childhood be considerd a part of the test my own conviction be no be that the case i certainly be go to heaven the bible speaks very plainly about the love and care jesus have for and about child the reality be that we be all child some of u just have big body and grey hair but the father our father be always there like most father he want only the best for his own there maybe decipline but there be more love sometimes look like christianity be a test to see who make it and who those who do pass=heaven and those who go to the other place but it be really much more than that ... there be few expert most of u be just traveler look for the light and the way home pray that we can bring others with u"
b"darren in an earlier article i explain that what many people find darren arrogant about christian be that some christian profess darren absolute certainty about their belief and doctrine and darren in short the problem be that no matter how good your source darren be if any part of your doctrine or belief rest on your own darren think and reason then those doctrine be suspect the point that darren raise be a very lutheran viewpoint while reason be a gift from god it be also infect by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely -- and neither i think do darren we need reason a darren himself have point out to comprehend god 's revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone be not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word we need first and foremost faith for `` the sinful mind be hostile to god it do not submit to god 's law *nor can it do so* '' roman 8:7 luther accepted scripture a the sole mean of revelation `` sola scriptura '' but accepted the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehend that revelation yet luther also say regard baptism `` but mad reason rush forth and because baptism be not dazzle like the work which we do regard it a worthless '' large catechism fourth part baptism to make matter more complicate luther be the sort of theologian that many people would describe a an absolutist see him described a a take no prisoner theologian we might conclude give these observation that luther be inconsistent or mad and surely at least some have come to that conclusion but it might be useful to recall that jesus be also call mad and peter felt compel to defend himself and the apostle against a charge of drunkenness on pentecost so we a christian ought to be careful about reject luther or others a mad rather we should imitate the bereans who examine the scripture every day to see if what paul say be true act 17:11 the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and many others preach the gospel be not just reason but faith and the holy spirit this be not faith divorce from reason but a faith that guide informs and us reason the spirit enables u to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly god do not want u to preach the message that `` i think that jesus might have risen from the dead '' but rather `` i know that my redeemer life '' job 19:25 the christian do not side with pilate in say `` what be truth '' but rather follow christ who say `` in fact for this reason i be born and for this i come into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listens to me '' john 18:37 we can know the truth because god have promise u that we can know the truth jesus say `` if you hold to my teaching you be really my disciple then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free '' john 8:31,32 the proverb urge u `` buy the truth and do not sell it '' pr 23:23 the psalmist prayed `` do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth '' p 119:43 evidently he believe that the word of truth be in fact in his mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth be motivate by self-glorification but if we present the truth a the teaching of scripture reveal by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready to be prove wrong on the basis of scripture a luther do then we be not arrogant but humble we should humbly trust in god 's promise of truth just a we trust in his promise of forgiveness rexlex it be only because of god 's own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about a thing darren but how far do that get you once god 's revelation stop darren and your own reason begin possibility for error appear i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teaching of scripture and the product of our own reason -- even when such reason be base on scripture however i think i would draw the line of distinction more reasonably and less academically' than you would darren for example let 's suppose that our modern bible translation darren include a perfect render of jesus word at the last supper darren and that jesus say exactly `` this be my body '' darren presume that what he say be totally without error and darren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stop speak and people start darren interpret the possibility of error appear do he mean darren that literally or not we do not have any record that he darren elaborate on the word be he think of tran- or con- darren substantiation he say darren be almost at the point of make a very lutheran statement about the lord 's supper the lutheran approach be to say that if jesus say `` this be my body '' then that be what we should believe other interpretation be reject simply because they be not taught in scripture recall that jesus word do not stand alone on this subject we also have paul 's word in 1 corinthian 11:17-34 -- in which he pass on to u what he receive from the lord in particular he say `` for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lord 's death until he come '' by these word we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord 's supper really be bread a well a the lord 's body -- a our sens in fact tell u do this *prove* that tran-substantiation be false i suppose someone could say that paul spoke metaphorically of the lord 's body a bread simply because that be the way the body appear when we eat it but this thought be found nowhere in scripture so we reject it thus the primary reason for reject tran-substantiation be not that we can prove it false but that it be simply not found in scripture side remark be told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence be con-substantiation but it have be non-lutherans who have told me this we tend not to use the word i almost think that this be use more by professor of comparative religion who need label to compare catholic lutheran and reform teaching on the lord's supper but almost every church want to call their own teach '' real presence '' because that be the traditional teach of the church end side remark darren when christian speak a if they believe their own reason darren can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we darren be infallible -- the non- christian around u rarely believe darren that implicit claim witness be hardly go to work when darren the person you be talk to believe that you be either too darren foolish to recognise your own limit or intentionally try darren to cover them up this be precisely why christian should not rely on rationalization in their witness it be far well to take the approach '' like to show you what scripture say you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not '' darren rexlex suggest that people read _he be there and he be not darren silent_ by francis schaeffer i think very highly of darren it but i think that mr schaeffer be grossly overrate by many darren evangelical christian somebody else might like it though darren so let my opinion stop you from reading it darren if someone be interested in my opinion suggest _on darren certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein a long a trading reference like to suggest dr. siegbert becker 's paperback `` the foolishness of god the place of reason in lutheran theology '' publish by northwestern publishing house this book be base on becker 's doctoral thesis at the university of chicago"

b"be think about the idea that be raise by michael covington i think that word mean what we think they mean regardless of etymology be reflect on what certain word meant in my childhood and trace how this shape some of my attitude i grow up in a home where christ be a bad word people who be very angry say it the word christian meant someone who be not a jew it carry connotation of otherness of threat of enemy it take some time to figure out that there be a connection between christ and christian when i accepted jesus i expect to be disown to become a christian meant to join the enemy i knew others would consider me a traitor at some level i agree but be still prepared to pay this price like esau i sell my birthright however i make a well bargain he only get some stew but i get the incomparable rich of know christ a it turn out my parent do not disown me i found out later that they be hop it be a phase that i would grow out of by the time they have decide it a phase they be sort of use to it they disown me but they completely accept the situation either for example they come to my wedding because it be in a church when i visit my grandmother in the hospital a few day before her death she say to me `` a far a concerned you still be a jew '' what she meant be that she love me and forgave me but i be not a jew i be a christian i 'll concede one that like chicken soup with matzoh ball i do not keep kosher i do not celebrate the sabbath on saturday my son be not circumcise but these thing be true of some people who do consider themselves jew it be not these rule that make people jew it be the heritage from the past i give up the past this be why i find it hard to relate to messianic jew their experience be unlike mine they still consider themselves jew while follow jesus some would even say that i *must* do so too i be at a stage of my life now where i would like to have a heritage it be not something i value very much when i give it but i do have a sense that i be give it for god it may have be a small sacrifice it may have be an unnecessary sacrifice but i give it and do not want to ask for it back and while i have the heritage i be born with i do have another i be an outcast from the house of israel but i be a member of the church one of the thing i like about be a catholic christian be that it be rich in tradition it give me a feel of once again be root in the past this be probably one of the reason why i like it when people mess around with christian tradition for example change the name of easter these tradition fill an important emotional need of mine i suppose the point of all this be that people assume that all believer of jewish background be the same for some jewish christian be a good name for others it be an oxymoron"

b"all of the argument concern the sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or monophysite church ourght to worship on saturday if they be really sola scriptura otherwise they be follow a law put into effect by the church and only the above chruches really recognize any power of the chruch to do so andy byler you will note that nothing in the faq say anything about the church establish or change a law the argument against the sabbath be that it be part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the ceremonial law be not binding on christian this argument be base on paul 's letter act and in a more general sense jesus' teaching far most people argue that scripture show worship occur on sunday and paul endorse it i understand that these point be dispute and do not want to go around the dispute one more time the point make here be not that these argument be right but that the backing they claim be scripture accept the principle of `` sola scriptura '' do not commit u to obey the entire jewish law act 15 and paul 's letter be quite clear on that i think even the sda 's accept it the disagreement be on where the bible would have u place the line by the way protestant do give authority to the church in matter that be not dictate by god why church be free to determine their own liturgy church polity etc if you accept that the sabbath be not binding on christian then the day of worship fall into the category of item on which individual christian or since worship be by it nature a group activity church be free to decide"

b"you ask where we be i would echo that question not try to be contentious but assume that the pope have universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decision what prevents me from choose any doctrine i like and say that papal disagreement be an error that will be resolve in time this be especially true since council of bishop have basically stood by the pope the ultimate question be the traditional theology of the church this be the *only* thing that it be possible to resist a pope for his departure from the traditional doctrine of the church if command from *any* authority conflict with tradition the command must be disobeyed my own view on this be that this conflict could only happen in a major way god would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop it would be too complex for people to figure out i view the present situation in the church a anything extremely complicate run through a list of what have happen in the last 30 year in the catholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast it appear that much of what lie at the heart of this matter be disagreement over what be tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problem stem from a general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith in my opinion most catholic know about zilch about the catholic faith this leaf them wide open for destruction by err bishop basically the reformation part ii there be not even a question in my mind that in some respect the shard of the catholic church be currently be trample upon by the catholic hierarchy i could go on listing shock thing for an hour probably take the situation in campos brazil for example reading a book on what happen there after vatican council ii the bishop antonio de castro-mayer never introduce all the change that follow in the wake of vatican ii he kept the traditional mass the same old catechism etc he make sure the people knew their faith the catholic theology of obedience what modernism be etc he innoculated the people against what be come well one day the order come from rome for his retirement it come when the pope be sick bishop de castro-mayer wait until the pope recover then inquire whether this command be what the pope really want or something that some liberal have command in his absence the pope confirm the decision so the good bishop retire the injustice that follow be completely incredible a new bishop be instal he proceed to expel most of bishop de castro-mayer's clergy from their church because they refuse to celebrate the new mass the new bishop would visit a parish and celebrate a new mass the people would promptly walk out of the church en masse the bishop be *enraged* by this he usually resort to enlist the help of the secular authority to eject the priest from the church the priest would just start building new church the people be completely behind them the old parish have the new mass a the bishop desire -- and virtually no parishioner the prime motivation for all this be completely illegal accord to canon law no priest can be penalize in any way for say the traditional mass because of legislation enact by pope saint pius v. nor be there any obligation to say the new mass during all this process the people of campos not just private individual but include civil authority be constantly send petition and letter to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop nothing be ever do no help ever arrive from rome eventually 37 priest be kick out and about 40,000 people my question to the supporter of sspx be this be there any way that your position with respect to church reform could change and be conform to those of the pope assume that the pope 's position do not change and that the leader of sspx jointly make such choice if not this appear to be claim infallible teach authority if i adopt the view that `` not wrong i ca n't be wrong and there 's no way i 'll change my mind you must change yours '' that either left the catholic church or it have left me if the pope defines certain thing ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversy that process be all very well understood in catholic theology and anyone who go along with it be an instant non-catholic the problem here be that people do not appreciate what be go on in the catholic world if they knew the faith and what our bishop be do they would be shock we sould argue from now until the second come about what the `` real '' traditional teach of the church be if this be a simple matter east and west would not have be separate for over 900 year this the case in the catholic church there be a massive body of traditional teach the pope of the last 150 year be especially relevant there be no question at all what the traditional doctrine be i thought that the teach magisterieum of the church do not allow error in teaching regard faith and moral even in the short term. i may be wrong here not roman catholic heresy more or less although they have do a great job since the reformation the last 30 year have see so many error spread that pitiful infallibility rest in the pope and in the church a a whole in the short term a pope or large section of the church can go astray in fact what usually happens during a major heresy large section of the church go astray the pope historically have be much more reliable everything will always come back in the long run what would be the effect of a pope make an ex cathedra statement regard the sspx situation would it be honor if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again not try to be contention try to understand since orthodox get no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other yes it would be honor infallibility be infallibility but what be he go to define that the new mass be a well expression of the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic school be wonderful that all religion be wonderful except for that profess by the pope prior to vatican ii it do if the command be legitimate sspx do not view the pope 's command a legitimate why this be a very slippery slope"

disagree with your strong opinion 1 and the underlie presupposition i disagree that christianity be `` an infectious cult '' it have certainly show itself to be persistent a a belief system in spite of various persecution throughout the past two millenia that it continue to persevere do not demonstrate that it be '' infectious '' in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provide a workable system for it adherent and i would argue that this be the case i disagree that christianity be `` a safety blanket '' which supplants hope and purpose rather it point an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there be nothing hidden about a christian 's source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you be the distinction between internally motivate hope and purpose and externally give hope and purpose be the apparent loss of control over one 's own life the problem or be it something else finally one do not appropriate `` eternal happiness '' by follow christian moral standard indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity be *because* standard be inadequate to save people from their imperfection moral standard be merely guide to the christian the real power to moral living be give to the christian in the person of god 's spirit heaven be one of two final state that christian doctrine postulate however christian be generally not motivate to live accord to christian moral standard by this promise future reward rather they be motivate by the perceive benefit to them in the here-and-now many christian organization be concerned with evangelism a a priority and rightly so for it be jesus himself who give this a a priority for his follower however it be not the penultimate priority a evangelism be normally understood i.e preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism be generally best do through respect the opinion of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefit of a christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non-christian to seek out the christian to ask '' why '' needle to say such a demonstration be not easily accom- plished it take a radical committment to the person of jesus it do not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian be require and it can not occur where no personal bond of friendship exist it be ineffective with stranger who can not evaluate the demonstration over time and it be easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of be a `` friend '' be to gain a conversion a a long-time christian nearly 20 year i view with some skep- ticism *all* evangelism program which incorporate a `` hurry-up '' attitude pressure conversion may ultimately be bad than no conversion at all because the pressure convert realizes s/he be coerce and disavows christianity when they would have be open to it in the future have they not be take advantage of now the bible state that it be the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong-doing to people i be content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we be far more than animal we sleep eat reproduce and die just a other animal do true but we be also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself be so limited i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animal have the wide variety of perform art that human do how be it that human can learn the language of other human or animal but that other animal can not do so how be it that human can organize themselves in various social structure whereas other animal have only one structure blatant assertion christianity be not physically addictive christianity be not psychologically addictive christianity be not a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up it be a relationship with a living be you might a validly characterize any close- knit relationship with this appelation there be `` jesus freak '' who let the emotional aspect of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this do not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these thing flow guilty by association that `` christianity '' which force itself upon another be not christianity at all you appear to have an amaze certainty about what really happen 2000 year ago how do you come by it i can not accept your conclusion that jesus influence be a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in 70ad he be 30+ year go by this time it strain the bound of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life be noteworthy _until_ the sack christianity be have a relationship with jesus christ himself what do you know of him"

b"i agree that there be truth in scripture there be principle to be learn from it claim that that truth be absolute though seem to imply a literal reading of the bible if it be absolute truth constant across time culture etc then no interpretation would be necessary it may be that the lesson glean from various passage be different from person to person to me that mean that one person be right and the other be wrong i believe that god transcends our simple mind and that scripture may very well have be craft with exactly this intent god know me and know that my need be different from yours or anyone else 's by claim that scripture be absolute then at least one person in every dispute interpretation must be wrong i just believe that god be that rigid this be where the arrogance come in to play since these principle be crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of u should just take their word for it maybe it at all crystal clear to *me* that their fundamental principle be either fundamental *or* principle i think establish that figure out biblical truth be a matter of human interpretation and therefore error-prone yet you can still claim that some of them may be crystal clear maybe to a certain segment of christianity but to all not at all i think it support my position much more effectively than yours so i think that your position be the bible be absolute truth but a we be prone to error in our interpretation we can not reliably determine if we have figure out what that truth be do i get that right what 's the point of spending all this time claim and defend absolute truth when we can never know what those truth be and we can never or at least act upon them what practical difference can this make"

'' man be in a romantic mood he be bound to say all kind of silly thing like that you take them literally and that be why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that be a matter of public record the church insists on it because it be her duty among other thing to give moral advice and you can not give a man moral advice about his relation with a woman if you have no idea who be married to whom if anybody and vice versa the state insists on it since the state have a concern with property right with child care and support and therefore need to know who have make what commitment to whom prospective father-in-law insist on it because they want their daughter seduce and abandon prospective spouse insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they be hearing be a real commitment or just `` poetry '' and person make vow themselves insist on make them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own mind about what it be that they be do and may know themselves that this be not just rhetoric this be the real thing hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment the church go far and insists that when christian marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vow on behalf of the church not because it be impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teach about marriage be and that they be in fact promising to be married in a christian sense the church also prefers a standard marriage vow and be wary of let couple write their own vow for much the same reason that lawyer prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract certain language have be repeatedly use in will and one can be sure how the court will interpret it try to say the same thing in your own word and you may find that the probate judge 's interpretation of them be not at all what you intend similarly the church prefers to avoid endless debate about whether `` you be my main squeeze '' and `` i be here for the long haul '' do in fact cover the same territory a `` forsake all others '' and `` till death do u part '' this topic have come up on the list before be there any topic that one listmember be ask `` if a couple love each other and be living together that marriage in the eye of god '' eventually someone ask `` in that case what be their status if they break up be that the moral equivalent of get a divorce be they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walk of that '' in fact there be reasonable ground for suspect that someone who say `` we need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other '' be try to have it both way -- to have the advantage of marriage plus the option of change his mind with a minimum of bother at this point someone may say `` none of this applies to me and my mate we be quite clear on the fact that we have assume a lifelong commitment 'for well or bad forsake all others till death u do part so in our case no ceremony be need '' to this my reply would be the reason for require a driver's license be to keep dangerous driver off the road what be wrong in itself be not the existence of unlicensed driver but the existence of dangerous driver however test and licensing driver be an obvious and reasonable mean of pursue the goal of reduce the number of dangerous driver on the road therefore the state rightly make and enforces such law and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from drive without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you be back to the original question we have a listmember who know a couple who have be living together for around 20 year he asks at what point do they stop fornicate and start be married i answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for well or bad a long a they both live if they have accepted such an obligation what be their reason for not be willing to declare it in front of say a justice of the peace"

b"please realize that i be frequently get in trouble for stray from orthodoxy but here be my opinion i never thought of these two idea be `` against '' each other people might quibble about what `` intrinsically '' mean but the reason we be sinner be because we do not behave a good a we be the message of christ be that each of u be not only good but great that we can approach perfection albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim buddhism teach because we do not realize our greatness we sin peter have no problem walk on water until a little doubt crept in david ask in the 8th psalm `` what be man that you god should care for him but you have make him just a little low than the angel '' i probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid david be just a i probably exagerate what a gigantic monster goliath be but david 's power easily defeat goliath 's remember the rich young man who come up to jesus and asks what he can do to enter the kingdom jesus say follow the commandment i always picture the smug look on his face a he say do that his whole life probably anticipate an `` attaboy '' from the messiah instead jesus give him a harder task sell everything and follow him jesus be raise the bar the desciples say how can anyone do this if so hard even for rich people jesus say anyone can do it with god 's help jesus say not only can we avoid kill people we can avoid get angry at people not only can we avoid commit adultery we can control our own desire i realize this be not your main point but i wonder how other people see this please forgive any generalization i be about to make your point about how `` hard '' other religion be be a good one just a your `` part question '' be a tough question i think that muslim worship the same god a i do we can learn from their name `` submission '' hindu and buddhist and taoist etc claim that `` god '' be impersonal be god personal or impersonal i say yes but if i think a little more my answer be whichever be great i think it be great to be a personal entity with an individual consciousness but right that that might be a cultural bias if i think more i must admit that god 's personal nature be a far beyond my conception a his impersonal nature be beyond the hindu's conception if somehow jesus could fit into hindu cosmology then maybe i have a problem though that be hard to imagine be there any former or present `` eastern religion '' member here who could comment"

b"i differ with our moderator on this i thought the whole idea of god come down to earth to live a one of u `` subject to sin and death '' a one of the consecration prayer in the book of common prayer 1979 put it be that jesus be tempt but do not succumb if sin be not part of the basic definition of humanity then jesus `` fully human '' nicea would not be `` subject to sin '' but then the resurrection loses some of it meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin to distinguish between `` human '' and `` fall human '' make jesus less like one of u at the time we need him most first the monophysite inherit none of nestorius 's version -- they be on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second the historical record suggests that the position attribute to nestorius be not a extreme a his successful opponent who write the conventional history claimed mainly nestorius oppose the term theotokos for mary argue i think correctly that a human could not be call mother of god i mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son `` uncreate '' -- surely even arians would concede that jesus exist long before mary anyway nestorius's opponent claimed that by say mary be not theotokos that he claimed that she only give birth to the human nature of jesus which would require two seperate and distinct nature the argument fails though because mary simply give birth to jesus who preexist her either divinely if you accept `` nestorianism '' a commonly define or both nature intertwine a la chalcedon second i be not sure that `` nestorianism '' be not a well alternative than the orthodox view after all i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesus 's human nature be in heaven likewise post-ascension i think rather that god come to earth and take our nature upon him it be a seperate nature capable of be tempt a in gethsemane since i believe the divine nature could never be tempt but in it moment of weakness the divine nature prevail comment on the above warmly appreciate jason albert there may be difference in what we mean by `` subject to sin '' the original complaint be from someone who see how we could call jesus fully human because he sin i completely agree that jesus be subject to temptation i simply object to the idea that by not succumb he be thereby not fully human i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human i again apologize for confuse nestorianism and monophysitism i agree with you and have say elsewhere that there 's reason to think that not everyone who be associate with heretical position be in fact heretical there be scholar who maintain that nestorius be not nestorian i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponent i thought he get the well of them however most scholar do believe that the work that eventually lead to chalcedon be an advance and that nestorius be at the very least '' rash and dogmatic '' a the editor of `` the christological controversy '' refers to him in reject all approach other than his own a regular usenet reader know narrowness can be just a much an impediment a be wrong furthermore he do say some thing that i think be problematical he responds to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet in it he say `` to attribute also to the logo in the name of the incarnation the characteristic of the flesh that have be conjoin with him ... be my brother either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greek or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others those who be thus carry away with the idea of this association be bound because of it to make the divine logo have a part in be fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ... these thing be take falsely when they be put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for u who perpetrate the falsehood '' all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation be base on exactly the idea that the divine logo do in fact have `` to some degree '' a part in be born grow up and die of course it must be understood that there 's a certain indirectness in the logos' participation in these thing but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human or we have an incarnation at all nestorius seem to think in black and white term and miss the sort of nuance one need to deal with this area you say `` i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesus's human nature be in heaven '' i think require by orthodox doctrine the divine logo that be eternal"

b"be life a pass/fail course and do god grade on a curve new here and only vaguely religious but i want to know what some of you people think specifically be there an infinite number of heaven and a person go to the one that he/she deserves or be it simply heaven or nothing hell also be we `` grade '' by those around u or have there always be some unchanging method be the person 's childhood take into account sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you but i figure that the expert -quinn eschatology be an area on which christian do not agree i suspect because our primary source of information be prophet and visionary and their writing tend to be highly symbolic however both jesus teaching in the gospel and book such a the revelation to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death on a number of occasion jesus do say thing that imply some sort of differentiation e.g lk 10:14 and a number of similar passage where jesus say thing like `` even xxx will be well off than you in the judgement '' also i cor 3 talk about someone who get into heaven but by the skin of his teeth a it be but these passage be not normally interpret a suggest separate heaven so much a differ level of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell and not all christian would even go a far a that the only christian group i know of that believe in multiple heaven be the mormon and they be very far from mainstream christianity far enough that many of our reader would not call them christian their idea in this area involve specific mormon revelation in addition to the bible and `` holy tradition '' of a more generic christian sort note that many christian will cringe at the very thought of associate grade with god the whole point of christ be to free u from the result of a test that we possibly pas if you like test analogy god grade on a very strict and unbend scale but he also cheat -- he replaces our test paper with an exam that be prepared by the teacher before actually do the grade because some people end up in heaven and others in hell easy to see why be inclined to think of it a grade while there be difference among branch of christianity on detail i think we all agree that in one way or another god cheat i be personally very sceptical about anyone who claim to know exactly how far god 's cheat extends will he accept people who explicitly acknowledge christ but somehow still follow him in their heart many christian believe that this be possible at least in principle but certainly not all do jesus provide u with a clear description of how to be save but not clear to me that he provide an exact description of how go to place the divide line certainly he make it clear that we expect to know whether other individual be save or not"
b"one rule of thumb be that if a person be make the claim they be wrong i be just reading john 14 this morning i think that be the right chapter anyway it be close and i have a bible at work to check with and in it jesus be talk to his disciple about his impend death and he say that he will be go away and then later he will be with them he say something along the line of `` i will be in you and you will be in me '' again i can not provide the exact quote or citation anyway my understand of this be that the second come will not be an outward event it be an inward event christ will come to live in our heart and we will live in him if you look for a person you will be deceive it seem to me that the jew have be look for a messiah that would be a political or military leader and so recognize jesus when he come jesus try to show that his kingdom be not of this earth a lot of what i have see write about the second come seem to base on an expectation of christ come back and finally take over the world and run it the way it should be it sound a lot like what the jew be look for the first come like that and i see no reason for the second come to be like that either oh and by the way i expect it to happen once there be no one second come there be a lot of little one every time christ come into someone heart christ have come again peace will -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --"
b"if the papacy be infallible and this be a matter of faith then the pope can not `` be wrong '' if on the other hand this be not a matter of faith but a matter of church law then we should still obey a the pope be the legal head of the church in other word give the doctrine of infallibility we have no choice but to obey this be a primary problem in the church today what you be say be more or less heresy you might call it `` infallibilism '' the idea that the pope be always right in everything he say or do this be virtually all over the place especially in this country the pope be only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined condition when these condition be not met he can make mistake he can make *big* mistake a couple historical example come to mind bishop robert grosseteste be perhaps the great product of the english catholic church at one point during his career the reign pope decide to install one of his nephew in an english see bishop grosseteste say that this would happen over his dead body though maybe not in so many word you have to treat pope with respect even when they be wrong the problem be that this nephew would just collect the income of the see and probably never set foot there this would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd bishop grosseteste be quite right in what he do another example be that of pope john xxii a pope of the middle age he decide that soul that be save do not enjoy the beatific vision until the last judgement he decide that this should be a define doctrine of the church though he quite get around to define it now there 's no way this be compatible with catholic doctrine the pope 's doctrine be criticise by many in the church he go so far a to put a number of his opponent in jail even in the end he have to admit his mistake shortly before he die he recant his successor make the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the church if you consult any of the great catholic theologian who treat of such subject such a st. robert bellarmine a doctor of the church you will find detailed discussion of whether the pope can personally fall into heresy or schism"

b"well despite what my mother told me about accept dare here go you have to be very careful about what you mean by `` question authority '' take literally it be nonsense that which be authoratative be authoratative and to say `` i question to word of this authority '' be ridiculous if it be open to question it an authority on the other hand it be perfectly reasonable to question whether something be an authority the catch phrase here should be `` authenticate authority '' once you have authenticate your authority you must believe what it say or you be not treat it a an authority the difficulty be that authenticate an authority be not easy you can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by show logical inconsistency in what it teach or by show that it do not obey it own rule of discourse but the fact that i can not discredit something do not in inself accredit it nor do the fact that i can convince myself and other that i have discredit something necessarilly mean that it be false i can not accredit an authority by independantly verify it teaching because if i can independantly verify it teaching i need an authority i need an authority only when there be information i need which i can not get for myself thus if i be to authenticate an authority i must do it by some mean other than by examine it teaching in practical matter we accept all kind of authority because we have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves every scientist woring today assumes on the authority of the scintific community all sort of knowledge which be necessary to his work but which he have not time to verify for himself in spiritual matter we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation we select our authority base on various criterion i be a catholic in part because the historical claim of the rc church seem the strong without authority there would be no subject matter for belief unless we simply make something up for ourselves a many do the atheist position seem to be that there be no authority this be a reasonable assertion in itself but it lead to a practical difficulty if you reject all authority out of hand you reject all possibility of every receive information thus the atheist position can never possibly change it be non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific to demand scintific or rational proof of god 's existence be to deny god 's existence since neither science nor reason can in their very nature prove anything"

b"if you agree that good work have a role somewhere you will generally find yourself in one of two camp 1 faith work -- salvation or 2 faith -- salvation work either 1 work be require for salvation or 2 faith will inevitably result in good work i be also of the opinion that salvation be by faith alone base on ephesian 2 and roman 3:21-31. i also conclude that james 2 when read in context be teach bullet 2 above when james speaks of justification i would claim that he be not speak of god declare the believe sinner innocent in his sight paul 's use of the word instead he be speak of the sinner 's profession of faith be '' justified '' or `` proven '' by the display of good work also accord to james 2 the abscence of such work be evidence for a `` dead '' or '' useless '' faith which fails to save james 2 be not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it be teach 2 work would have their place not a merit toward salvation but a evidence of true faith regard -- dave weaver `` he be no fool who give what he can not keep to weaver chdasic.sps.mot.com| gain what he can not lose '' jim elliot 1949 there be of course a number of other possibility the reformer believe salvation -- faith -- work some of u suspect that the three thing be tie up together in such a way that no diagram of this form can do it justice"
b"i would like to get your opinion on this when exactly do an engage couple become `` married '' in god 's eye some say that if the two have publically announce their plan to marry have make their vow to god and be unswervingly commit to one another i realize this be a subjective qualifier they be married/joined in god 's sight the way i read scripture a couple becomes married when they be *physically* married i.e when they first have sexual intercourse e.g the end of genesis 2 quote from memory `` for this reason a man shall leave his parent and be join to his wife and they will become one flesh '' jesus also quote this scripture refer to marriage if you read through genesis in particular you will often come across the phraseology `` man lay with woman and she become his wife '' this implies that she become his wife when they lay together i.e at the point of intercourse compare this with jewish tradition joseph when he heard that mary be pregnant have it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but mary and joseph be *betrothed* not married i.e. they be in a binding relationship which require a divorce to get out of but *marriage* would not occur until mary and joseph go to bed together compare with christ and the church ephesian 5 revelation 19 the church be described a the `` bride '' of christ but the *marriage* of the lamb take place when jesus return i.e. we be in a binding love-relationship with jesus but we be still look forward to the time when the marriage will take place i see this a the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse because it represent the most intimate fellowship possible between man and god in summary engagement should be honour a a binding relationship but it be not marriage a civil ceremony be not marriage either marriage occurs at the point when the betroth couple go to bed together i mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours be great i mean to be too pedantic historically i think i be correct in state that the civil ceremony i.e a marriage recognise by the state have only be around in the west since napoleon who introduce it to keep tab on the people although ready to be correct on that point this view obviously raise some question what about those who have have sex with one or more partner without consider marriage be those people also `` married '' if it be true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse be it necessary to be married in the eye of the state i would say yes because this honour the law of our nation in the west although it be not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most western country i believe that it be god- honour to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friend before actually consummate our marriage it to do with our be salt and light and also to do with how people will perceive u i.e it be culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without go through a civil ceremony -- -- -- michael davis cs89mcd brunel.ac.uk"
b"sure why not but be you use paul to correct the word of jesus `` so *anyone* who dissolve even one of the small command and teach others the same way will be know a the low in the kingdom of the sky whereas *anyone* who keep the command and teach them too will be know a *someone* great in the kingdom of the sky '' mat5:19 gaus be you an `` anyone '' or be you a `` no one '' why not assume that since jesus say that his word apply only to jew that they apply to all human being irregardless of race or sex why not assume that even though jesus do not mention your name still jesus be talk directly to you do it say that it applies to *you* be you anyone or no one ex20:8-11 jps remember the sabbath day and keep it holy six day you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day be a sabbath of the lord your god you shall not do any work you your son or daughter your male or female slave or your cattle or the stranger who be within your settlement for in six day the lord make heaven and earth and sea and all that be in them and he rest on the seventh day therefore the lord bless the sabbath day and hollow it note there be no specific requirement for worship here however i for one would not be so bold a to call these verse a `` ceremonial detail '' many christian still practice circumcision unfortunate that jesus use your name directly or maybe jesus do be you somebody or nobody if you see a problem then perhaps there be none a paul close roman 14 gaus in short pursue the end of peace and of building each other up let dietary consideration undo the work of god everything may be clean but evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit well not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother be offend by a for the faith that you have keep that between yourself and god the person be in luck who condemn himself for what he sample on the other hand the person with doubt about something who eats it anyway be guilty because he act on his faith and any failure to act on faith be a sin"

b"here again the problem with most of the individual post here you take the biblical account a though it be some sort of historical recount in the modern sense i would refer you to john dominic crossans book _the cross that spoke_ pub harper and row 1988 the early text which we have make no reference to an empty tomb nor be an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection modern evangelicals/fundamentalists have completely miss what the point of resurrection be -- here the work of george nickelsburg 's work _resurrection immortality and eternal life in intertestamental judaism_ publ cambridge havard univ press 1972 be most helpful look at rom 1:1-3. paul here have no need of an empty tomb additionally in 1 cor 15 here again there be no mention of an empty tomb he be raise note the passive he appear no ascension either resurrection could be accomplish without ever disturb the bone in the grave the whole idea of an empty tomb broach in any of our text until well after the fall of jerusalem by that time the idea of come up with a body would have be ludicrious moreover mack have argue convicingly i think that the empty tomb story first appear in mark we have no text before this which mention the tomb you be quite right here even the idea of a subjective mystical event a the foundation of the resurrection narrative be currently become more untenable see b. mack _a myth of innocence_"
b"you ask where we be i would echo that question not try to be contentious but assume that the pope have universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decision what prevents me from choose any doctrine i like and say that papal disagreement be an error that will be resolve in time this be especially true since council of bishop have basically stood by the pope it appear that much of what lie at the heart of this matter be disagreement over what be tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline my question to the supporter of sspx be this be there any way that your position with respect to church reform could change and be conform to those of the pope assume that the pope 's position do not change and that the leader of sspx jointly make such choice if not this appear to be claim infallible teach authority if i adopt the view that `` not wrong i ca n't be wrong and there 's no way i 'll change my mind you must change yours '' that either left the catholic church or it have left me the orthodox church do not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction view authority a present in each bishop and in ecumenical council we regard the subsequent development of the doctrine regard papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the bishop of rome from the orthodox church without go into the merit of the great schism at least the orthodox agree that a split occur and paly what appear to be semantic game like `` the pope but we recognize that what he do be effective ... '' word aside it appear to be a de facto split we sould argue from now until the second come about what the `` real '' traditional teach of the church be if this be a simple matter east and west would not have be separate for over 900 year i thought that the teach magisterieum of the church do not allow error in teaching regard faith and moral even in the short term. i may be wrong here not roman catholic what would be the effect of a pope make an ex cathedra statement regard the sspx situation would it be honor if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again not try to be contention try to understand since orthodox get no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other it do if the command be legitimate sspx do not view the pope 's command a legitimate why this be a very slippery slope true enough one could argue that they be establish a non-geographic jurisdiction i know if even a concept or problem in catholic circle larry overacker llo shell.com --"

b"the problem you see here be that some christian claim thing about the bible which they actually believe or practice know all sort of christian range from the trendiest of liberal to the fire-breathing fundamentalist and although many on the conservative side of the christian faith do claim that the bible be a perhaps *the* source of absolute truth i know of anyone who treat it a anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition while i be not a roman catholic i believe this be close to the official position of the rc church perhaps an rc would like to comment the particular practice you refer to will usually be explain in term of the social context of the time you would think the fact that the conservative seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this other passage a well directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the bible and what they actually practice be two different thing but mostly it doens't while this thread be suppose to be about the arrogance of christian i would suggest that some of the problem be really hypocrasy in this case make claim about the bible which the claimant actually put into practice but if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people be attempt to say we see that they be try to express very concisely the unique place the bible hold within the christian faith so when people use such word or phrase a `` word of god '' `` inerrant '' `` infallibale '' `` the manufacturer 's handbook '' `` the only rule of faith and practice in the church today '' to describe the bible we should try to hear what they be say and not just look at the mere word they use some of the above description be demostratably false and others be self-contradictory but in my experience people be generally pretty good at pick out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker 's word be at variance with their intention a biblical example be from the garden of eden where god asks `` where be you '' and adam explains that he be naked and afraid and hid himself if adam have answer god 's word he would have say something like `` here in this tree '' the problem seem to arise when christian insist that these word be indeed accurate reflection of their beleif most people have not make a determine effort to work out their own understand of the place of the bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrase and explanation that others use i hope this help -- ___ bill rea o o -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -w -- u -- w --"
b"on palm sunday at our parish we be `` invite '' to take the role of jesus in the passion i decline to participate last year at the liturgy meeting i point out how we crucify christ by our sin so therefore it be appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but to no avail a a member of a liturgy committee i can tell you that the problem be certain people dominate who want to try out all kind of innovation the priest seem even to _want_ to make any decision of their own in many case i guess easy to `` try something new '' than it be to refuse to allow it at our parish on holy thursday instead of the priest wash foot `` who want to get around people 's foot '' accord to one of our priest the congregation be `` invite '' to come up and help wash one another 's hand the symbolism of this action distressed me and again i refuse to participate i thought that if we be to have to come up with rubric for this liturgical action i.e `` body of christ '' -- `` amen '' for receive communion that they could be `` i be not responsible for the blood of this man '' also for part of the eucharistic prayer `` bless be you god of all creation ... '' be substitute some text read by a lay couple the priest certainly should not have give this part of the mass over to others and i be so disturbed that i decline to receive communion that night we require to anyway -- i instead offer up prayer for our priest and parish the quality of the mass have not change again if it be to be celebrate accord to the rubric set down by the church it would still be `` liturgically '' beautiful the problem come about from people try to be `` creative '' who be not i think the answer to your question on participation could be that give by father peter stravinskas in answer to the question pose by the title of thomas day 's _why catholic sing_ `` they want to '' because of all this nonsense by the way for any non-catholic reading this the problem do not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church but by those who be disobedient to the church in change it on their own `` authority ''"

b"more correctly when people die they cease to exist the idea gotten be that to christian hell be -- like heaven -- afterlife i.e you cease to exist but be subject to eternal torture well the orthodox idea anyway `` eternal death '' if you prefer that atheist believe in any sort of afterlife i think safe to say that hell be never intend metaphorical certainly not the equivalent of cease to exist some christian concept be indeed metaphor but your idea of hell be a 20th century interpretation it be of course nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview of modern age but i fear the church will not accept it understandably per- hap because if you accept that hell be a metaphor then one step closer to turn god into a metaphor a well"
b"hello src reader again the misconception that copt among other oriental orthodox church believe in monophysitism pop up again we have a discussion about it a while ago then ofm comment with my appreciation to the moderator i believe that far elaboration be need this be an excerpt from an article feature in the first issue of the copt-net newsletter under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople a oppose to the western empire of rome the patriarch and pope of alexandria played lead role in christian theology they be invite everywhere to speak about the christian faith st. cyril pope of alexandria be the head of the ecumenical council which be held in ephesus in the year 430 a.d. it be say that the bishop of the church of alexandria do nothing but spend all their time in meeting this lead role however do not fare well when politics start to intermingle with church affair it all start when the emperor marcianus interfere with matter of faith in the church the response of st. dioscorus the pope of alexandria who be later exile to this interference be clear `` you have nothing to do with the church '' these political motif become even more apparent in chalcedon in 451 when the coptic church be unfairly accuse of follow the teaching of eutyches who believe in monophysitism this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ have only one nature the divine not two nature the human a well a the divine the coptic church have never believe in monophysitism the way it be portrayed in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysitism meant believe in one nature copt believe that the lord be perfect in his divinity and he be perfect in his humanity but his divinity and his humanity be united in one nature call `` the nature of the incarnate word '' which be reiterate by st. cyril of alexandria copt thus believe in two nature `` human '' and `` divine '' that be united in one `` without mingle without confusion and without alteration '' from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy these two nature `` do not separate for a moment or the twinkle of an eye '' also from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy the coptic church be misunderstood in the 5th century at the council of chalcedon perhaps the council understood the church correctly but they want to exile the church to isolate it and to abolish the egyptian independent pope despite all of this the coptic church have remain very strict and steadfast in it faith whether it be a conspiracy from the western church to exile the coptic church a a punishment for it refusal to be politically influence or whether pope dioscurus quite go the extra mile to make the point that copt be not monophysite the coptic church have always felt a mandate to reconcile `` semantic '' difference between all christian church this be aptly express by the current 117th successor of st. mark pope shenouda iii `` to the coptic church faith be more important than anything and others must know that semantics and terminology be of little importance to u '' throughout this century the coptic church have played an important role in the ecumenical movement the coptic church be one of the founder of the world council of church it have remain a member of that council since 1948 a.d. the coptic church be a member of the all african council of church aacc and the middle east council of church mecc the church play an important role in the christian movement by conduct dialogue aim at resolve the theological difference with the catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and evangelical church ... a a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox do sign a common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism be condemn so the coptic orthodox church do not believe in monophysitism peace nabil -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

chalcedon be a compromise between two group the alexandrian and antiochenes it adopt language that be intend to be acceptable to moderate in both camp while ruling out the extreme i agree that there be extreme that be heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appear that some people get reject who intend heresy but simply use language that be not understood or even be mispresented and some seem not to have joint in the compromise for reason other than doctrine there be group descend from both of the supposedly heretical camp this post discuss the descendant of the alexandrian there be also a remain nestorian like some of the current so-called monophysite there be reason to believe that the current so-called nestorian be not heretical either they shelter nestorius from what they saw a unfair treatment but claim they do not adopt his heresy and in fact seem to follow more moderate representative of the antiochene tradition"

b'respond to the moderator yes i agree what try to point out be that in matter of faith i.e tenet which be not logically persuasive one may be convince of the truth of certain thing through for instance personal revelation and it certainly fine to share that revelation or those belief with others and i think that it arrogant persay to accepts matter of pure faith a truth for oneself where i think the conflict arises be in assume that where disagreement on belief arise all others *must* have be give the same truth and that god must reveal his truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree i think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you be be sinful or dishonest that they be reject something they *know* to be truth because it be inconvenient for them or because they wish to spurn god i would say that this be equivalent to assume that *all* truth one hold be universal and absolute and the problem i see with this be that it negates the individuality of human and their relationship with god this do not mean there be no absolute truth just that some area of doctrinal disagreement may be area where god have not establish or reveal that truth -- comment criticism welcome ... -ken alvin ucsu.colorado.edu'

b"can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when question the truth of his scripture or will he assume the superstition of his parent when question often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wonder about god and his scripture see it in the christian the jew the muslim and the other theist alike all assume that their mother and father be right in the aspect that a god exists and with that belief search for their god occasionally the theist may switch religion or aspect of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some `` creator '' be behind the universe 's existence know muslim who be once christian and vice versa know christian who be once jewish and vice versa and even know christian who become hindu yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they 've kept this belief in some form of high `` be '' why it usually all have to do with how the child be brought up from the time he be born the theist be brought up with the notion of the `` truth '' of some kind of scripture -- the bible the torah the qur'an etc he be told of this wondrous god who write or inspire the scripture of the prophet talk about in the scripture of the miracle perform etc he be also told that to question this a child be apt to do be a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip- ture 's truth be to damn one 's soul to hell thus by the time he be able to read the scripture for himself the belief in it `` truth '' be so ingrain in his mind it all seem a matter of course but it stop there once the child be able to read for himself there be an endeavor to inculcate the child the `` right '' reading of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant reading to gloss over the bad one and to explain away the unexplainable with `` mystery '' circular argument `` self-evdent '' fact and `` truth '' unreasoning belief and fear of hell be the meat of religion the child must eat of every day to doubt of course mean wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concern god all of this have some considerable effect on the child so that when he becomes an adult the superstition be taught be nearly impossible to remove all of this lead me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when question god hell heaven the angel soul and all of the rest can he for a moment put aside this notion that god *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view obviously most theist can somewhat especially when present with `` mythical god '' homeric roman egyptian etc. but can they put aside the assumption of god 's existence and question it impartially stephen _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ atheist _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ libertarian _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ pro-individuality _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ pro-responsibility _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ jr. and all that jazz ... --"

b"a few point about mary 's be take into heaven at the end of her life on earth one piece of evidence for mary 's assumption into heaven be the fact that no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she be bury some christian church claimed to be locate at the final rest place of peter mark and other saint but no one ever claimed to posse the body of mary the great of the saint why because everyone knew that she have be take up into heaven although there be no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of mary some passage seem suggestive like the passage in revelation that describes a woman give birth to a son and later be crown in the heaven of course the woman in this passage have other interpretation she can also be take a symbol for the church the assumption of mary make sense because of her relationship to christ jesus perfect god and perfect man fulfil the requirement of the law perfectly under the law god give to u we be to honor our mother and father and christ 's act of take his mother into heaven be part of his fulfillment of that law also he take his flesh from her so it seem appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave one last point an ex-catholic attempt to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by assert it be connect to a belief that mary do not die this be not a correct summary of what catholic believe the dogma of the assumption be carefully phrase to avoid say whether mary do or do not die in fact the consensus among catholic theologian seem to be that mary in fact do die this would make sense christ die and his mother who wait at the foot of the cross would want to share in his death"

b"desiree bradley desiree_bradley mindlink.bc.ca ask u whether we should think of the serb a do god 's work in bosnia refrain from post in hope that someone who be more familiar with the ot than i would answer but at this point i feel i have to say something many thing about this post bother me i know of not the slightest suggestion in the nt that christian should use force to propagate the gospel and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of moslem violates the heart of the gospel christ die to break down these distinction in him there be neither jew nor greek there be neither slave nor free there be neither male nor female if moslem do not know him we may preach to them but we kill them furthermore the attack be between state not religion there be christian be attack a well one of the town under attack be one of the few place where christian and moslem be living together peacefully the precedent be suggest be from the ot there be in fact two different thing be allude to the first be from the entry into canaan for that to be a parallel we would need for god to have promise this land through a prophet and we would need the war to be a holy war there be tight constraint on behavior in those attack any violation be likely to cause the israelite to be defeat rape would not have be tolerate while the account in joshua emphasize town that be totally destroyed note that it be possible for a town to make peace with the israelite and that once that be do -- even when deception be involve -- they be expect to honor it in contrast there have be many violation of agreement in this incident i see no evidence that god have grant bosnia to the serb a a promise land and if he have their behavior would have disqualify this from be a holy war the other ot parallel be from later when israel be defeat by assyria and babylonia the prophet saw this a a judgement on israel for her sin someone asks whether we see this a a judgement on the bosnians for their sin this sound like a replay of the old claim that we have doctor or hospital because illness be god 's judgement yes even bad thing may be use by god for good that include action of bad people but that justify them if you read the prophet you find them very clear that in attack israel the assyrian and babylonian be act a *unintentional* agent of god their intent be to attack god's people and they would be judged for it the fact that they be actually carry out god 's plan excuse their action furthermore we conclude from this that all attack be judgement from god god explicitly interpret that case through his prophet a far a i know he do not send any prophet to bosnia while i find it hard to see any good in the current fight i be sure god will eventually make good come out of bad but that justify it and it save the people who be do it from judgement"
b'the two historic fact that i think the most important be these 1 if jesus rise from the dead then he must have do something else equally impressive in order to create the observe amount of impact 2 nobody ever displayed the dead body of jesus even though both the jewish and the roman authority would have gain a lot by do so it would have discredit the christian'
b'dean and i write lot and lot about absolute truth and arrogance i agree that probably never agree and start to feel frustrate and tire of have my conversation with my husband dominate by this topic just kid i do have to say though that participate in this discussion have be a good learn experience for me my view on this topic have evolve and clarify through this and i suspect that we may not disagree a much a we think i admit that strongly prejudice against evangelical christianity and i may not always be rational in my reaction to it i grow up in ec and go to an ec college it be definitely the wrong place for me and i react strongly to any implication that ec or conservative christianity have any sort of stronghold on true christianity i shudder when i remember the condescend attitude i have about other christian who adhere to the ec model i have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of absolute truth be the action i have see it lead to i have have some very bad experience with evangelical christian claim to know the truth and judging me or others base on their belief that they have the answer know the truth seem to leave a whole lot of room for others opinion i can accept your belief in absolute truth a long a you* try to use that belief to try to force others to comply with it and you be very careful that you hurt others with it love your neighbor seem to go totally out the window when one know the truth and believe that everyone should be living by that truth other people have conviction about the truth every bit a strong and sincere a yours base on careful search prayer and their relationship with god dismiss them because god lead them to the same conclusion a yours *this be not direct personally at you dean'

b"and the two simplest refutation be these 1 what impact the only record of impact come from the new testament i have no guarantee that it book be in the least accurate and that the record `` impact '' actually happen i find it interest that no other contemporary source record an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain be torn etc the early write claim we have of jesus resurrection be from the pauline epistle none of which be write sooner than 20 year after the suppose event 2 it seem probable that no one displayed the body of jesus because no one knew where it be i personally believe that the most likely explanation be that the body be steal by disciple or by graverobber bother with the point about the guard ... it only appear in one gospel and seem like exactly the sort of thing early christian might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge the new testament do record that jew believe the body have be steal if there be really guard they could not have effectively make this claim a they do"
b"on of the attribute of be sacred in this case be that they should not be spoken of in a `` common manner '' or `` trample under foot '' such a the lord name be today the ceremony be perform in the temple because the temple have be set aside a be a sacred/holy/uncommon place we believe that the ceremony can only be interpret correctly when they be view with the right spirit- which in this case be in the temple so from our point of view when they be brought out into the public they be be trample under foot because of misinterpretation and mock and it be therefore offensive to u please do not assume that because of my use of the word 'we and 'our that an official spokesman for the lds church i be merely state what i believe be the general feel among u others feel free to disagree"
b"i be told that plan parenthood/siecus-style `` values-free '' method that teach contraceptive technology and advise kid how to make `` choice '' actually _increase_ pregnancy rate i post a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who be interested the article include source to contact for information on research verify these statement and an outstanding source for info on acquire abstinence-related curriculum even in single-copy quantity for home use the same research produce the result that abstinence-related curriculum be found to _decrease_ pregnancy rate in teen i assume that it be reasonable to assume that the aid rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate the difference be not in `` contraceptive technology '' but in the value taught to the child the pp/siecus curriculum taught the kid that they have legitimate choice while the abstinence related curriculum taught them that they do _not_ have _legitimate_ choice other than abstinence it be the value system that be the strong determinent of the behavior behavior of these kid despite the well track record of abstinence-related curriculum they be suppress in favor of curriculum that produce an effect contrary to that desire question for far discussion a they say in the textbook why we teach `` safe drug use '' to kid instead of drug abstinence it because we know that a class in `` how to use drug safely if you _choose_ to use drug '' would increase drug use why `` drug abstinence education '' bar from school because it teach `` religion '' we abandon those child who will use drug anyway and need instruction in their safe use"
b'one of the thing i find intersting about pagan belief be their belief in a feminine deity a well a a masculine deity be brought up in a christian household i often wonder if there be god the father where be the mother everyone i know who have a father usually a a mother it just seem rather unbalanced to me fortunately my own personal theology which will probably not fall into line with a lot others recognize god a a be both without gender and pose quality of both gender a be both a masculine and feminine force it provide a sense of balance i find sorely lack in most theology a lack which i think be responsible for a lot of the unbalanced way in which we see the world and treat each other'

b"on the one hand there be advantage to have the liturgy stay the same john have described some of these on the other hand some people seem to start tune out the same old word and pay attention well when thing get change around i think innovative priest and liturgy committee be try to get our attention and make thing more meaningful for u it drive me crazy too different people have differ preference and need in liturgy my local parish be innovative i prefer to go to mass at the next parish over sometimes we have the option of attend a mass in the style which best suit u john put a smiley on it but to `` just offer it up '' probably be the solution a related issue that it sound like john do not have to deal with be that spouse may have different liturgical taste my husband do like innovative litury it be a challenge to meet both of our spiritual need without just go our separate way when you include the factor of also try to satisfy our child 's need thing get pretty complicate one thing to remember be that even the most uncongenial mass be still mass"
b"someone sent me this faq by e-mail and i post my response here not enforce the inclusion limit on this faq because most of our reader probably see it -- clh christ warns that anyone who `` break one of the least of these commandment *and* teach otheres to do the same will be call least in the kingdom of heaven '' matt 5:19. this faq be so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology 1. the law be know to man before it be reveal on mount sinai rom 4:15 note that `` where no law be there be no transgression '' not only do sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath be kept before it be reveal on sinai ex 16 2. the problem with the first covenant be not the law but the promise which undergirded it god want to perform his will in the life of the people but in their ignorance after 400 year of slavery they promise '' what ever he say to do we will do '' that be why the new covenant be base on `` well promise '' heb 8:6 rather than do away with the law god promise to `` put my law in their mind and write them on their heart '' heb 8:10 3. include the sabbath in the act 15 be selective inclusion the sabbath be more important to the jew than circumcision if any attempt have be make to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have be even more strident than be record in act 15. do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbath which could occur at any time of the week and be part of the law ceremonial which be *added* because of transgression of the moral law gal 3:19 4. israel stand for god 's people of all time that be why god *grafted* the gentile in rom 9:4 say that the adoption the glory the covenant the give of the law the service of god and the promise belong to israelite in explanation paul make it clear that be born into israel be not enough `` for they be not all israel which be of israel '' v 6. then in gal 3:19 he say `` if ye be christ 's then be ye abraham 's seed and heir accord to the promise '' all christian be abraham 's seed jew israelite not physically for that be not the criterion but spiritually we be joint heir with jesus base on the promise god make to all his people the israelite people would probably agree but they be wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it be part of a law which predates the ceremonial law you be not free to choose your time of worship even if you be why do you follow a day of worship which have it origin in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god bless sanctify and hallow in exchange for one which all church leader agree have not biblical foundation see sabbath admission in soc.religion.christian.bible-study i do not care what calvin or any theologian say my guide be what god say if be not under the law mean we do not have to keep the law why be it that the only section of the law we have trouble with be the sabbath commandment which be the only one god thought be important enough to say *remember* if you study the word deeply you will note that the message be that we be no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pull me over for speed then in court i ask for mercy and the judge do not throw the book at me but give me grace do i walk out of the court say `` i can now go on speed for i be now under grace '' be under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul add to it in rom 3:31 `` di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law '' `` wherefore the law be holy and the commandment holy and just and good '' rom 7:12 do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the act 20 show that the meeting be on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul do not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to assos in icor 16 there be no way you can equate `` lay by him in store '' with `` go to a worship service '' wrong these be the sabbath day of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law why would you prefer to twist and turn rely on different argument which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a god who love you enough to die for you jesus die because the law could not be change why bother to die in order to meet the demand of a broken law if all you need to do be change the law penalty for law break mean the law be immutable that be why it be no sin not to follow the demand of the ceremonial law it will always be a sin to make false god to violate god 's name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then your opinion have no weight when place next to the word of god darius not clear how much more need to be say other than the faq i think paul 's comment on esteem one day over another rom 14 be probably all that need to be say i accept that darius be do what he do in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who `` esteem all day alike '' be similarly do their best to honor the lord however like to be clear that i do not think there 's unambiguous proof that regular christian worship be on the first day a i indicate there be response on both of the passage cite the difficulty with both of these passage be that they be actually about something else they both look like they be talk about nnregular christian meeting but neither explicitly say `` and they gather every sunday for worship '' we get various piece of information but nothing aim at answer this question act 2:26 describes christian a participate both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion service in home obviously the temple worship be on the sabbath act 13:44 be an example of christian participate in them unfortunately it tell u what day christian met in their house act 20:7 despite darius' confusion be described by act a occur on sunday i see no reason to impose modern definition of when day start when the biblical text be clear about what be meant the word implies to me that this be a normal meeting it say they gather to see paul off but that when they be gather for break bread paul talk about his upcoming travel but just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with 1 cor 16:2. it say that on the first day they should set aside money for paul's collection now if you want to believe that they gather specially to do this or that they do it in their home i disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they be expect to do it in their home there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obvious reading of this be that `` on the first day of every week '' simply mean every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implication and not clear statement be that the nt author assume that their reader knew when christian worship be"

b"this be be post a a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine the doctrine of god i. the person of the godhead of all of the doctrine of scripture this be the most important the bible be pre-eminently a revelation of god therefore our first objective in study the bible should be to know god i believe that the bible teach that there be three person in the godhead trinity god the father god the son -- the lord jesus christ and god the holy spirit i believe that they be individual person who be one in nature meaning that they be identical in nature each possess the same divine attribute they be also equally worthy of our worship our trust and our obedience cf matt.28:19 2 cor.13:14 john 14:8,9,16,17. ii the attribute or characteristic of the godhead a. god 's nature be reveal in the name he have take for himself jehovah he be the living god eternal and unchanging he be without begin and without end cf isa.42:8. b. god be a spirit cf john 4:24. c. god be love cf 1 john 4:8,16. a such he be gracious merciful good faithful patient and full of lovingkindness cf psa 89:1,2 psa 103:8 nahum 1:7. d. but god be also holy and righteous he be absolutely without sin in his nature and so be incapable of sin in though word or action cf ex 15:11 isa 6:3. e. god be omnipresent everywhere present at the same time in the completeness of his person omniscient all know know all thing -- the end from the begin infinitely wise omnipotent almighty sovereign with unlimited power over all creation god be infinite in his presence wisdom and power it be my conviction that the work of the lord in our day have become very man-centered and that the people in our church know very little about god i believe that the lord 's work need to be god-centered and that the people of god need to understand that god be sovereign in all thing in the affair of nation in the life of all people and in the carry out of his purpose regard salvation iii the work of the godhead a. in creation all three person of the godhead be active in create and all three be active in sustain creation and in order the course of human affair for nation a well a individual people to the end of time cf gen. 1:1,2 john 1:1-3 col. 1:16-17 heb 1:3. b. in salvation in order to understand salvation i believe that it be absolutely necessary to begin with god not with man all three person of the godhead have be and be active in salvation 1. god the father salvation originate with god the member of the godhead determine in eternity past that there would be salvation the condition under which people could and would be save and even who would be save election to salvation be recognize in scripture a the work of god the father cf eph 1:3-4 2 thess 2:13-14 2. christ the son of god the lord jesus christ through his birth by the virgin mary come to the earth to accomplish two important work a. he come a the final and complete revelation of god the father cf col 1:15 heb 1:1-3. b. he come to provide salvation for all whom the father have chosen he do this by his death on the cross by his bodily resurrection and by his present intercessory work in heaven the work of salvation will be complete for u when the lord return cf rom 5:8-10 1 cor 15:3- 4 heb 7:25 1 john 3:2 3. the holy spirit a the author of scripture the theme of which be christ and his redemptive work the holy spirit be carry out the redemptive plan of god in the follow way a. he convict of sin cf john 16:7-11 b. he regenerates know in the bible a the new birth cf john 3:5-8. c. he indwells each believer to fulfill the work of sanctification cf john 14-16-17. d. he seal every believer in christ thus make salvation secure cf eph 1:13-14. e. he baptizes every believer into the body of christ cf cor 12:13 f. he teach every believer the truth of scripture cf john 14:26. g. he bestows spiritual gift on the people of god for ministry cf 1 cor 12 h. he restrains sin cf gal 5:16-26. i. he empowers for living and for service cf act 1:8"

b"yes i do agree with your definition my use of the term `` always '' be rather deceptive i admit hold it i say that all of scripture be true however discern exactly what jesus paul and company be try to say be not always so easy i believe that paul be try to say that all woman should behave that way rather he be try to say that under the circumstance at the time the woman he be speak to would best avoid volubility and cover their head this have to do with maintain a proper witness toward others remember that any number of relativistic statement can be derive from absolute for instance it be absolutely right for christian to strive for peace however this do not rule out try to maintain world peace by resort to violence on occasion yes my opinion sure the bible preaches absolute truth however exactly what those truth be be sometimes a matter of confusion a i say the bible do preach absolute truth sometimes those fundamental principle be crystal clear at least to evangelicals sometimes they be not so clear to everyone e.g should baptism be by full immersion or not etc that be largely because sometimes it be not explicitly spell out whether the writer be speak to a particular culture or to christianity a a whole this be where scholarship and the study of biblical context come in god reveal his truth to the world through his word it be utterly unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate interpretation practically anything can be misinterpret especially when it come to matter of right and wrong care to deny that"

b"heard it say that the account we have of christ life and ministry in the gospel be actually write many year after the event about 40 year or so be this correct if so why the big time delay i know all scripture be inspire of god so the time of write be i suppose un-important but i still help be curious -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ivan thomas barr contact me at u9126619 athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk the gospel date so we can only guess luke 's prolog be about the only thing we have from the author describe his process the prolog sound like luke be from the next generation and have to do some investigate there be tradition pass down verbally that say a few thing about the composition of the gospel there be debate about how reliable these tradition be they certainly have the status of scripture yet scholar tend to take some of them seriously one suggests that mark be base on peter 's sermon and be write to preserve them when peter have die or way about to die one tradition about matthew suggests that a collection of jesus word may have be make earlier than the current gospel in the ancient world it be much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information i think many people would have prefer to hear about jesus directly from someone who have know him and maybe even from someone who study directly under such a person rather than from a book thus i suspect that the gospel be largely from a period when these people be begin to die scholar generally do think there be some write material earlier which be probably use a source for the exist gospel establish the date be a complex and technical business i have to confess that not sure how much reliance put on the method use but common to think that mark be write first around 64 ad. and that all of the gospel be write by the end of the century a few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other"

b"between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occur this involve a gradual dim of consciousness of the spiritual world this be discernable in the world outlook of different people through history the greek for example could say `` well a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead '' iliad i think the question of what happens to human being who die before christ be an ever present one with christian i be not ready to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation yet they all die in their sin in the christian sense the same can be say of the whole of gentile humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him i do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of it fulfillment it be possible to experience eternity in a passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration be not simply one of indefinitely extend condition of greenwich mean time it be possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss or even many of them in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth it be also a standard belief among many people that even the righteous be lose this again be the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that flee from u after the fall with our ever increase involvement with the sense world it would be interest to share in the result of your study of ancient people 's idea of life after death mankind fell into mist and darkness and at `` the turn point of time '' a new light enter into the world the light still grows and we be develop the eye with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under- stand lie before u our new vision and understand be still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which be old and much more a well at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insight that have lead me to my view on this subject the way you refer to it a `` doctrine '' put a modern intellectual color on it i think it be much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teach that struck much closer to home than our doctrine or teaching today can be receive i be not so ready to attribute widespread notion in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they be pass on the question be to what extent do they reflect real perception and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people 's idea of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlie reality in any case we study geometry not by reading old manuscript of euclid but by contemplate the principle themselves on the other hand there be one notion firmly embed in christianity that originate most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human be consists essentially of soul only and that the soul be create at birth be consciously adopt from aristotle whose idea dominate christian thought for fifteen hundred year and still do today he be at once the father of modern thought and at the same time live during that darken time when the perception of our eternal spiritual be have grown dim indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation be a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment i.e after the end of a single earthly life be not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that be why the early creed be couched in term that do not try to spell it out"

b"andrew how i wish this be true and how i long for the day in which it will be true but ala it be not true of history the bible do not have a message -- it have message and some of those be message of repentance and give to turn the other cheek and do unto the least of these but some of the message be the complete opposite like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribe include woman and child down to cattle and punish severely when they be less than complete about the job like jew who be say to have cry out in matthew `` his blood be upon our head and our childrens head '' a verse quote in every pogrom from the crusade to the holocaust have these be misunderstood i think not they have only be understood too clearly it be essential that christian grasp firmly the good the bible teach the meek carpenter from nazareth be a potent symbol for how we should be his teaching we must take to heart but we can not ignore the other material in the bible which be not to our like and say those who live by that have misread it to say that be only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative such can be do with the same legitmacy by anyone instead we must let the text critique the text understand that there be both good and bad in our sacred corpus we test all thing and hold fast to that which be good at the risk of sound heretical well ok more heretical i think that doubt be something which require forgiveness it be something which require introspection and reflection if that be a sin then there can be no salvation for doubt be an inescapble part of be human consider job his friend have no doubt whereas job have no doubt in himself but doubt the wisdom and justice of god when god finally do appear he rebuke the friend and have job make sacrifice for them to be a christian it to always have doubt or not to have honesty"
b"i claim to be an expert on the branch davidians but i might know more than most the branch davidian group lead by koresh be actually one of two off-shoots of a group know a the shephard 's rod the shephard 's rod now defunct a far a i know broke off from the sda church in the 30 's the shephard 's rod broke away from the sda church because they felt that the sda church be become weak and fall into apostacy they felt that they be the remnant spoken about in revelation about the koresh group koresh gain control of it in 1987 or 1988. once in control he make himself the center of it he proclaim himself a christ koresh himself come from an sda background he be excommunicate a a young adult by the local congregation for try to exert too much control over the youth in the church after this he join the branch davidians they were/are a survivalist cult this be why they have the stockpile of weapon food a bomb shelter etc they have no intent of raid the u government or anything they be prepare for armaggedon and be put themselves in a self defense position in my opinion if the atf and the fbi have left well enough alone we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ child cry out from the ash in waco if you want to know about the shephard 's rod you might want to visit the local sda church and talk to some of the old people they could give you some insight into where koresh get his theology"
b"deletia- sig deletia- formality i probably should let this pas not worth the time and not really intend for me but i resist a personal weakness of mine jerkius kneeus tragically incurable not so i can prove that the existance of god be disputable by show that people dispute it this be easy i dispute that god exists simple i miss your `` traditional proof '' treatise but the proof i remember from the summa theologic the 5 way i think it be be rather poor stuff the ontological argument be about a billion time well imho i would think want non-traditional proof consider the general failure of the traditional proof at least the one i know of i be think of the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the teleological argument those be the one traditional enough to have funny name anyway this be the real question so to discus it i 'll assume god exists otherwise there be no heavenly authority to babble about please show this be the case i be familiar with the first cause argument and i 'll accept for the sake of argument that there be a first cause even though i find some of it premices questionable the rest have to show this include that the first cause be god get it i deny that god be all good so there this self-consistent if human must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not do it well unless you think god be human grant god make himself 'human but this be nonetheless cheat the intent of the statement be clearly that man have to fix the problem he cause god fix it- even by indirect means- contradicts this why also why assume say claim be true anyway if *i* claim to be truth be you bound by reason to follow me undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the command of the marine without question you seem to imply this about god and that the marine be similar in this respect.. if this be not what you be try to say they please explain what it be you be say a i have miss it why why not question it even if it *is* truth we can not know this certainly so why be it so irrational to question perhaps we will thus discover that we be wrong you assert that god be truth and we question truth but i assert that god be not truth and anyway we can question truth how be it my assertion be less good than yours oh i hereby deny 1+1=2 i hope agree 1+1=2 be the truth grant i look pretty damn silly say something like that but i need something both agree be clearly true now notice no stormtroopers have march in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven light bolt either no mysterious net outage i seem to be permit to say such thing absurd or not they be certainly not true at least the one newton derive be not true and be indeed wildly inaccurate at high speed or small distance we do not have a set of law of physic that always work in all case if we do physic would be over already science be all about question this sort of truth if we still follow aristotle generalize this a little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the thing you know tm because you can always be wrong even presuppose that truth may not be deny and may not be question and that god be truth it only follow that god may not be deny or question not that he must be obeyed we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoy of u but you have not connect denial with disobedience -- dan `` no nickname '' johnson and god say `` jeeze this be dull '' ... and it *was* dull genesis 0:0"
b"note i be not the original poster i be just answer because i think this be important evil result of human sinfulness rather than the will of god whoo go to have to be very careful with my language here i think god be voluntarily give up his omniscience in this world so that we can decide on our own where we go -- free will in this sense god allows evil to occur and in this sense can be `` held responsible '' a my chaplain say however his will be of course that all be save not go to save u `` by himself '' -- we have to take a step in his direction before he will save u read that last sentence carefully -- not say we save ourselves say we have to accept our salvation i do not believe in predestination -- it would appear from what you say far down that you do stuff delete ok -- i have trouble with that but i guess one of those thing that be resolve by argument i accept your interpretation more delete ^^^^^^^^^ this be what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination be i correct i do not believe in predestination -- i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept god 's gift of salvation to u again fundamental difference which really be resolve yet more delete yes it be up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement a for now evil can be do by human being that be not god 's will -- and the best we can do be see taht some good come out of it somehow the thing that most worry me about the `` it be the will of god '' argument be that this will convince people that we should not stop the rape and kill when i think that it be most christ-like to do just that if jesus stop the stone of an adulterous woman perhaps this be not a good parallel but go to go with it anyway why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may or may not be more innocent"

b"a listmember d andrew killie i think write in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god any god who work that way be indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship or faith nobuya `` higgy '' higashiyama reply a in substance do others where be your source of moral standard by which you judge god's behavior it be often argue that we have no stand by which to judge god's action who be the clay to talk back to the potter but we find a contrary view in scripture when god proposes to destroy the city of suppose that there be some good men in the city will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked far be it from you lord to do such a thing shall not the judge of all the earth do right i be told that the hebrew be actually a bit strong than this and can perhaps be well render dynamic equivalence a shame on you lord if you do such a thing there be those who say that the definition of `` good '' be `` whatever god happens to want '' but if that be so then the statement that god be good have no meaning it simply say that god do what he want that be the case no one can either love or obey god because he be good the only motive left for obey him be that he be powerful just a it make sense to obey a dictator even when he tell you to round up all jew and exterminate them because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself so it make sense to obey god because he have the power to punish you if you this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to genesis 18 and to christianity in general any theory that make our moral judgement worthless make any far discussion of morality or of the goodness of god meaningless however it do not follow that our moral judgement be always infallible in particular case still less our judgement in particular case about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result when i read the scriptural account of the action of god in history those action often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a god who love u and desire what be best for u moreover leave the scripture aside and consider the natural world i find that nature be often very different from what i might '' those who believe that the author of nature be also the author of the scripture must expect to find in the scripture the same sort of difficulty that they find in nature '' now that some such difficulty should exist be not in itself an argument against the existence power wisdom and goodness of god on the contrary their absence would be such an argument suppose that i be watch bobby fisher play chess and suppose that every time he make a move i find myself nod and say `` good move just what i be expect him to do same move i would have make if i be play '' that would be a sign that fisher be no well a chess player than myself give that he be well i expect that at least some of his move will have me think `` now what do suppose induced him to do that '' or even `` boy that be a real slip -- just thrown the game away '' similarly if god understands the working of the universe well than i do it be to be expect that sometimes it will look to me a if he have make a mistake one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the control of the universe be that i can see the end of the chess game if fisher win i revise my earlier inference that it be carelessness that make him lose his queen 23 move earlier however if he loses and particularly if i can see that there be a time when he have an opportunity for a checkmate in two move and do not take it then i know that he be not a good a player a i have thought with god on the other hand i shall not in this life see the total result of some of his action therefore my ground for judging that i have see a bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my ground for make a similar judgement about fisher ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** in the book of genesis we read that joseph 's ten old brother who with good reason found him insufferable conspire to sell him into slavery in egypt there he eventually become viceroy and when there be a famine in canaan he be able to provide for his family when his brother nervously apologize he told them `` do not worry you meant to do me evil but god turn it into good '' the history of the jew be largely a history of event that look like catastrophe that threaten the continued survival of the religion or the people or both but amazingly those event turn out to be the save of the jew and of judaism the sale of joseph by his brother look like the breakup of the family but in fact it end with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them the famine that drove the family out of canaan look like a misfortune for them but in fact if they have stayed in canaan they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanite and be assimilate into their culture their oppression by the egyptian a few generation after their arrival in egypt again look like a disaster but god use it to bring them out of egypt and into the promise land here the people built a temple and regularly offer sacrifice but the babylonian capture jerusalem and judea destroyed temple and city and countryside and deport most of the people to babylon you might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion but it be not living in canaan the people have be under constant danger of assimilation again and again they have turn from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cult with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice the babylonian captivity put a stop to that never again do the jew show any interest in polytheism or idolatry neither the worship of the canaanite mor that of the babylonian ever again have a foothold among them nor be that all judaism have be in danger of become simply a system of sacrifice and temple observance the only prescribed act of worship consist of come to jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice during the captivity with the temple go the jew invent the synagogue a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scripture they come to realize clearly what they be in danger of forget while they continued to live in judea that god be not simply a local or tribal deity not just the controller of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish people but the creator of the world and the ruler and judge of all human everywhere time pass and the babylonian empire be replace by that of the persian and then that of the greek or rather the macedonian the ruler antiochus epiphanes be determine to stamp out judaism and to this end he make the reading and the study of the torah punishable by death again one might think that this would be the end of judaism but it be not the people met for worship and instead of reading the torah portion appoint for the day they would read some passage from the prophet that have a similar theme and then discus that before this time the torah the so-called five book of moses genesis exodus leviticus number and deuteronomy be the only book read and study in the synagogue if it have not be for antiochus the book of the prophet would probably have be forgotten altogether his hatred for judaism save them other example here omit for brevity 's sake some of you may remember that julie andrew first become famous a eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady when warner brother undertook to make a movie of it everyone expect that julie who have be so magnificent on stage would play the same role in the movie instead the studio decide to go with an establish screen star and cast audrey hepburn julie andrew be naturally crush but she later realize that if she have played the screen role she would have be type-cast for life a an elize doolittle type it would have be a disaster for her a it be walt disney offer her the role of mary poppins and she won an oscar for it at the presentation she stood there smile and look at walt disney she say `` and now my special thanks to the man who make all this possible -- jack warner '' it be the most memorable line of the even in a similar spirit we jew might thank the men who in the providence of god have preserve judaism and kept it alive to this day begin with joseph 's brother and continue with two pharaoh with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus epiphanes ... after the formal meeting have broken up one woman come up to him privately and say `` you be talk about the holocaust you '' he answer `` if that be an example that come to your mind then you be right i be talk about it to you but i would not talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it '' i assume that he meant that without the holocaust there would have be no state of israel someone hearing the rabbi 's lecture might leap to the conclusion that god be dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his purpose -- or at least that the rabbi thought so he might then go on to suppose that the wickedness be in fact god 's do -- that he stir up joseph 's brother to a murderous hate against him and that when the israelite be in egypt god harden pharaoh's heart so that he oppress the people and would not let them go and this raise question about how an action can be consider wicked and at the same time be consider something that god have brought about i suggest another way of look at it consider a sculptor who have a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue but the log instead of have a smooth even grain throughout have a large knot that spoil the appearance of the surface the sculptor considers the wood for a while and then carves a statue that feature the knot that make that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so that observer will say `` how fortunate the sculptor be in find a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place it presence be the crown touch the thing that make the statue a great work of art '' in reality the knot far from be what the sculptor be look for be a challenge to his skill if the wood have not contain that flaw he would still have make a great work of art but a different one so if joseph 's brother have not sell him god would still have brought about his purpose for the jewish people but he would have do so in another manner if juda have not betrayed jesus if caiaphas and his fellow leader have not reject jesus but have rather acknowledge him a the annointed of god if pilate have follow his conscience rather than his fear and have set jesus free it might appear that there would have be no crucifixion and therefore no redemption and therefore no salvation not so god do not need juda sin to redeem u if juda have do right then god in christ would still have reconcile the world to himself we do not know how just a we do not know how michelangelo would have paint the sistine chapel if it interior have instead be shape like grand central station and just a we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky if spassky have refuse the exchange of bishop and have attack fisher 's knight instead bother to look up the game in question -- i be make up this example but the point be none the less valid thus we may say both 1 that god use say the cowardice of pilate to accomplish his purpose and 2 that the say cowardice be not god 's do and that pilate would not have thwart god's plan by behaving justly and courageously what then be we to make of the place where god say to moses `` i will harden pharaoh 's heart so that he will not let the people go '' some christian have take this to mean that pharaoh be a puppet with god pull the string and that his stubbornness and cruelty be not his own work but the work of god in him i suppose rather that what god be tell moses be something like this `` if you see that pharaoh be not willing to let the people go do not be discourage or suppose that the situation be out of my control my purpose will not be thwart if pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go well and good if he do not i will fit his resistance into my plan and fit it so perfectly that future historian and theologian will suppose that i would have be thrown for a loss if pharaoh have obeyed me '' to return to the question that start this all off be it possible that the serb in slaughter the moslem of bosnia be instrument of god 's will first point what they be do be wrong just a what joseph 's brother do be wrong just a what juda do be wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow brings good out of it that do not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbian have refrain from the sin of robbery and rape and murder nor do the good he purpose excuse u from the duty of do what be right"

b"there may be some misunderstand over term here ... i agree quite likely actually ... i believe `` jesus only '' originally be in the context of baptism these be folk who believe that baptism should be do with a formula mention only jesus rather than father son and holy spirit this may have doctrinal implication but a far a i know it do not mean that these folk deny the existence or divinity of the father not the right one to describe this theology and in fact i think there may be several include what would classically be call monophysite or arian two rather different view a well a some who have belief that be probably consistent with trinitarian standard but who use trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it be not biblical -- clh not biblical what then can they make of the end of matthew 28:18 and jesus come and say to them `` all authority in heaven and on earth have be give to me 19 go therefore and make disciple of all nation baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit 20 and teach them to obey everything that i have command to you and remember i be with you always to the end of the age '' other ancient authority add *amen* nrsv the note give no sense that this be emend do other text contradict this regard baptism or be a misunderstand of the trinity the most likely explanation after all but maybe i simply misunderstand their view be anyone else out there force to read this group with both a good bible and an unabridged dictionary christianity really be an education in itself -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- arrgggghhhh when i talk about people who reject trinitarian language a unbiblical i be speak of trinitarian theology thing like `` one essense and three person '' obviously the three-fold baptismal formula be biblical a you point out i normally use the term `` three-fold '' in refer to mat while it be certainly consistent with belief in the trinity the trinity be a doctrine whose full formulation occur in the 4th and 5th cent 's unlikely that mat have in mind the fully-developed trinitarian doctrine indeed the three-fold baptismal formula be use by some group that do not believe in the trinity the disagreement over baptismal formula occurs because of passage such a act 2:38 which command baptism in the name of jesus there be a couple of other passage in act a well this leaf u with sort of a problem command in mat to baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and in act to baptize in the name of jesus `` jesus only '' group baptize in the name of jesus they consider this consistent with mat 28:18 because they say that jesus be the name of the father the son and the holy spirit not the right one to ask to explain what this mean i will simply say that it do not appear to be normal trinitarian theology it be also an odd way of deal with the idiomatic phrase `` in the name of '' those who use the three-fold formula seem to have a standard answer to the passage talk about baptizing in the name of jesus i suspect that the most common explanation be to say that `` in the name of '' need not be a verbal formula to say that you baptize in the name of jesus may simply mean that you be do baptism under jesus' authority in the 1st cent context it contrast christian baptism with the baptism of john or other jewish baptism of course there 's a certain parallelism between these passage that suggests that we could just a well say that mat 28:18 require the specific three-fold formula to be use in baptism but simply characterizes baptism do by those who follow the father son and holy spirit one might well suspect that in the early church more than one baptismal formula be use so long a we consider follow jesus to be the same a follow the father son and holy spirit no great damage would be do by such a difference this do *not* mean that i think we should go back to use both formula baptism be one of the few thing that almost all christian group now recognize mutually so i do not think do something to upset that would be in the interest of the gospel this be reinforce by the fact that those group that actually use `` in the name of jesus '' now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine but a say before not the one to explain what their doctrine be"
b"to what follow our moderator have already answer the charge of arrogance more ably that i could have do so so i will confine myself to answer the charge of illogic this be how everyone in the western intellectual tradition be or be taught to think it be the fundamental premis `` a be not not-a '' if a thing be true then it converse be necessarilly false without this basic asumption theology and science a we know them be alike impossible we should distinguish the strong and weak meaning of the word `` believe '' however the weak sense mean i be not sure `` i believe tom go to the library '' but he could have go to the track the strong sense mean i be so certain that i use it a a basis of thought `` i believe that nature operates accord to certain fundamental law '' despite the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable christian belief be of the strong kind though christian may well hold belief of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topic note that these be two separate idea most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second be be again a matter of pure logic that if christanity be true then hinduism for example must necessarilly be false insofar a it contradicts or be incompatible with christaianity and a a matter of *logic* vice versa it be arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* think or want unless they have told you christian believe god have told u what he think and want most christian do not base their belief on the bible but on the living tradition of the church establish by christ and guide constantly by the holy spirit the bible be simply the write core of that tradition if depends what you mean by differ if i believe tom be six foot tall and you believe he weighs 200 pound our belief differ but we may both be right if i believe tom be six foot tall and you beleive that he be four foot nine one of u at least must be wrong thus you believe that there be a single truth but that no human be can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth be mistaken in short you believe that anyone who do not share your belief on this point be wrong qed here i begin to suspect that your real difficulty be not with the knowability of truth but simply with language say that the glass be half empty be not a contradiction of the statement that it be half full it be the same fact express in different word the whole point of this phrase be to illustrate the different way the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact it be of course quite true that different people may express the same belief in different word it be also true that they may fail to understand each other 's word a expression of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they be mile apart great scisms have occur in just this way and much ecumenical work have be do simply in resolve difference in language which conceal agreement in belief this do not mean in any sense that all belief be equally valid since some of the belief people hold contradict some other belief that other people hold after all obfuscation of language and culture in the expression of those belief have be strip away some of the belief that some people hold must **necessarilly** be false and it be neither arrogant nor illogical to say so if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct but if y be equivalent to not-x then one of u be wrong and a long a we hold our respective belief we must each regard the other a in error"

b"i agree with carol here determine absolute be practically speak a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth be in fact relative for example i recently be ask some child the question `` what temperature do water boil at '' i get the answer 212 degree consistently i ask if they knew what scale and be told `` just 212 degree any scale what all thermometer say '' well sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it be simply wrong it be not an absolute truth similarly scripture be full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but try to determine which part be absolute truth and which part be the manifestation of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text be pen be miss the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip devoid of the living experience of the indwell trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head-covering in church delete this be a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the write but the simplest understand of the passage be that the instruction apply to the corinthian and not necessarily elsewhere the instruction may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which be have a lot of trouble with order be it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally yet to meet anyone who take the verse `` bless be he who take your baby and smash their head against the rock '' literally the bible be not print or hand to u by god with color coding to tell u what part should be interpret which way i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolute may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walk up and greets me i prove the existence of absolute i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god 's revelation that we can not fully comprehend the infinite therefore we comprehend the absolute so i need them i can never know the essence of god only the energy by and through which god be manifest to god 's creation so the reality can be that there be absolute but it be of no practical importance like claim that the original scriptural autograph be perfect but copy may not be swell who care it affect me in any practical useful way i might a well believe that god have make a lot of electric blue chicken and that they live on mar maybe god do so what be that go to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude lead many non-christians to believe that all christian be arrogant idiot incapable of critical reason christianity be true wonderful and sensible it appeal to reason since reason be an inner reflection of the logo of god explanation that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian response to a complex world note not claim there be no place for authority that 'd be silly there be a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative be en expression of authority that respect others authoritarian be en expression of authority that fails to do that and be generally agressive good parent like god be authoritative many christian be simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adult respond to this treatment larry overacker llo shell.com --"

b"dean velasco quote a letter from james m stowell president of moody bible institute there have be a lot of discussion but so far nobody seem to have hit on exactly what the criticism of `` arrogance '' be aim at the arrogance be attack be that we `` think we be the only one who know what the absolute be '' in short many evangelicals claim that they be infallible on the matter of religious text in particular the problem be one of epistemology a a shorthand you can think of epistemology a `` how do you know '' that question it turn out be a very trouble one the problem with absolute certainty be that at the bottom at least some of the think go on inside your own head unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head be infallible the reason you do to discover a source of truth be in question and that mean you do not have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which mean you do not have absolute certainty let 's take the specific example of biblical inerrancy and a fictional inerrantist name zeke the follow argument applies to the idea of papal infallibility too zeke have we presume spent some time study the bible and history and several other topic he have conclude base on all these study and possibly some religious experience that the bible be a source of absolute truth he may be correct but even if he be he can not be certain that he be correct his conclusion depends on how well he study history -- he may have make mistake and the reference he use may have contain mistake his conclusion depends on how well he study the bible -- he may have make mistake his conclusion depends on his own reason -- and he may have make mistake notice a common thread yet 8- everything about his study of the world that he do -- everything that happen in his own head -- be limited by his own think no matter what he do to try and cover his mistake he can never be certain of his own infallibility a long a any part of the belief be base on his own reason that belief can not be consider `` absolutely certain '' zeke believe that he have found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief be only a good a the quality of the search he make for it unless he can say that his own reason be flawless his conclusion be in doubt any belief that you hold about absolute source of truth depends in part on your own think -- there be no way out of the loop only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his belief this be easy to demonstrate let 's go back to our shorthand method of do epistemology `` how do you know '' imagine a hypothetical discussion a the bible be a source of absolute truth b how do you know a i study history and the bible and religious writing and church teaching and come to this conclusion b how do you know you study history correctly a well i double-checked everything b how do you know you double-checked correctly a well i compare my answer with some smart people and we agree b just because some smart guy believe something that mean it be true how do you know they study it correctly a ... and a you see b will eventually get a to the point where he have to say `` i prove that there be no mistake '' -- and a long a you may have make a mistake then you can not be absolutely certain there be no way out of the loop this be where the `` arrogance of christian '' arises many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrine of christianity -- they be implicitly claim that they be infallible and that there be no possibility of mistake claim that you can not have make a mistake and that your think have lead you to a flawless conclusion be pretty arrogant people who want to see this argument explain in great detail should try to find _the infallibility of the church_ by george salmon he be attack the idea that the pope can be knowably infallible and he do so very well but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the bible be knowably inerrant"

b"... seem to me if you learn to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you need to rely on doctrine that need to be update my experience of christianity 25+ year be that most christian seek answer from clergyman who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matter and that most of these question can be answer by simple introspection most people suspect that they can not trust their sens but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves not to get too esoteric but it seem that most religion christianity include be found by particularly intuitive people who understand this stuff delete and what if the original poster pixie be never `` convert '' do it make sense that she or i or the majority of humanity for that matter would go to hell for eternity a many christian believe it make more sense to me that rather than be convert to a centuries-old doctrine that hold no life for her that she simply continue to decide for herself what be best -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --"

b"i originally write to the person who ask this question personally but decide to post the information i have on the topic i spoke to the pastor of my parish catholic recently by coincidence on this subject his explaination be that while it be possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest it be important to have it recognize by the church a soon a it be possible because the church recoginizes itself a a community of believer member of the church to some degree be to be held accountable to each other to be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island there be many place in the world that do not have priest availible for marriage on a regular basis therefore couple get married without the priest be present but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one come through the area i remember a religion teacher in high school say that the marriage ceremony be not for the benefit of the couple a much a it be for the benefit of the community thus married couple have some responsibility to the community to stay married a divorce set a bad example for the community also the couple have vowed to become one with one another -- the community should be able to rely on that couple to be a one while couple may marry without witness they may not get anulments without a priest present an anulment be simply an admission of the church that what they have declare a marriage be not in fact a marriage at all for whatever reason so start get married in the back seat of a station wagon and give yourselves anulments a half-hour later i tend to agree with the response back there that say couple become married a soon a they consumate their marriage but i would add that couple should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex whether or not they intend to be married assume they be both willing partner to the sexual act the couple must be prepared to raise any child they may have a a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parent sex be a commitment i believe in god 's eye but digress ... god be with you"
b"in an earlier article i explain that what many people find arrogant about christian be that some christian profess absolute certianty about their belief and doctrine that be many christian insist that they can not have make any mistake when discover their belief which amount to say that they be infallible impicitly claim to be infallible be pretty arrogant most of u will probably agree in short the problem be that no matter how good your source be if any part of your doctrine or belief rest on your own think and reason then those doctrine be suspect so long a your own brain be involve there be a possibility for error i summarise the problem by write `` there be no way out of the loop '' someone call rexlex have claimed that there be a way out of the loop but he do not bother to explain what it be prefer instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument lead to relativism a i have explain to him before you can not reject an argument a false because you dislike where it lead the fact do not change just because however a any first-year philosophy student can explain what rexlex have write do not constitute a refutation all he have say be that he do not like what i write -- he have do nothing at all to dispute it there be two sentence in rexlex 's post that seem relevant to the point at hand i do not dispute that some truth can be verify through experience i have for example direct experience of add number i claim to be infallible at it -- in fact i remember do sum incorrectly -- but i do claim that i have direct experience of reason about number however once we go past experience thing and start reason about them we be on much shakier ground that be the point of the earlier article human brain be infest with sin and they can only be trust in very limited circumstance but how far do that get you once god 's revelation stop and your own reason begin possibility for error appear for example let 's suppose that our modern bible translation include a perfect render of jesus word at the last supper and that jesus say exactly `` this be my body '' presume that what he say be totally without error and absolutely true what can we be certain of not much at the moment he stop speak and people start interpret the possibility of error appear do he mean that literally or not we do not have any record that he elaborate on the word be he think of tran- or con- substatiation he say we interpret this passage use our brain we think and reason and draw conclusion but we know that our brain be not perfect our think often lead u wrong this be something that most of u have direct experience of 8- why should anyone believe that his reason -- which he know to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusion so give the assumption in this example what we can be certain of be that jesus say `` this be my body '' beyond that once we start make up doctrine and use our brain to reason about what christ reveal we get into trouble unless you be infallible there be very few thing you can be certain of to the extent that doctrine rely on fallible human think they can not be certain that be the problem of seem arrogant the non-christians around u know that human being make mistake just a surely a we know it they do not believe we be infallible any more than we do when christian speak a if they believe their own reason can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we be infallible -- the non- christian around u rarely believe that implicit claim witness be hardly go to work when the person you be talk to believe that you be either too foolish to recognise your own limit or intentionally try to cover them up i think it would be far well to say what thing we be certain of and what thing we be only `` very confident '' of for example we might say that we know our sin for recognise sin be something we directly experience but other thing whether base on reason from scripture or extra-biblical think should not be labled a infallible we should say that we be very confident of them and be ready to explain our reason but so far a i be aware none of u be infallible -- speak or act a if our think be flawless be ridiculous rexlex suggest that people read _he be there and he be not silent_ by francis schaeffer i think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer be grossly overrate by many evangelical christian somebody else might like it though so let my opinion stop you from reading it if someone be interested in my opinion suggest _on certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein"

b"i will answer this a i find time notice what i say about this book i call it `` easy reading '' the reason i drop philosphy a my major be because i ran into too many pharisaical simon 's i know how many walk encyclopedia 's i ran across in philosphy class the problem in know sooooo much more than your average lay person the problem come when you become puffed up about it schaeffer be just fine for the average lay person that be who he be writting to i suppose that you would have criticise john that his gospel be to simple talk with schaeffer one on one be in lecture with the man when he be be drill by philosphy student and prof 's from secular a well a christian university nd alone would fill both those catagories his answer be enough that the prof 's themselves often be take back and cause to re-think what their question be i saw this time and time again at different open forum so yes schaeffers book be by in large well simplistic it certainly grad level reading but we must get off our high horse when it come to recommend reading do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein i may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time also one must finally get beyond the doubt cause by *insistent* inquisitiveness one can not live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base look the christian wholeheartedly support genuine rationality but we must add a qualification to give this balance christianity be second to none in keep reason in it place we never know the value of a thing until we know it limit put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value this be why xianity be thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic it also explains the curious fact that it be rationalism and not christian faith which lead to irrationality if we forget the limit of a thing we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life '' more without limit be less less with limit be more '' or a i have so often state it freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom let 's put it another way the rationality of faith be implacably oppose to absurdity but have no quarrel with mystery think about that it can tell the difference between the two if you will let it christianity 's contention with rationalism be not that it have too much reason in it but that it have very little else when a christian come to faith his understand and his trust go hand in hand but a he continue in faith his trust may sometimes be call to go on by itself without his understand this be where the principle of suspend judgment applies at such time if the christian faith be to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgment and say `` father i do not understand you but i trust you '' now read all your objection of me into that statement i say i do not understand you at all but i trust you anyway '' it mean that `` i do not understand you *in this situation* but i do understand *why i trust you* anyway '' therefore i can trust that you understand even though i do not the former be a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity the latter be a statement of rationality of faith walk hand in hand with the mystery of faith so ... the principle of suspend judgment be not irrational it be not a leap of faith but a walk of faith a believer we can not always know why but we canalways know why we trust god who know why and this make all the difference now there be one obvious snag to all this and this be where i have part company with philosophy- what be eminently reasonable in theory be a rather bit more difficult in practice in practice the pressure of mystery act on faith like the insistent `` whying '' of a 3 year old it just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we can not know the one produce frustration because curiosity be deny the other lead to genuine anguish more specifically the poorer our understand be in come to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after come to faith if we do not know why we trust god then we will always need to know exactly what god be do in order to trust him fail to grasp that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we be able to trust if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be able to trust him in situation where we do not understand what he be do too many xian leader teach a if the christian have a window in the back of his head which allows for understand at every foot fall for what god be do may be ambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory it may be mystery to u but mystery be only inscrutable what would be insufferable be absurdity and that my friend be the conclusion of nietzche both in theory and in practice"
b"-and many others mail me here be a reply to one of the letter seem to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell your use 20th century concept to interprete 1st century writer of course in your termonology god could not `` cease to exist '' however that be not what death ever mean in the scripture if you will study the word you will see that it signifies `` separation '' death be separation not ceastation this be the reason for the agony of the cross for the first time in eternity one member of the godhead be separate from the other two i once met a young lady that be a beautiful a any model that ever live she be a personable a any saint ever imagine she be to become my '' girlfriend '' for several year however have be draft we be separate by distance to me that be a form of death later she decide that she wait for me to come home and bid me adue that to me be death it be separation from that which have make me whole death be separation and eternal death be eternal separation from his fellowship not because he chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to go there when i rebel against my earthly father he spank me i found no wisdom in that until i have grown old and especially until i have my own child he be try to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continued on my suicidal course he do it in love though i interpret it a harsh and unloving if god warns of impend danger that be love if choose to let u do a we please and then at the end tell u the rule that would be harsh you have a conscience no matter how calused or fall it be that witness to you that a thing be wrong and that there be cause for fear this may give light to the error of your understand one must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith faith and knowledge be inseparable jesus most certainly felt the `` pinprick '' of life a the scripture say heb 4:15 for we do not have a high priest who can not sympathize with our weakness but one who have be tempt in all thing a we be yet without sin the kenosis passage of phil 2 state that he give up his godhead attribute when he take upon himself humanity it have be a favorite meditation of mine to think about this it be to be my phd thesis `` the consciousness of christ '' i have talk at length with a great many people about this interest study include clh it be my conclussion that a jesus the 2nd member of the trinity actually suffer a we do he become part of the human race and experienced it a we do he `` grow in knowledge '' he chose not to grasp his omniscience but chose to be taught it be my understand that he be `` lead of the spirit '' to such an extent that sometimes it be hard to distinquish between jesus the man and jesus a god but in jn 8 where the adulterous woman be thrown before him the tense be quite clear in that the whole situation take him by surprise that be he be not aware that this event be to take place in time he be living sequential history a you or i. maybe some other time we can discus this but it be a very lengthy discussion and one that cause the curcuit breaker of the brain to pop more often than not i be once a member of that club the `` free thinker '' be a glorious ideal by contrast of course you believe that the believer be the unforunate repository of everything that be dogmatic inhibit reactionary and repressive i find such a stance to be a amuse a it be absurd if the liberal humanist wish to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist that be his right but what he must not pretend be that he be lead to this solely by his `` rational doubt '' when in fact he be lead to it by his `` faith '' he must acknowledge that while it be rational doubt for him a a `` free thinker '' to criticize the christian it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize him a a humanist if there be no faith there can be no dout there be no faith which can not choose to cast doubt on some other faith pascal point out that `` sceptical argument allow the positive to be positive few .speak dubiously of scepticism '' the fact that skeptic be not skeptical about skepticism be far evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else the person who be skeptical toward one faith or even most faith will be the devote adherent of another in fact it be a measure of his poverty both that he be unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative term hence the term `` a '' -theist some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism in my campus ministry i ran across this more time than i care to remember however they disprove their own argument with every thought every word every point of logic that they use every moment of share communication speaks against their total skepticism their very insistence of try to make sense be eloquent testimony to assumption that be powerful though silent that be to say that complete skepticism be impossible and limited skepticism be arbitrary next time in a room of skeptic yell out `` look your fly be undone '' each person chooses what he be skeptical about and what he believe without skepticism to stress this be to belabor the obvious but it underline the point that no one can know exhaustively how he know what he know pure objectivism be a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to this impasse lie in a 3rd way of know one which be base on presupposition but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presuppose before it be prove the cover be blown on the pretentions of critical doubt and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge be totally objective and neutral in other word another myth presupposition my friend it be impossible to doubt anything unless there be something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumption presuppostitons be our silent partner in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence of course that be hardly an original statement milton coin it but it have be in use for millenia it be even use in the first `` highlander '' movie but again your presuption be base on a faulty knowledge of the character of god you be operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology not what he have reveal of himself through history through his prophet through his word and lastly but most of all thru his son if you be to reject god 's annointed savior then reject him from a correct understand of himself"
b"i have a simple test i take several people who can speak only one language e.g chinese russian german english then i let the `` gift one '' start `` speak in toungues '' the audience should understand the `` gift one '' clearly in their native language however the `` gift one '' can only hear himself speak in his own language work everytime 8- perhaps i would believe the `` gift one '' more if they be glorify god rather than themselves then perhaps witness a real miracle --"
b'jesus god when jesus return some people may miss him what version of the bible do you read mike jesus be god incarnate in flesh jesus say i and the father be one jesus be take up to heaven after his 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angel who be there assure the apostle that jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the come why jesus warn that many would come claim to be him but that we would know when jesus actually return these be two very large part of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve'
b"good point -- it be very true that these `` false '' prediction be dangerous -- we be warn more than once in scripture about false prophtets however a be often the case with other issue one can not let those who falsly report such `` vision '' a a reason against believe in any of them i do not get the impression you be assert this by the way ... i consider my response not so much a response to your post but a response to the topic a a whole example the appearance of mary at fatima portugal in 1917. among other thing she predict the conversion of russia to atheism something that happen less than a year later w/ the bolshevik revolution she also predict the second world war that be predicte predict that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope who be not the current one it happen just like she say she warn there would be `` fire in the sky '' a a warn that the second world war be about to start about a week before germany invade weatherman and woman i suppose all over europe from england to spain to eastern europe report the most spectacular reddish color in the sky ever record to this day some try to explain it off a the northern light and the relation to mary's prediction simply coincidence you all can decide for yourselves mary predict that the atheistic russia would spread her evil all over the world and persecute religion she say many other thing a well too numerous to list here every single one have be realize one can only use the term `` coincidence '' so many time in the same explanation before it use becomes ridiculous so ... yes there be many false prophet and many false report there be true one too we must always remain open to that fatima be one example there be another one currently occur -- the apparition that have be take place at medjurgorje yugoslavia or whatever it call now mary have be appear every day for eleven year now time the world start listen"
b'john the problem here be that you have take one peice of my response without bother to connect it with the other part i have repeatedly note that one need to take the problematic historcity of act and then examine the work of john dominic crossan and burton mack once you have take the time to examine recent development in biblical scholarship i think you will grasp more clearly what i be say certainly this be an issue a i think the situation in waco show most clearly if all that be require be that people be willing to die for a belief for it to be true then surely david koresh be the son of god no the spurrious arguement that the resurrection have to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest the other problem be that it be so monologocentric even if the resurrection be a big deal which it seem to have be for either q thomas or even john to a certain degree there be a lot of other thing which the early christian could have be do together that would have be worth die for it be my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community which brought down regional/national boundary in the name of koinonia could have be enough for people to be willing to die radical communties do that e.g jonestown waco warsaw etc but my original point be that roman persecution which be the only persecution we have document proof of be not about whether a carpenter come back from the dead such a claim be not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind my point be that avoidance of military and civic duty i.e emperor worship would have be much more problematic -- which have nothing to do with the resurrection at all when nero use christian a human torch to light up his dinner party it because the believe in a risen savior it be because they be supposedly involve in incest and cannablism the argument that christian be martyr for the resurrection just can not stand up to critical examination'
b"religion especially christianity be nothing more than a drug some people use drug a an escape from reality christian inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high |your logic be falty if christianity be a drug and once we die we |die then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so that |while you be alive you enjoy yourself pardon the harshness that follow ... once i told a cradle christian please do not take advantage of jesus or anybody for the sake of your own selfish realization or search for true faith/religion/belonging/'being in'/fear of hell/vanity/etc instead of serve yourself _we must be serve him_ *until you have comprehend this truth you be only do thing for your own egoism let u not use jesus our religion the bible anything or anybody a a mean of escape or get ecstatic or high we be god 's child and we must have a true and authentic relationship with our father with obedience faith hope and love and work the last a the most important beware of our 'materialistic 'worldly and 'selfish motif atheist have this ground against u and i believe they be right about *some* who call themselves 'christians"
b"dear fellow netters from time to time a term like 'oneness pentecostal or something similar have occur in post to this group i also know that there be a movement call something like 'jesus alone i believe in the trinity and have no plan to change that but reently i be make aware that there be at least one person within our church who hold the view that there be no trinity in the near future we will discus this item and i feel that i shall ask you my friend on this group for background information can anybody tell me the basic reason for hold a belief that there be only jesus and vice versa the foundation for the trinity i shall appreciate both quote from the bible and historical development thank you all in him bjorn"
b"i have come across what i consider to be an excellent tract it be a bit lengthy for a post but i thought share it with all of you anyway feel free to pas it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it say may god richly bless those who read it ======================================================================= d o e s g o d l o v e y o u q. what kind of question be that anyone who can read see sign tract book and bumper sticker that say `` god love you '' that true a. it be true that god offer his love to the whole world a we read in one of the most quote verse in the bible for god so love the world that he give his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john 3:16 the way of the wicked be an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverb 15:9 for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm 1:6 q. but i be not wicked i be a decent moral person surely the good i have do in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have do how can these verse apply to me a. by god 's standard of righteousness even the most moral person be look upon by god a a desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teach that no one be good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we be all sinner and we be all guilty before god a it be write there be none righteous no not one there be none that understandeth there be none that seeketh after god roman 3:10-11 the heart be deceitful above all thing and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah 17:9 q. if i be such a wicked person in god 's sight what will god do to me a. the bible teach that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place call hell for a fire be kindle in mine anger and shall burn unto the low hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundation of the mountain i will heap mischief upon them i will spend mine arrow upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devour with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beast upon them with the poison of serpent of the dust deuteronomy 32:22-24 q. oh come on now hell be not real be it surely thing be not that bad a. indeed hell be very real and thing be that bad for the individ- ual who do not know the lord jesus christ a savior the bible make many reference to hell indicate that it be both eternal and consists of perpetual suffer and whosoever be not found write in the book of life be cast into the lake of fire revelation 20:15 so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wail and gnash of teeth matthew 13:49-50 ... when the lord jesus shall be reveal from heaven with his mighty angel in flame fire take vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punish with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power 2 thessalonian 1:7-9 q. that be terrible why would god create a hell a. hell be terrible and it exists because god create man to be accountable to god for his action god 's perfect justice demand payment for sin for the wage of sin be death roman 6:23 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the thing do in his body accord to that he hath do whether it be good or bad 2 corinthian 5:10 but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew 12:36 q. do that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell a. indeed it do that be unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sin that someone be god himself who come to earth a jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have go astray we have turn every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of u all isaiah 53:6 but he be wound for our transgression he be bruise for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace be upon him and with his stripe we be heal isaiah 53:5 for i deliver unto you first of all that which i also receive how that christ die for our sin accord to the scripture and that he be bury and that he rise again the third day accord to the scripture 1 corinthian 15:3-4 for he hath make him to be sin for u who knew no sin that we might be make the righteousness of god in him 2 corinthian 5:21 q. be you say that if i trust in christ a my substitute who be already punish for my sin then i will not have to worry about hell anymore a. yes this be so if i have believe in christ a my savior then it be a if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ a my substitute have already paid for my sin he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john 3:36 q. but what do it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that the bible say about christ a savior then be i save from go to hell a. believe on christ mean a whole lot more than agree in our mind with the truth of the bible it mean that we hang our whole life on him it mean that we entrust every part of our life to the truth of the bible it mean that we turn away from our sin and serve christ a our lord no man can serve two master for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye can not serve god and mammon matthew 6:24 repent ye therefore and be convert that your sin may be blot out when the time of refresh shall come from the presence of the lord act 3:19 q. be you say that there be no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religion will their follower also go to hell a. yes indeed they can not escape the fact that god hold u account- able for our sin god demand that we pay for our sin other religion can not provide a substitute to bear the sin of their follower christ be the only one who be able to bear our guilt and save u neither be there salvation in any other for there be none other name under heaven give among men whereby we must be save act 4:12 i be the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john 14:6 if we confess our sin he be faithful and just to forgive u our sin and to cleanse u from all unrighteousness 1 john 1:9 q. now i be desperate i do not want to go to hell what can i do a. you must remember that god be the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercy of god a you see your hopeless condition a a sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican stand afar off would not lift up so much a his eye unto heaven but smote upon his breast say god be merciful to me a sinner luke 18:13 ... sir what must i do to be save and they say believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be save ... act 16:30-31 q. but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a. wonderfully god not only save u through the lord jesus but he also give u the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ a your savior for by grace be ye save through faith and that not of yourselves it be the gift of god ephesian 2:8 god work particularly through the bible to give u that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which be the only word of god in this brochure all verse from the bible be within indent paragraph give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god roman 10:17 q. but do this mean that i have to surrender everything to god a. yes god want u to come to him in total humility acknowledge our sinfulness and our helplessness trust totally in him the sacrifice of god be a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm 51:17 because we be sinner we love our sin therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sin and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sin a god strengthens u we know that our sin be send u to hell unto you first god have raise up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turn away every one of you from his iniquity act 3:26 q. the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptize will these save me a. if possible we should do these thing but they will not save u no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation be god's sovereign gift of grace give accord to his mercy and good pleas- ure salvation be not of work l any man should boast ephesian 2:9 q. what else will happen at the end of the world a.

the timing of the history of the world and tell u that while the day of the lord will come a a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come a a thief for the believer there be much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clue in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh

compare it with what the bible actual- ly say find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future hold that i have ever come across and agree with him that there be just too much data to ignore while none of u be guaranteed one more second of life and while we therefore should take these matter very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return it would appear that

b"there seem to be many point to the speak in tongue thing which be problematic use a prayer language seem especially trouble to me i understand that when you pray in tongue the spirit be do the talk and when you pray you pray to god and the spirit be god so the spirit be talk to himself which be why i only go by the pentecost use where an actual language moreover the phrase `` though i speak with the tongue of men and angel '' use by paul in i cor be mislead out of context some would then assume that there be some angelic tongue and if when they speak it be no know language then it be an angelic tongue hmmm ... in the old testament story about the tower of babel we see how god punish by give u different language can we assume then that if angel have their own language at all that they have the same one amongst other angel after all they be not punish in any manner so why do these suppose angelic tongue all sound different from one another disturb to think that some people find way to justify jabbering but i 'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learn trouble be while such story abound any and all attempt at verification and we be to test the spirit ... either show that the witness have no real idea of the circumstance or that outright fabrication be involve the brother puka story in a previous post seem like a `` friend of a friend '' thing and linguistically a two syllable word hardly qualifies a language inflection or no"
b"in a word yes i believe that physical knowledge have a great deal of impact on the power of god in the past god give u the ability to create life through sexual relation now he be give u the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization the difference between the two be merely cosmetic and even if we gain the ability to create universe we begin to approach the glory of god the power we be be give be a test and i be sure that in many case we will use our new ability unwisely but people have be use sexuality unwisely for millenia and i heard an outcry to abolish it yet no matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world we impinge on god 's power only when we attempt to gain control of the spiritual world those thing that be approach through science and logic that we begin to interfere with god"
b'let me carry that a step far most doctor would not claim to be infallible indeed they would generally admit that they could conceivably be wrong e.g that in this case a blood tranfusion might not turn out to be necessary after all however the doctor would have enough confidence and conviction to claim out of genuine concern that be be necessary a fallible human being they must acknowledge the possibility that they be wrong however they would also say that such doubt be not reasonable and stand by their conviction'
b"i be ask you to believe in thing not visible i know if this be believeing blindly or not not sure how blindness come into it i do not deny reason indeed i insist upon it but reason only draw conclusion from evidence if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical sens then you cut reason off from any possibility of reach a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the rather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphere be not self explanatory christian claim that they have receive a different kind of evidence which they call faith and which be a gift of god that be this evidence be the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself the evidence of the sens can not tell you be such a ting exists reason on the evidence of the sens help either but christian do reason of the evidence of faith and do claim that this evidence be wholly consistent with the evidence of the other sens and indeed that the evidence of these other sens be part of god 's revelation of himself to u it be not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a god must come through this route there may be other sens than the physical one provide evidence of non-physical reality there may of course be physical reality of a type for which we have no correspond sens for all we know these sens if they exist may provide valid evidence for reason to work on and a with all sens these sens may be impaired in some people that be they may be spiritually blind in this sense belief in god becomes an act of sight and it be disbelief which be blind faith a i have say be not oppose to reason it be simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate it be clear that human being have many system for explain the evidence of the physical sens and similarly there be many system for explain the evidence provide by faith religious believer in general and christian in particular use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understand of the evidence provide by faith science claim with good reason to be the most valid system for explain the physical universe and christianity claim also with good reason to be the most valid system possess of the best evidence for explain god revelation of himself to man if you doubt that christian use reason read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty"

b"first of all `` ceremonial law '' be an extrascriptural term it be sometimes use a a framework to view scripture but if you look at collosions without go into it with the assumption that the sabbath can not be a ceremonial law you will see that it do refer to the sabbath against u to his cross and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat what we drink the keep of new moon and holy day or the keep of the sabbath the word for sabbath in this verse be `` sabbaton '' and be use throughout the new testament to refer to the 7th day if there be any scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law this be one of them and the sabbath be list among the ceremonial law if one go into this with the fundamental assumption `` the sabbath can not be a ceremonial law '' then he will have to find some way around it like say that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy day besides the 7th day because `` the sabbath can not be a ceremonial law '' but paul be very careful in his letter to add some kind of parenthetcal statement if there be anything that can be see a a liscence to sin in his writing also why be the sabbath absent from the epistle except for hebrew 4 which talk about the rest that come through faith surely it would have be a big problem for first century christian living in a society that do not rest on the 7th day especially slave many new converst be slave it would have be difficult for slave to rest on the sabbath if it have be mandatory why be there no mention of this in the epistle"

b"the discussion begin why do the universe exist at all must there be a `` why '' to this i ask because of what you also assume about god -- namely that he just exists with no `` why '' to his existence so the question be reverse `` why we assume the universe just exists a you assume god to `` just exist '' why must there be a `` why '' to the universe '' one of the law of nature specify cause and effect seem to dictate at least to this layman 's mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists a far a i can tell the very law of nature demand a `` why '' that true of something outside of nature i.e. *super*natural ... it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man now i see this happen in my lifetime nor do i assert it be probable but the possibility be there give scientist be work hard at `` decode '' out `` genetic code '' to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation again though must there be `` why '' or a `` divine prupose '' to man 's existence i believe the `` genetic code '' will be entirely decipher in our lifetime but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustain reproduce life *ever* never be much of a prophet though i even *picture* new york in my mind 8^ i believe *any* technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life despite have all of the part available just my opinion when you say that man be *only* an animal i have to think that you be present an unprovable statement -- a dogma if you will and one the require a kind of `` faith '' too by take such a hard line in your atheism you may have stumble into a religion of your own a far a we can tell man fall into the `` mammal '' catagory now ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ that preposition sort of precludes an absolute it without an absolute conclusion what be we left with i believe the word `` faith '' work nicely if there be something more to the man say a soul then we have yet to find evidence of such but a it be now man be a mammal baby be born live mother give milk warm-blooded etc a other mammal be and be similar in genetic construction to some of them in particular primate for more on this check out talk.origins but before you write off all christianity a phony and shallow i hope do a little research into it history and variety perhaps by reading paul johnson 's `` a history of christianity '' from your remark it seem that you have be expose to certain type of christian religion and not others even an atheist should have enough faith in man to know that a movement of 2000 year have to have some depth and be animate by some endure value well then buddhism confucianism taoism hinduism judaism zoerasterism shintoism and islam should fit this bit of logic quite nicely ... all have depth all have endure value thus all must be true ... well then with an *equal* scale and under an *equal* standard investigate them all and discover where god be or *whether* he be for the denial of god be ultimately a statement of faith non-falsifiable a his existence may be for this the purpose of religion to discover and in discovery to *know* god you mind if a few of u send up a prayer on your behalf during your research do you after all if we of christ be delude ourselves you really have nothing to worry about eh until the king return jason"
b"hmmm ... people in the america before the time of christ child who die young etc but of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect be something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least i think a good number of atheist believe there be nothing beyond bodily death but it be simply an abuse of language to say they believe go to hell they believe go to _die_ understand that turn hell into a verb use the same logic it also follow that all animal be 'going to hell be you sure this be what you want to say presumably animal have the opportunity to get to heaven but this still change the fact that go to hell die a final death i claim to know whether or not there be an afterlife of _some_ sort but if hell be a you described final death and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that there will never be a moment when i be aware of my non-existence assume i 'go to hell and not to heaven in other word i'll never know dead hmmm ... ever hear people say of a love one who be ill and have die `` at least s not suffer any more s in heaven now '' consider the follow statement `` at least s not suffer any more s in hell now '' the above statement sound odd but accord to your definition of hell it would be a true statement the person in hell would not be suffer grant they be *anything* be have any conscious experience whatsoever you say hell death be eternal however this loses it meaning to a dead person and to me it seem that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only make sense/has force if one expect to be conscious throughout this eternity many atheist believe that the thirst for an afterlife be simply the product of propaganda `` friend do you want the free gift of e-ternal life '' my understand that the early jew do not believe in an afterlife can anyone back me up on this combine with the survival instinct all animal share the difference be we have consciousness and once we get the idea of eternal life drill into our brain we then desire a sort of super-survival that would depend on what heaven be like if god be a king and an eternity in heaven consists of give thanks and praise to the king i might opt for hell i read a lovely account of a missionary try to convert eskimo to christianity in the book _the illusion of immortality_ by corliss lamont the missionary start to speak about heaven `` be there seal in heaven will we be able to go hunt '' ask an eskimo the missionary say no the group of eskimo then say something to the effect of `` well what good be your heaven if there 's no hunt scram '' i highly recommend the above book ioi to anyone who want an account of the other side of the immortality coin that there be no immortality pax"
b".. hello firstly what do you exactly mean by `` fundamentalist '' i will for the time be assume that what you mean be that your friend believe that the bible be god 's word to mankind i suspect that what happen to him be what call be `` born again '' anyway be that recent if the answer be `` yes '' to all the question above it be quite understandable however imo i'ld rather give advice to your friend i think be through something similar to him and one thing i can say be that the basic problem be that each of you be now try to communicate from different worldviews why he talk about those thing be because they be now `` obvious '' to him what be `` obvious '' to him be not obvious to you secondly why he may be very persuasive be because from his point of view he have be on `` both side of the fence '' this i mean that before he turn `` fundamentalist '' you two be agreeable because both of you see thing from the same side if suddenly a if a new world of reality have suddenly open up to him it be like the discovery of let 's say a new continent or a new planet to him get to tell you because he have see something much more wonderful than where he be and what he think be much well than where you be now you have get to realise that from his point of view he mean well to you eventhough he may end up offend you to him it be worth that risk nevertheless it be really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you a well at this moment it may be difficult because he be either very excite or feel it be too urgent to keep quiet about however he may not realise that really put you off ... so far only be try to explain thing from his side however i do understand how you feel too because i a christian for a good part of my life a well i be quite turn off by christian or '' fundamentalist '' who be really all out and enthusiastic about their faith they really scar me to tell you the truth unfortunately '' religious belief '' be a very personal thing just a your agnosticism be also a very personal thing to you since the christian belief be inevitably at odds with anything non-christian religious or otherwise it will be a touchy matter like all friendship it will take both side to do their part to make it work in this matter maybe you can do your part by tell him nicely that you be not able to dig what try to convince you about that beyond you or not your concern '' for now '' tell him nonsense because to him it be reality and that would be a real insult also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too like i say before i wish i could give your friend some advice too i 'll admit that i do similarly to some of my friend when i become a christian in some way i wish i could have do thing a little differently however it be difficult then because i be so excite and just blabber away about what found to me it be too good not to know to some i be crazy and i really care most of the time what they thought you will probably think crazy too but god be very real to him a real a you be to him keep that in mind and he think he can convince you because since god be so real to him he see why god be real to you too i know how helpful this be to you but all the best anyhow this be quite a challenge for you to face by the way personal conviction nobody be `` beyond save '' except the one we call the devil and his host"
b"and yet jayne a we read the gospel and in particular the topic that jesus himself spoke on hell figure in a large of the time -certainly more than heaven itself paul a we learn in i thess taught new believer and new church eschatology and do not hesitate to teach hell and damnation rev chapter 20:11-15 be very specific and can not be allegorize i think the word '' throne '' be use 45 time in rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement for in john 3 we read that they be already judged rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut there be no recourse excuse or defense yes i agree with you life be often like a pendulum where it swing to extreme before stop at `` moderation '' i think we have see the extreme of the `` hell fire brimstone '' preacher but also we have see the other extreme where hell not talk about at all for fear of offend someone sensibility i forget who found the word of life ministry but i remember him tell a story he be in a small town hardware store and some how a man get to the point of tell him that he believe in satan or hell he believe everybody be go to heaven it be at this point that the man be ask to pray to god that he would send his child to hell of course the man do it but the point be make many people say they believe in hell but they be not willing to really place their faith in that it exist if this man have he would of prayed the prayer because hell exist and there would have be no fear in have his prayer answer and yet they walk a if they believe they will never be sent there use a different illustration however i have to include myself in it when i watch say a basketball go bull game and i see a blatant foul that call oi vey what 's with that ref that he make that call unfair and just so in life righteousness demand payment a the surgeon take knife in hand to cut the cancer away so god cut off that which be still of the old creation we must preach the gospel in all it richness which include the fact that if you reject the way and the truth and the life then broad be the way to distruction i think i would fall in there somewhere actually it be both after all repentance only a turn towards but also a turn away from no again if jesus use it in his ministry then i can surely see that we should do it also in love of course but in truth most assuredly i have thought about write something on this topic but not now and here i would say that there be some good reason for it existence and it eternality 1 god be light yes he be love but his love have the boundary of holiness 2 dignity of man either a man be a robot or he be a responsible creature if responsible then he be also accountable 3 the awfulness of sin today we have a poor poor concept of sin god 4 christ he be willing to die and go there himself to offer an avenue to the `` whosoever will ''"
b"the bible do tell u that government be ordain by god roman 13 and furthermore god foreknows everything that would happen it be just to difficult for human to graps with our limited mind the inevitablity of the sucess of god 's plan and this be especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts do evil however though they be do evil and we should not cooperate with them when they do such it must be understood that what happens be what god want so a to lead to the final sucess of his plan to save a many soul from hell a be possible in short the slaughter in bosnia though deplorable in the eye of god maybe then again they might be get their just desert now rather than later there be plenty of example of god kill people for their sin onan in the old testmament for example and annias and spahira in the new be what he will to happen so that his plan might be accomplish but forget it be not unbiblical for god to use one nation to execute his just judgement upon another the roman be use to fulfill the chorus of `` let his blood be upon our hand '' of the crowd in jersualem and chaldea be chastise by babylon which get israel which be inturn gotten by persia etc god do use nation to punish other nation a the bible very clearly show in the old testament you remember the word of god record in daniel `` mene mene tekel peres '' babylon have be weigh in the balance scale of god's justice found severly want and be thus give over to the persian a their due punishment for their rebellion another exammple be the extirmination of the cannanites order by god a the task of israel the cannanites have be give their chance found severly want and the great judge carry out his just sentence accrodingly i could go on with more example but i see little need to do so a my point be quite clear two thing need to be remember at all time 1 it be not up to u to question why god have order the world a he have in his divine wisdom he make the world a be best in his eye and like paul say in roman 9 the clay be not one to tlak back to the potter 2 the message of jesus christ be a follow `` repent now for the kingdom of heaven be at hand '' jesus christ do not allow any time for dilly-dallying `` let the dead bury the dead come follow me '' there be not an infinite amount of time rather christ be passing by right now call people to follow him and become fisher of men he do not say `` well alright you can call me back in a week and see if my kingdom fit in with your plan '' he say `` follow me '' his message be not `` just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly get all the time in the world and divine judgement only a fairy tale '' `` our great god and savior '' jesus christ titus 2.5 be also the just and righteous judge of the world and it be not up to the defendant in the trial to be question his entirely just sentence of either chastisement or mercy"

b"very interest but i also believe that you have present a mislead argument christianity be not the cause of the massacre and horrific injustice that you relate rather they be the fault of people who misunderstand jesus christ 's message and modify it to suit their own belief and aim rather than alter their ambition to be more in line with those present a desirable in the new testament with every truthful and good message that carry authority or imply authority come the inevitable fact that some many people will understand it in a distort way with inevitable consequence the bible 's message be that we be to love all people and that all people be redeemable it preaches a message of repentance and of give unfortunately all people have deceitful heart and be capable of turn this message around and contort it in sometimes unbelievable way this be also a fundamental christian doctrine one of the problem be that you look at the world through the eye of western history i think that you will find many many case of massacre that be instigate by people who never claimed they be christian i be not say this to justify the massacre that be but i be merely point you to a tendency which be present in human already consider the world without christianity i doubt that we would have the same freedom in the country in which we live if it for the peaceful doctrine of jesus christ perhaps we would even be confront by a very harsh religion i name any here though one come to mind which would not even allow u the freedom of speech to debate such subject point the blame at inherent human tendency of thirst for power greed and hatred please point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental give and denial in love for others yours in christ andrew mcveigh p.s i believe that a line of question like you present be strangely enough compatible with become a christian certainly christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world and especially christian i praise god for jesus christ and the fact that we can doubt our belief and still come back to god and be forgiven time and time again -- *****"
b"i be not so sure of jewish proselytism then but i would like to relate an account of a recent dinner i have with jew a few month ago the dinner be instigate by the aunt of the hostess whom i have met while visit my wife in galveston last october the dear old aunt now decease be very proud of her jewish heritage although not especially devout her parent be both murder in nazi concentration camp in austria during wwii because they be jewish while converse with her about politics world affair and religion she remark that it would be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to atlanta within two day of return to atlanta her niece call to invite me over for dinner with her husband i go not know really what to expect other than stimulate conversation and fellowship what i get however be rather unexpected the thrust of the even 's discussion be to condemn the reagan-bush policy prohibit abortion counsel in federally fund family planning clinic prohibit the sterilization of minority on welfare here and in puerto rico on the ban on fetal tissue research and against the mexico city policy '' which denies u.s. foreign aid to program overseas that promote abortion '' the crux of their position be to place the blame for the problem of '' overpopulation '' rampant domestic crime african starvation unwed mother etc. on christianity rather on the fall of adam now this be not what i have to come to talk about but every time i try to bring up the subject of judaism they would condemn jew for jesus and admonish me against convert to judaism `` because it involves too much study and effort '' and i do not even raise the prospect nor try to convert them to the truth of christ there be certainly no jewish proselytism go on there and again last november i tour a `` traditional '' jewish synagogue and be subject to a 30-minute harangue against jesus and christianity in general i realize that these be two isolated incident and that the best supervisor i ever have at work be jewish but from my experience the modern jew be not know for his proselytism -- boundary"

b"can someone cite biblical reference to homosexuality be immoral other than leviticus so far when i ask around here i get the verse from leviticus spout at me but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignore by christian see any stoning in a _long_ time later max bob muir the list be post not long ago a i recall aside from lev commonly cite passage be the story of sodom note however that this be a homosexual rape and there 's no disagreement that that be wrong i take an intermediate position on this note that sodom be refer to elsewhere in the bible for it sinfulness it seem to have be know specifically for homosexuality rather i think it be consider a cesspool of all sin however from what we know of jewish attitude homosexuality would have contribute to the horror of the action described it almost seem to have be contrive to combine about a many form of evil in one act a possible homosexual rape of guest who be actually angel but this story be not specifically about homosexuality in the nt the clear reference be all from paul 's letter in rom 1 there be a passage that presupposes that homosexuality be an evil note that the passage about homosexuality -- about idolatry homosexuality be visit on people a a punishment or at least result of idolatry there be a number of argument over this passage it do not use the word `` homosexuality '' and it be refer to people who be by nature heterosexual practice homosexuality so not what call an explicit teach against all homosexuality but it do seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway that paul share the general negative jewish attitude towards homosexuality the other passage occur in list of sin in i cor 6:9 and i tim 1:10. unfortunately not entirely clear what the word use here mean there have be suggestion that one have a broader meaning such a `` wanton '' and that another may be specifically `` male prostitute '' again we have here a precise teach about homosexuality but it be at least weak supportive evidence that paul share the ot 's negative judgement on homosexuality jude 1:7 be sometimes cite however probably not relevant the context in jude involves angel since those who be almost rap in sodom be angel it seem likely that `` strange flesh '' refers to intercourse with angel a you can see the nt evidence be such that people 's conclusion be determine by their approach to the bible conservative note that the passage from paul 's letter imply that he accepted the ot prohibition this be enough for them to regard it a have nt endorsement liberal note that there 's no specific teach and no clear definition of what be be prohibit or why be the concern in rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship what exactly do the word in the list of sin mean thus some believe it be legitimate to regard this a a attitude paul take with him from his background and not a specific teach of the gospel this be an explosive topic which tends to result in long dissertation on the exact meaning of various greek word but clear to me that mostly irrelevant what it really come down to be whether people be look to the bible for law or whether they believe that such a approach be inconsistent with the gospel this appear to depend upon one 's reaction to the message of the bible a a whole a well a one 's perception of the need of the church today this be a difference of approach at least a serious a the difference between protestant and catholic in the 16th cent and one where both side believe that the bible be so obviously on their side that they keep think all they have to do be quote a few more passage and the other side will finally come to their sens that make thing very frustrate for a moderator who realizes that such an optimistic outcome be not very likely ..."

b"whether there be a `` why '' or not we have to find it this be pascal 's wager if there be no why and we spend our life search then we have merely waste our life which be meaningless anyway if there be a why and we search for it then we have waste our potentially meaningful life suppose the universe be 5 billion year old and suppose it last another 5 billion year suppose i live to be 100. that be nothing that be so small that it be scary so by search for the `` why '' along with my friend here on earth if nothing else we so scar what if you woke up at a party with no memory and everyone be discuss who the host might be there might not be a host you say i say let 's go find him the party 's go to be over sometime maybe let u stay because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the `` why '' this be a good point but more of a good point for study religion than ignore it some christian disagree with me but it be worthwhile to study different religion and philosophy and glean the truth from them to quote of course out of context `` test everything and keep what be true ''"

b"insert deletion of unnecessary quote first of all god do not take any sort of pleasure from punish people he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion ex 33:19 however if he enjoy punish people and send them to hell then why would he send jesus to `` seek and save that which be lose '' luke 19:10 you ask for it 2 peter 2:4-ff talk about how those who be ungodly be punish matthew 25:31-46 be also very clear that those who do not righteous in god 's eye will be sent to hell for eternity 2 thessalonian 1:6-10 state that those who cause trouble for the disciple `` will be punish with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord '' 2 thessalonian 2:9-12 talk about those who refuse to love the truth be condemn revelation 21:6-8 talk about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not those who do not list in verse 8 will be in the `` fiery lake of burning sulfur '' revelation 14:9-12 give the indication that those who follow the beast '' will be torment with burning sulfur '' and there be `` no rest day or night '' for them because of it psalm 9:17 `` the wicked return to the grave all the nation that forget god '' i think those should be sufficient to prove the point joe fisher in the follow mostly play `` devil 's advocate '' not advocate either position my concern be that people understand that possible to see these passage in different way possible to see eternal destruction a just that -- destruction rev often us the term `` second death '' the most obvious understand of that would seem to be final extinction the problem be that the nt speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death i.e it us term that can be understood either way my concern here be not to convince you of one view or the other but to help people understand that there 's a wide enough variety of image that possible to understand them either way a tom albrecht comment the primary point be to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire whatever the detail to make thing more interest luke 20:35 implies that the damn get resurrect at all presumably they just stay dead -- yes aware that possible to understand this passage in a non-literal way 2 peter 2:4-ff be talk about angel and talk about hold them in hell until the final judgement this eternal punishement matthew 25:31-46 talk about send the curse into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angel the fact that the fire be eternal mean that people will last in it flame forever particularly interest be the comment about the fire have be prepared for the devil and his angel rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire a well they say that the beast and the false prophet will be torment forever in it when talk about people be thrown into it 20:13-14 it be refer to a `` the second death '' this sound more like extinction than eternal torment be be possible that the fire have different effect on supernatural entity such a the devil and human 2 thessalonian 1:6-10 similarly what be `` everlasting destruction '' this be not necessarily eternal torment this one can clearly be understood either way but i think at least possible to think that everlasting be be use to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity 2 thessalonian 2:8 again talk about destruction revelation 21:6-8 see comment above revelation 14:9-12 be probably the best of the quote even there it explicitly say that the people suffer forever it say that the smoke and presumably the fire be eternal and that there be no respite from it but it say that the people be torment forever psalm 9:17 i see that it say anything relevant to this issue"

b"hi ... not a religious guy so dont take this a some kinda flame thanx in advance i want to know why there be so many different version of the bible there '' ... .contains inaccurate data and inconsistency '' thanx in advance ... shaz ... not sure quite what you mean by many different version the primary distinction in version you see today be in the style of the translation pretty unusual to see significant difference in meaning there be a few difference in the underlie text because before printing manuscript be copy by hand slight difference result there be enough manuscript around that scholar can do a pretty good job of recreate the original but there be some uncertainty fortunately they be generally at the level of minor difference in word there be something like 3 or 4 place where whole sentence be involve but with recent discovery of old manuscript i think there's much uncertainly about those case a far a i know no christian believe that the process of copying manuscript or the process of translate be free of error but i also think there's enough uncertainty in establish the text or translate it that it have much practical effect whether the bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences be a hot topic of debate here many christian deny it some accept it though most would say that the inaccuracy involve be on detail that affect the faith but this have nothing to do with there be multiple version the suppose inconsistences can be found in all the version surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though what version be you talk about be refer to major scholarly translation these be what get reference in posting here and elsewhere there have certainly be edition that be to be kind less widely accepted this include everything from reconstruction that combine parallel account into single narration to edition that omit material that the editor object to for some reason or the other the copyright on the bible have long since expire so there nothing to stop people from make edition that do whatever wierd thing they want however the edition that be widely use be carefully prepared by group of scholar from a variety of background with lot of crosscheck i could imagine one of the lesser-known edition claim to have fix up all inaccurate data and inconsistency but if so not any edition widely use the widely use one leave the text a be weeeeelllllll almost a be be allege that a few translation have fudge a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistency because translation be not an exact science there be always go to be difference in opinion over which word be best afraid"
b"from time to time i have make reference to a book call `` the two babylon '' which be a book write by alexander hislop mid 1800 's about the babylonian mystery religion and it flight through history i be unable to put it down the first time i read it but others have found it dry it have numberable reference and illustration if you be interested in purchasing your own copy you can call moody book store 312 329-4352 and order it for 16.99 and they will ship it to you it be a good book just to get the reference title for your own dig into the mystery religion i have found it invaluable for that purpose alone but for those who only want to skim the subject it come highly recommend just a note to my rc brother and sister you may find this to be a diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the origin of rcism if you be offend by anything that asks hard question about your denomination a to whether or not it be `` christian '' then perhaps you should just passover this offer to those who be a little more adventurous go for it and later please contact me with you reason pro or con on the scholorship of this book i really would be interested"

b"note i be cross-posting actually email this to bit.listserv.catholic while main post go to soc.religion.christian quotation omit this be in response to a question about the immaculate conception i explain it but left justification up to our catholic reader -- clh there be no direct reference in the holy scripture except for the mention of mary 's _blessedness_/full of grace in the `` annunciation '' by angel gabriel in luke 1:26-28 and in the 6th month the angel gabriel be sent from god unto a city of galilee name nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name be joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name be mary and the angel come unto her and say '' hail thou that art highly favour the lord be with thee bless art thou among woman `` now now hold that line of thought `` the lord be with mary bless art thou among woman '' while you read on ... in the book `` first lady of the world a popular history of devotion to mary '' by peter lappin the _immaculate conception_ matter be really far more complicate than the _assumption_ this arose in 430 ad it be quite possible that the feast of _mary 's conception_ under the title `` the conception of saint anne '' originally commemorate the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing conceive a daughter just a elizabeth have conceive john the baptist a transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in anne to the miracle of grace wrought by god in the soul of mary be _logical_ mary be the incorruptible timber `` out of which be hewn the _tabernacle_ of christ 's sinless body '' she be `` god 's eden in whom there be no tree of knowledge and no serpent that harm '' her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in christ her purity in that of the father at the time of the council of ephesus she be hail a `` innocent without blemish immaculate inviolate spotless holy in soul and body who be bless a a lily from among thorn unlearned in the evil way of eve '' ... at the end of the thirteenth century an irish franciscan john dun scotus 1266-1308 ... god maintain that it be a great thing for him to preserve his the son mother from all sin _than to use his power to clease her from it later_ ... now let 's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin from `` pocket catholic cathechism '' by john a. hardon baptism concupiscence remains after baptism concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptize but since it be left to provide trial it have no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of christ jesus manfully resist canon 5 original gift of adam and eve before their fall in the light of the forego we see that our first parent be originally gift three time over -they have the natural gift of human being especially the power to think and to choose freely -the have the _preternatural_ gift of bodily immortality and of integrity or the internal power to control desire -they have the _supernatural_ gift of sanctify grace the virtue of faith hope and charity and the correspond title to enter heaven by their disobedience they lose the _supernatural and preternatural_ gift entirely and be weaken without lose their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lose by adam's sin it _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gift but gift a a title to a glorify restoration of our body on the last day ... go back to _immaculate conception_ i be not sure if this interpretation be in any other book but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle give the miracle of st. anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age and christ be not yet born and _there be no baptism yet_ on mary 's birth but still the angel gabriel 's greeting be '' hail mary full of grace the lord be with you bless art thou amongst woman '' even mary be confuse about this greet mary could very well have possess all of the _treefold original gift above_ give to our first parent adam and eve before their sin hail mary example of praise give by the angel gabriel full of grace natural preternatural supernatural the lord be with you at those time god would definitely want to be with those he have make _blessed_ bless art thou amongst woman that say it all at the conception god make mary _full of grace and blessed_ a the 'tabernacle for the come body of christ and so immaculate conception of mary be true and mary still have maintain her immaculate heart"

b'perhaps we have different definition of absolute then to me an absolute be something that be constant across time culture situation etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition i think you do a simple example in the new testament sorry i have a bible at work and provide a reference woman be instruct to be silent and cover their head in church now this be scripture by your definition this be truth and therefore absolute do woman in your church speak do they cover their head if all scripture be absolute truth it seem to me that woman speak in and come to church with bare head should be intolerable to evangelicals yet clearly woman do speak in evangelical church and come with bare head at least this be the case in the evangelical church i grow up in evangelicals be clearly not take this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there be plenty of other example can you reconcile this i claim that there be *no* absolute i think there be very few though and determine absolute be difficult but you be claim that all of scripture be absolute how can you determine absolute derive from scripture when you agree how to interpret the scripture very difficult to see how you can claim something which be base on your own *interpretation* be absolute do you deny that your own background education prejudice etc come into play when you read the bible and determine how to interpret a passsage do you deny that you in fact interpret'
b"here be some material by michael davy on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular he write it around 1990. the first part of the two-part article be on the scandalous activity of archbishop weakland in this country but i cut all that and i par down the rest to what be relevant joe buehler ... schism and disobedience accord to st. thomas aquinas schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the member of the church united to him on first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop a discuss above he must be in a state of objective schism a he have refuse to submit to the pope on a very grave matter involve his supreme power of jurisdiction however standard catholic textbook of theology make it clear that while all schism involve disobedience not all act of disobedience be schismatic if this be so a be note at the begin of this article it would mean that the number of american bishop who be not schismatic would not reach double figure the distinction between disobedience and schism be make very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique the article be by father yves congar who be certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre he explains that schism and disobedience be so similar that they be often confuse father congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church for example luther 's rejection of the papacy father congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance do not constitute schism but disobedience the catholic encyclopedia explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend `` to sever himself from the church a far a in him lie '' it add that `` not every disobedience be schism in order to posse this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superior a denial of their divine right to command `` not only do mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the pope 's authority and his intention of never break away from rome the archbishop make his attitude clear in the july/august 1989 issue of 30 day `` we pray for the pope every day nothing have change with the consecration last june 30. we be not sedevacantists we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church we even say that he be a heretical pope we only say that his modernist action favor heresy '' ... intrinsically schismatic the principal argument use by those claim that mgr lefebvre be in schism be that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate be an intrinsically schismatic act a bishop who carry out such a consecration it be claimed becomes ipso facto a schismatic this be not true if such a consecration be an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involve the penalty of excommunication in the 1917 code of canon law the offence be punish only by suspension see canon 2370 of the 1917 code pope pius xii have raise the penalty to excommunication a a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishop differ radically from the consecration carry out by mgr lefebvre a the profess intention be to repudiate the authority of the pope that be to deny that he have the right to govern the church and the illicitly consecrate chinese bishop be give a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishop he have consecrate claim that they have power of jurisdiction they have be consecrate solely for the purpose of ensure the survival of the society by carry out ordination and also to perform confirmation i do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration of bishop without a papal mandate be far more serious matter than the ordination of priest a it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflict the church could not be more grave and that grave measure be need in response it appear to be take for grant by most of the archbishop 's critic that he be excommunicate for the offense of schism and the vatican have certainly be guilty of foster this impression there be not so much a a modicum of truth in this allegation the new code of canon law include a section begin with canon 1364 entitle '' penalty for specific offense '' de poenis in singula dictum the first part deal with `` offense against religion and the unity of the church '' de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem canon 1364 deal with the offense of schism which be evidently together with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offense against the unity of the church but the archbishop be not excommunicate under the term of this canon or indeed under any canon involve an offense against religion or the unity of the church the canon cite in his excommunication come from the third section of `` penalty for specific offense '' which be entitle `` usurpation of ecclesial function and offense in their exercise '' de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis the canon in question be canon 1382 which read `` a bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserve to the holy see '' the scandalous attempt to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism be then contrary to both truth and charity a comparable smear under civil a oppose to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involve massive damage an accurate parallel would be to state that a man convict of manslaughter have be convict of first degree murder i must stress that what i have write here be not the dubious opinion of layman unversed in the intricacy of canon law canon lawyer without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiate the charge of schism make against him a totally untenable father patrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris note in the 4 july 1988 issue of valeurs actuelles that a i have just explain mgr lefebvre be not excommunicate for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function he add that it be not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrate bishop it be this usurpation of the power of the sovereign pontiff which prof the intention of establish a parallel church cardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law comment on the consecration in the 10 july 1988 issue of la repubblica it would be hard to the act of consecrate a bishop without a papal mandate be not in itself a schismatic act in fact the code that deal with offense be divide into two section one deal with offense against religion and the unity of the church and these be apostasy schism and heresy consecrate a bishop with a pontifical mandate be on the contrary an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry for example in the case of the consecration carry out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in 1976 and 1983 although the archbishop be excommunicate he be not consider to have commit a schismatic act because there be no intention of a breach with the church ... it be not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrate bishop without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre have the least intent of establish a schismatic church he be not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic the archbishop considers correctly that the the church be undergo it bad crisis since the arian heresy and that for the good of the church it be necessary for him to consecrate the four bishop to ensure the future of his society canon law provide for just such a situation and even if one believe that the future of the society could have be guaranteed without these consecration the fact that the archbishop believe sincerely that it could not mean a canon law state clearly that he have not incur excommunication furthermore while the vatican allows such prelate a archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it can not expect catholic to pay the least attention to it sanction against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life have be devote to the service of the church and the salvation of soul dr. eric m. de saventhem president of the international una voce association be one of the best inform layman in the church and he know the archbishop intimately dr. de saventhem like myself have no great desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop 's lifetime a quotation from a statement by dr. de saventhem which be publish in the 15 february 1989 remnant merit careful study"
