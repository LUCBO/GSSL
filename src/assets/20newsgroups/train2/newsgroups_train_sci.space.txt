 any lunar satellite need fuel to do regular orbit correction and when it fuel run out it will crash within month the orbit of the apollo motherships change noticeably during lunar mission last only a few day it be  possible  that there be stable orbit here and there    the moon  s gravitational field be poorly mapped    but we know of none perturbation from sun and earth be relatively minor issue at low altitude the big problem be that the moon  s own gravitational field be quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the moon
 glad to see griffin be spending his time on engineering rather than on ritual purification of the language pity he get stuck with the turkey rather than one of the sensible option
 in spite of my great respect for the people you speak of i think their cost estimate be a bit over optimistic if nothing else a work ssto be at least a complex a a large airliner and have a small experience base it therefore seem that ssto development should cost at least a much a a typical airliner development that put it in the 3g to 5g range true it and the contest would result in a much large market but i think it would be enough to attract the investor give the risk involve if you could gurantee the ssto cost and gurantee that it capture 100 of the available launch market then i think you could do it allen
 one of the early jet fighter have these i also think the german do some work on these in wwii a lot of this be also do by the military     the first microwave land system from wwii too egad disagree with mary shafer
 i just get out of the army go signal corp or intelligence photointelligence interpretation if you go ada you might get to play with rocket but space will look pretty far away dug in the mud next to a grunt protect the foward troop from low fly object good luck

 allen sometimes i think ok  and sometimes you tend to rashly leap into make statement without think them out wan na guess which today need to launch hlvs to send up large amount of stuff do you know of a private titan pad
 assume that the low cost delivery system have to be a separate project but why if you be spending hundred of million of dollar in hope of win a billion dollar prize it be  cheaper  to develop your own launch system charge it entire development cost against your contest entry than to try to do it with exist launcher no other demand be necessary assume that go to take a decade to build a new launch system but why the saturn v take less than six year depend on exactly when you date it start pegasus take about three from project start to first flight before sdio chickened out on orbital development the target date for an orbital dc y flight be 1996  if you really want speed consider that the first prototype of the thor missile still in service a the core of the delta launcher ship to the usaf less than 18 month after the development go ahead
 this activity be regularly report in ron  s interest post could someone explain what the command loss timer be thanks alan
 also remember that every dollar spent keep one spacecraft in safe mode probably a spin stabilized sun pointing orientation be a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft in order to turn the spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the ops guy will be available or you need to retrain a new team have say that there be some spacecraft that do what you have propose many of the operational satellite goddard fly like the tiro noaa series require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set extra which get replace on orbit be power into a    standby    mode for use in an emergency in that case however the same ops team be still require to fly the operational bird so the standby maintenance be relatively cheap finally pat  s explanation some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control be also right on the mark i suggest a spin  stabilize control mode because it would require little power or maintenance but it still might require some momentum dump from time to time in the end it  is  a political decision since the difference be money but there be some technical rationale behind the decision
 how about transfer control to a non profit organisation that be able to accept donation to keep craft operational
 i have two book both nasa special publication on the voyager mission one be title    voyage to jupiter    the other    voyage to saturn    these be excellent book put together after the encounter with each planet the question be do nasa ever put together a similar book for either the uranus encounter or neptune if so what sp number be it and where can it be obtain if not why they
 i miss the presentation give in the morning session when shea give his    ramble and almost inaudible    presentation but i do attend the afternoon session the meeting be in a small conference room the speaker be wire with a mike and there be microphone on the table for the panel member to use peon like me sat in a foyer outside the conference room and watch the presentation on close circuit tv in general the sound system be fair to poor and some of the other speaker like the committee member from the italian space agency also be    almost inaudible    shea    lead the formal presentation    in the sense of run or guide the presentation he even attend the afternoon session vest ran the show president of mit the chair of the advisory panel
 i think you would lose your money julius be actually rather tall for a roman he do go on record a favour small soldier though thought they be tougher and have more gut he be probably right if you think about it a for napoleon remember that the french avergae be just about 5 foot and that height be relative do he really have a complex obspace we have all see the burning candle from high school that go out and relights if there be a large hot body place in space but in an atmosphere exactly how do it heat the surroundings diffusion only joseph askew
 this might a real wierd idea or maybe not   i have see where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then dry and make hard wall     why not do the same thing for a space station   fly up the dock ring and baloon material and such blow up the baloons spin then around i know a problem in micro gravity let them dry cure harden and cut a hole for the docking attaching ring and bingo a space station   of course the ballons would have to be foil cover or someother radiation protective covering heat shield and the material use to make the wals would have to meet the out gas and other spec or atleast the paint covering of the inner wall would have to be human safe   maybe a special congrete or maybe the same material a make caplets but with some change saw where someone instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture get a mix that be just a strong a congret but easy to carry around and such   sorry for any spell error i miss school today   grin    why musta space station be so difficult why must we have girder why be confine to earth base idea let think new idea after all space be not earth why be limited by earth base idea
 that would not explain why widely separate detector such a on ulysses and pvo and ginga et al  would see a burst at the same time in fact be  fore batse have this widely separate    interplanetary network    be the only sure way to locate a random burst with only one detector one can not locate a burst except to say    somewhere in the field of view     with two detector one can use the time that the burst be see in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky with three detector one get intersect annulus give two possible location if one of these location be impossible because say the earth block that part of the sky voila you have an error box batse by have 8 detector of it own can do it own location determination but only to within about 3 degree would someone at gsfc like david like to comment on the current state of location determination have inde  pendent sighting by other detector help drive down the uncertainty you do touch on something that you mean to though some believe in a reference that i have somewhere that absorption like feature see in a fraction of grbs can actually be cause by the detector it would be a mean nasty god though that would have a nai crystal act like a 10 12 gauss neutron star     but this be get too far afield
 the command loss timer be a timer that do just what it name say it indicates to the probe that it have lose it data link for receive command upon expiration of the command loss timer i believe the probe start a  search for earth sequence involve antenna point and attitude change which consume fuel to try to reestablish communication no ops be sent periodically through those period when there be no real command to be sent just so the probe know that we forgotten about it hope clear enough to be comprehensible       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden

 i be sure mary or henry can describe this more aptly then me but here be how i understand it at speed near supersonic the wind behaves like a fluid pipe it becomes incompressible so wind have to bend away from the wing edge a the wing thickens the more the pipe bend if they have no place to go they begin to stall and force compression steal power from the vehicle high drag if you squeeze the fuselage so that these pipe have aplace to bend into then drag be reduce essentially teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all area of the fuselage that be where the wing be subtract teh cross sectional area of the wing from the fuselage
 ah there  s the rub and a catch 22 to boot for the purpose of a contest probably not compete if n you afford the ride to get there and although low price delivery system might be doable without demand it doubtful that anyone will develop a new system course if a low price system exist there might be demand     i wonder if there might be some way of structure a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery system the accounting method would probably be the hardest to work out for example would you allow rockwell to  loan you the engine and so forth     this depends on the how soon the new launch system come on line in other word perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology life support navigation etc could be developed prior to a low cost launch system you want to use the expensive stuff forever but hate to see folk wait to do anything until a low cost mac oops i mean launch system come on line i guess simplify this to say that  waste be a slippery concept if your goal be man lunar exploration in the next 5 year then perhaps it not  wasted money if your goal be to explore the moon for under 500 million then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so craig
 sorry for ask a question not entirely base on the technical aspect of space but i find the answer on the faq currently in the uk which make see a space shuttle launch a little difficult        however i have be select to be an exchange student at louisiana state uni from august and i be absolutely determine to get to see a space shuttle launch sometime during the year at which i will be in america i hear there  s a bit of a long mail list so if someone can tell me how to get ticket and where to get them from then please e mail me thanks very much for your patience     and if anyone else want to know tell me and i  ll summarize for you just to save all those poor people who have to pay for their link

 reading from a amoco performance product data sheet their erl 1906 resin with t40 carbon fiber reinforcement have a compressive strength of 280 000 psi it have a density of 0 058 lb cu in therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself be 4 8 million inch or 400 000 ft or 75 statute mile now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss type or guy wire or both and will be use below the crush strength let u assume that we will operate at 40 of the theoretical strength this give a work height of 30 mile for a constant section column a constant section column be not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a taper of the cross section a you go up for example let u say you have a 280 000 pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in calculation this require 2 5 square inch of column cross sectional area to support the weight the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9 200 lb so at 1 mile below the payload the total load be now 289 200 lb a 3 3 increase the next mile of structure must be 3 3 thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom we can see from this that there be no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limit base on how much composite we can afford to by at 40 lb and how much load you need to support on the ground for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support let u arbitrarily choose 1 billion a the limit in costruction cost with this we can afford perhaps 10 000 000 lb of composite assume our finish structure cost 100 lb the 40 lb figure be just for material cost then we have a tower payload mass ratio of 35 7 1  at a 3 3 mass ratio per mile the tower height becomes 111 mile this be clearly above the significant atmosphere a rocket launch from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and g losses will be almost eliminate g losses be the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity thus they represent waste thrust together with drag rocket start from the ground have a 15 velocity penalty to contend with this analysis be simplify in that it do not consider wind load these will require more structural support over the first 15 mile of height above that the air pressure drop to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor dani eder
 archive name space astronaut last modified date 93 04 01 14 39 02 how to become an astronaut first the short form author by henry spencer then an official nasa announcement q  how do i become an astronaut a  we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corp pay passenger be not professional cosmonaut and the other nation have so few astronaut and fly even few that well off hop to win a lottery become a shuttle pilot require lot of fast jet experience which mean a military fly career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle    mission specialist    if you a u citizen become one that be a must after that the crucial thing to remember be that the demand for such job vastly exceeds the supply nasa  s problem be not find qualify people but thin the lineup down to manageable length it be not enough to be qualify you must avoid be  dis qualified for any reason many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d  specialize in something that involves get your hand dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer program entirely it will be do from the ground for the fore  seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seem to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody know what sudden pressure change would do to rked eye and long term effect be poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknown if you can pas a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you your chance be poor practise public speak and be conservative and conformist in appearance and action get a tough sell job ahead try to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you be well than hundred of other applicant and also that you will be a credit to nasa after you be hire public relation be a significant part of the job and nasa  s image be very prim and proper the image you want be squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get a pilot  s license and make fly your number one hobby experienced pilot be know to be favor even for non pilot job work for nasa of 45 astronaut select between 1984 and 1988 43 be military or nasa employee and the remain two be a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job at nasa    take it    sometimes in the past this have meant    you do look interest but we want to know you a bit well first    think space they want highly motivate people so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation keep try many astronaut make it the first time nasa national aeronautics and space administration lyndon b  johnson space center houston texas announcement for

 other idea for old space craft be a navigation beacon and such   why not because to be any use a a nav point you need to know  exactly  where it be which mean you either nail it to something that move or you watch it all the time neither of which be possible on a deactivate spacecraft then you have to know exactly how far away from it you be this may or may not be possible with the hardware on board apart from which there be absolutely no need for navigation beacon
 oddly enough the smithsonian call the lindbergh year the golden age of flight i would call it the granite year reflect the primitive nature of it it be romantic swashbuckling daredevil    those dare young men in their fly machine    but in reality it suck death be a highly likely occurence and the environment blew ever see the early navy pressure suit they be modify dive suit you be ready to star in    plan 9 from outer space    radio and nav aid be a joke and engine ran on castor oil they picked and call aviator    men with iron stomach    and it due to vertigo oddly enough now we be in the golden age of flight i can hop the shuttle to ny for 90 buck now golden mercury gemini and apollo be romantic but let  s be honest pee in bag have plastic bag glue to your butt everytime you need a bowel movement living for day inside a vw bug romantic but not commercial the dc x point out a most likely new golden age an age where fat cigar smoking business men in loud polyester space suit will fill the sky with strip mall and use space ship lot hhhmmmmm maybe retract that golden age bit maybe it be well in the old day of course then have wally schirra tell his great grand child    in my day we walk on the moon every day mile no bus you kid get it soft
 i be reading popular science this morning and be surprised by an ad in the back i know that a lot of the ad in the back of p be fringe science or questionablely legal but this one really grabbed my attention it be from a company name    personal missle inc     or something like that anyhow the ad state that sell rocket that be up to 20 in length and engine of size    f    to    m    they also say that some rocket will reach 50 000 foot now aside from the obvious danger to any amateur rocketeer use one of these beast this illegal i imagine the faa allow people to shoot rocket up through the flight level of passenger plane not to even mention the problem of locate a rocket when it come down and no not go to even think of buying one not that crazy  paul    mine  ll do 50 000 foot and carry 50 pound of dynamite    dokas
 lindbergh  s flight take place in  27 not the thirty could you give example of privately fund one your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategy however the concept of a prize for a difficult goal be do for different reason i suspect not aware that mr orteig receive any significant economic benefit from lindbergh  s flight modern analogy such a the prize for a human power helicopter face similar argument there be little economic benefit in such a thing the advantage come in the new approach developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would a person who put up x billion for a moon base be much more likely to do it because they want to see it do than because they expect to make money off the deal

 what evidence indicates that gamma ray burster be very far away give the enormous power i be just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range my own pet theory be that fly saucer enter hyperspace but the reason i be ask be that most everyone assumes that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole i just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in

 i know someone have long talk about solar sail early this year and late last year  also about solar sail not sure who capture it if possible   i think it be one of the regular who have most or all the data i think i start the late round or the late last year round   but the topic have be around here off and on for a year or two
 what evidence indicates that gamma ray burster be very far away their distribution be very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speak indicates see an edge to the distribution give the enormous power i be just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range now in the good old day before gro data it be thought the gamma burster be neutron star in the galaxy it be expect that gro would confirm this by either show they be a local population within a few hundred light year or that they be in the galactic halo mechanism be not know but several plausible one exist also to be fair it be note that the _brightest_ burster be probably in the lmc suggest theorist might be wrong back then     a the sun be not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population be rule out completely at this stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then get large the mechanism of get n out that far becomes questionable and we should start to see for example the andromeda  s burster the data be consistent with either a oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum or it can be a cosmological distance hence isotropy and the edge be    the edge of the universe    if at cosmological distance you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star collide with another neutron star or black hole even then get the spectrum be very hard but conceivable if we know anything about physic at that level the burster be not due to quantum black hole or cosmic string wrong spectrum for one thing the situation be far complicate by recent claim that there be two class of source in the collide n actually probably fit relatively easily into the ns ns and ns bh collision scenario respectively my own pet theory be that fly saucer enter hyperspace but the reason i be ask be that most everyone assumes that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole i just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in if you can think of one remember to invite me to stockholm

 actually there be people who will tell you that it  would  be enough to do ssto development if do privately a a cut rate operation of course they may be over optimistic you can also assume that a work ssto would have other application that would help pay for it development cost be inclined to make the prize somewhat large but 1g might be enough

to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian system with it cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini be schedule for launch aboard a titan iv centaur in october of 1997  after gravity assist of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004  upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuver to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separate from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relay the probe data to earth for about 3 hour while the probe enters and traverse the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continue tour the saturnian system for three and a half year titan synchronous orbit trajectory will allow about 35 flybys of titan and target flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objective of the mission be threefold conduct detailed study of saturn  s atmosphere ring and magnetosphere conduct close up study of saturn s satellite and characterize titan  s atmosphere and surface one of the most intrigue aspect of titan be the possibility that it surface may be cover in part with lake of liquid hydrocarbon that result from photochemical process in it upper atmosphere these hydrocarbon condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan  s cloud and determine if there be liquid on the surface experiment aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical process that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission be name for jean dominique cassini 1625 1712 the first director of the paris observatory who discover several of saturn  s

 one consideration to remember be that if you turn it off now you may not be able to later this a case of reach over and flip a switch much of the spacecraft have to be work correctly to execute a    turn off    command successfully spacecraft do malfunction in their old age the big concern be not radio clutter from idle spacecraft but radio clutter from malfunction spacecraft that can no longer be turn off
 could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression a an aid sorta like the portable iron lung put some sort of flex tube around the  aquanauts chest cyclically compress it and it will push enough on the chest wall to support breathing have to trust your breather but in space you have to trust your suit anyway
 at one time there be speculation that the first spacewalk alexei leonov be a stag fake have any evidence to support or contradict this claim emerge be this claim perhaps another fevered cold war hallucination
 for an essay i be write about the space shuttle and a need for a well propulsion system through research i have found that it be rather clumsy i e all the checks tests before launch the safety hazard    sit on a hydrogen bomb    etc   if you have any beef about the current space shuttle program re propulsion please send me your idea thanks a lot
 here be some recent observation take by the hubble space telescope o the faint object spectrograph fo be use to make ultraviolet observation of both the planet pluto and it moon charon the peakups be successful the observation be execute a schedule and no problem be report o observation be make use the high speed photometer of the planet uranus during an occultation by a faint star in capricornus these observation will help in our understand of the planet s atmospheric radiative and dynamical process this event occur close to the last quarter moon and special arrangement have to be make to modify the lunar limit test to allow these observation the observation be currently be review and all the observation look okay
 how could this possibly be    environmental vandalism    when there be no    environment    to vandalize up there since the advertising    be just to help defray cost    certainly no surprise that    the taxpayer would bear most of the expense    sound like a good idea to me since the taxpayer would bear _all_ of the expense if they do the advertising great idea they should have do it long ago i believe that a mile long billboard would have any significant effect on the overall sky brightness venus be visible during the day but nobody complains about that besides in leo so it would only be visible during twilight when the sky be already bright and even if it would have some miniscule impact it would be only for a short time a it go zip across the sky no doubt people be always look for something to protest about so it would be no surprise well look on the er bright side imagine the look on the face of people in primitive tribe out in the middle of nowhere a they look up and see a can of budweiser fly across the sky      d
 sure contact the world space foundation list in the sci space frequently ask question file which i  ll excerpt world space foundation have be design and building a solar sail spacecraft for longer than any similar group many jpl employee lend their talent to this project wsf also provide partial funding for the palomar sky survey an extremely successful search for near earth asteroid publishes  foundation news  and  foundation astronautics notebook  each a quarterly 4 8 page newsletter contribute associate minimum of 15 year but more money always welcome to support project world space foundation post office box y south pasadena california 91301 wsf put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and nonfiction about solar sail  project solar sail  i think robert staehle david brin or arthur clarke may be list a editor also there be a nontechnical book on solar sail by louis friedman a technical one by a guy whose name escape me help me out josh and i would expect that greg matloff and eugene mallove have something to say about the subject in  the starflight handbook  a well a quite a few reference check the follow article in  journal of the british interplanetary society  v36 p  201 209 1983 v36 p  483 489 1983 v37 p  135 141 1984 v37 p  491 494 1984 v38 p  113 119 1984 v38 p  133 136 1984 can you guess that matloff visit fermilab and give me a bunch of reprint i just found the file and k  eric drexler  s paper    high performance solar sail and related reflect device    aiaa paper 79 1418 probably in a book call  space manufacturing  maybe the proceeding of the second conference on space manufacturing the 1979 one at any rate

 in my first post on this subject i threw out an idea of how to fund such a contest without delve to deep into the budget i mention grant mineral right to the winner my actual word be    mining right somebody point out quite correctly that such right be not anybody  s to grant although i imagine it would be a fait accompli situation for the winner so how about this give the win group i see one company or corp do it a 10 20 or 50 year moratorium on tax
 well pardon me for try to continue the discussion rather than just tug my forelock in dismay at have not consider actually try to recover the energy from this process which be at least try to go the  right way on the energy curve now where  did  i put those sackcloth and ash i be not and be not  pretending anything i be  so  pleased you be not surprised though note that i say it be perpetual motion or even that it sound like perpetual motion the phrase be    sound almost like perpetual motion    which i at least consider a somewhat different propposition than the one you elect to criticize perhaps i should beg your pardon for be  too  precise in my use of language i will believe that this process come even close to approach technological and economic feasibility give the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it a oppose to the cost of separate thing first and have a different  run for each actinide when i see them dump a few ton in one end and pull relatively clean material out the other once the cost technological risk etc  be take into account i still class this one with the idea of throw waste into the sun sure possible and the physic be well understood but be it really a reasonable approach and i still wonder at what sort of  burning rate you could get with something like this a oppose to what kind of energy you would really recover a oppose to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy recovery be we talk ounce pound or ton gram kilogram or metric ton for you si fan of material and be we talk day week month or year day week month or year for you si fan    hmmm still use a non decimated time scale i see       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden

 seem like a lot of trouble to go to it probably well to invest in newer launch system i think a big cost advantage for use russian system will last for very long maybe a few year lockheed would be the place to ask since you would probably have to buy the proton from them they market the proton world wide except russia they should know a lot about the possibility i heard them propose u launch so i assume they look into it and found it unprofitable yes     comparable to the zenit i suppose but since it look like nothing will be built there you might just a well pick any spot the message be to launch now while it cheap and while russia and kazakstan be still cooperate later the story may be different

 the sighting be apparently spurious there be no planet inside of the orbit of mercury the idea of vulcan come from the difference between mercury  s observe perihelion precession and the value it should have have accord to newtonian physic leverrier make an extensive set of observation and calculation during the mid 19th century and simon newcombe later improve on the observation and re calculated use leverrier  s system of equation now leverrier be one of the co discoverer of neptune and since he have predict it existence base on anomaly in the orbit of uranus his inclination be to believe the same sort of thing be afoot with mercury but ala  twere not so mercury  s perihelion precesses at the rate it do because the space where it resides near the sun be significantly curve due to the sun  s mass this explanation have to wait until 1915 and albert einstein  s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of move body commonly call special relativity with reimanian geometry the result be the general theory of relativity and one of most noteworthy strength be that it account for the precession of mercury  s perihelion almost exactly exactly if you use newcomb s number rather than leverrier  s of course not everybody believe einstein and fine but subsequent effort to find any planet closer to the sun than mercury use radar have be fruitless  bill gawne    forgive him he be a barbarian who think the custom of his tribe be the law of the universe    g  j  caesar
 i attend a colloquium at goddard last fall where the head of the operation section of nasa be talk about what future mission be go to be fund i remember his name or title off hand and i have discard the colloquium announcement in any case he be ask about that very matter    why we spend a few million more to keep instrument that we already have in place go    his responce be that there be only so many available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a cobe magellan hubble etc be 5 10 year minumum if he spent all that could be spent on use current instrument in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future project if he do that sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular however start a few year after he have retire he would become one of the great villans ever see in the space community for not funding the early stage of the next generation of instrument just a he have benefit from his predicessor  s funding choice he owe it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep develop new mission even at the expense of cut off some instrument before the last drop of possible science have be wrung out of them

 here be a way to get the commericial company into space and mineral exploration basically get the eci freaks to make it so hard to get the mineral on earth   you think this be crazy well in a way it be but in a way it be reality there be a billin the congress to do just that   basically to make it so expensive to mine mineral in the u unless you can by off the inspector or tax collectors   ascially what i understand from talk to a few miner friend of mine that they the congress propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine versus the adjust income also the state government have there normal tax so by the time you get do pay for material worker and other expense you can owe more than what you make basically if you make a 1000 00 and spend 500  ofor expense you can owe 600 00 in federal taxes   bascially it be drive the miner off the land   and the only peopel who benefit be the eco freaks   basically to get back to my begin statement be space be the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco freaks or the protectionist   such fun we have in these interest times
 whatabout school university rich individual around 250 people in the uk have more than 10 million dollar each i reecieved mail from people who claimed they might get a person into space for 500 per pound send a skinny person into space and split the rest of the money among the ground crew agree i volunteer for any uk attempt but one clause no launch method which be clearly dangerous to the environment ours or someone else  s no usage of material from area of planetary importance yes we should  do  this rather than talk about it lobby people the major problem with the space programme be all talk paperwork and no action

 ssf be up for redesign again let  s do it right this time let  s step back and consider the functionality we want 1 microgravity vacuum process research 2 life science research adaptation to space 3 spacecraft maintenence the old nasa approach explified by shuttle and ssf so far be to centralize functionality these project fail to meet their target by a wide margin the military and commercial user take most of their payload off shuttle after waste much effort to tie their payload to it and ssf have crumble into disorganization and miscommunication over 50 billion have be spent on these two project with no reduction in launch cost and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization meanwhile military and commercial user have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation firstly different function be broken down into different constellation place in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the gps navstar constellation in 12 hour orbit comsats in clarke and molniya orbit etc secondly the task be distribute amongst several spacecraft in a constellation provide for redundancy and full coverage where need ssf  s 3 main function require quite different environment and be also prime candidate for constellization 1 we have the making of a microgravity constellation now comet and mir for long duration flight shuttle spacelab for short duration flight the best strategy for this area be inexpensive incremental improvement installation of u s  facility on mir shuttle mir linkup and transition from shuttle spacelab to a much less expensive ssto spacehab comet or ssto sif comet we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interest space environment eg the high radiation van allen belt or gas plasma gradient in comet tail the comet system can be much more easily retrofit for these task where a station be too large to affordably launch beyond leo 2 we need to study life science not just in microgravity but also in lunar and martian gravity and in the radiation environment of deep space instead of the protect shelter of leo this be a very long term low priority project since astronaut will have little practical use in the space program until cost come down order of magnitude furthermore use astronaut severely restricts the scope of the investigation and the sample size so i propose labratsat a constellation tether bolo satellite that test out various level of gravity in super van allen belt orbit that be representative of the radiation environment encounter on earth moon earth mars earth asteroid etc trip the miniaturize life support machinery might be operate real time from earth thru a vr interface after several orbital mission have be flown follow on can act a ldefs on the lunar and martian surface test out the actual environment at low cost before billion be spent on astronaut 3 by far the large market for spacecraft service be in clarke orbit i propose a fleet of small teleoperated robot and small test satellite on which ground engineer can practice their skill once in place robot can pry stuck solar array and antenna attach solar battery power pack inject fuel etc once the fleet be work it can be spun off to commercial company s who can work with the comsat company to develop comsat replaceable module standard by apply the successful constellation strategy and get rid of the fail centralize strategy of sts and old ssf we have radically improve the capability of the program while greatly cut it cost for a fraction of ssf  s pricetag we can fix satellite where the satellite be we can study life  s adaptation to a much large more representative variety of space environment and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and if need in special purpose orbit n b  we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration a well greatly cut it cost and increase it functionality mar network and artemis be two good example of this more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plant on mar that can be use to fuel planet wide rover ballistic hopper prospect and sample return the descendant of labratsat  s technology can be use a a mar surface ldef and to test out closed ecology greenhouse on mar at low cost

 why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cut for example why magellan just be told to go into a    safe    mode and stay bobbing about venus in a low power use mode and if maybe in a few year if funding get restore after the economy get well hopefully it could be turn on again for that matter why exactly be the apollo lunar experiment    turn off    rather than just    safed    be it political i e a along a they could be use someone would keep bugging congress for fund turn them off keep them pesky scientist out of the bureaucrat  s hair     heard the argument that an active but    uncontrolled    spacecraft cause    radio noise    i find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly design    safe    mode this safe mode could be a program routine which cause the spacecraft to go to least fuel use orientation and once a week month year whatever attempt a signal lock on earth at that time if funding have be restore the mission can continue if no signal be recieved the spacecraft go back to the safe mode for another time period a we would know when the spacecraft be go to try to contact earth we could be prepared if necessary a another a spacecraft could do at the attempt contact be beam store data towards earth if someone can receive it great if not so lose and no big deal by make the time and signal location generally know perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if not willing to contact the spacecraft i see this a be particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and be in or be go to place which be otherwise unaccessible jupiter saturn orbit exit the solar system etc perhaps those design future spacecraft cassini pluto flyby etc should consider design in a    pause    mode in case their spacecraft get the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission perhaps mar observer and galilleo could have some kind of routine write in for the post mission    drift    phase so any hole in all this
 i like option c of the new space station design   it need some work but it be simple and elegant   it about time someone get into simple construction versus overly complex     basically just strap some rocket and a nose cone on the habitat and go for it   might be an idea for a moon mars base to

 excerpt from post on this topic see satellite at midnight not only in twilight o now my comment like to add that some of the    protest    do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution level be acceptable for research activity by professional astronomer some of what i would complain about be root in aesthetic many reader may never have know a time where the heaven be pristine sacred unsullied by the action of human the space between the star a profoundly black a an abyss can be with full horizon and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time none of which have any connection with the petty matter of man any light be supply solely by nature uncorruptable by men whole religion be base on mortal man somehow get up there and become immortal a the star whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife the space age change all that the effect of the first sputnik and echo etc on this view could only happen once to see a light cross the night sky and know it be put there by u puny people be still impressive and the sense of size one get by assimilate the scale involve be also awesome even if the few hundred or thousand of mile involve be still dwarfed by the rest of the universe but there be still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky yes i know aircraft be almost always in sight i have to live in a very populate area 6 mile from an international airport currently where light pollution on the ground be ghastly the impact of human be so extreme here virtually no place exists that have not be shape sculpt modify trash or whip into shape by the hand of man in some place the only life form large than bacteria be human cockroach and squirrel or rat i visit some friend up in the appalacian mountain one weekend    get away from it all    pave road indoor plumbing mall     and it felt good for a while then i quickly notice the hollow be directly under the main flight path into dulles 60 80 mile to the east their  security light help matter much either but heard the artic wilderness get lot of high air traffic so i know the sky be rarely perfect but there be still this desire to see a place that man foul in some way i mean they  ve be try this forever like concern tesla  s idea to banish night wow i watch commercial television but i can imagine just how disgust beer truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisement would be if see up so high if ya get ta make a buck on it display product in heaven at least consider the reaction from those for whom the sky be a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life to be open about this though i have here my listing of the passage of hst in the even sky for this weekend tonight friday at 8 25 p m  edt it will reach an altitude of 20 1 degree on the local meridian from baltimore vicinity i  ll be try to see it if i can it _is_ my mealticket after all so i suppose i could be call an elitist for support this intrusion on the night sky while complain about billboard propose by others be that a it may i think my point about a desire for beauty be valid even if it ever be perfectly achieve

 could it be public missile inc in michigan from the description of ad here it sound like talk about    high power rocketry    an outgrowth of model rocketry this hobby us non metallic structural compoments and commerically manufacture engine range in impulse classification from g to p  the hobby have be flourish from early 1980s and be become increase popular technically this be not consider amateur rocketry any rocket with a liftoff weight great than 3 3 pound or use a total impulse of g or great require an faa waiver to launch typically a group of people get an faa waiver for specify period of time ie week weekend etc at a designate site and time and all of the launch be then cover under this    blanket waiver    there be also a    high power safety code    which designates more specific rule such a launch field size etc finally in order to purchase any of the large class b rocket motor you need to certify through either the national association of rocketry or tripoli rocketry association certification procedure require a demonstarted handle and    safe    flight at a total impulse level for more information watch rec models rockets newsgroup
 actually the reboost will probably be do last so that there be a fuel reserve during the evas in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that but yes get the idea    the reboost be do by take the whole shuttle up somebody have to build that thruster module not an off the shelf item nor be it a trivial piece of hardware since it have to include attitude control hst  s own be not strong enough to compensate for thing like thruster imbalance guidance there be no provision to feed gyro data from hst  s own gyro to an external device and separation you want it left attach afterward if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid be open again you also get to worry about whether the lid be go to open after the reboost be do and hst be inaccessible to the shuttle the lid stay close for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thruster and the like the original plan be to use the orbital maneuvering vehicle to do the reboost the omv be plan to be a sort of small space tug well suit to precisely this sort of job unfortunately it be cost a lot to develop and the list of definitely known application be relatively short so it get cancel

 well i guess left wonder just who all the  light fascists  think  they  be yes i understand the issue i even particularly care for the idea but be i the only one that find the sort of overreaction above just a  little  questionable you must find thing like the moon  really  obnoxious in their pollution a few question for those froth at the mouth to ask themselves 1 how long be this thing suppose to stay up sound like it would have a  huge  drag area not a lot of mass and be in a fairly low orbit 2 just what orbital parameter be we talk about here what real impact be we talk about really how many optical astronomer be  really  go to be impact 3 which be more important add a few extra day of  seeing for very few optical astronomer or get the data the sensor be suppose to return along with the data for large inflatables and the potential there for an inflatable space station the choice would seem to be one or the other since the advertising be be use to help fund this thing 4 if your answer to 3 above be    the astronomer    then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the to my mind more important research data that would be gain by this without spending any more of my money to do it in other word put up or shut up probably so just not sure we agree about who the  stupid be yeah me too       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden
 forward from john spencer spencer lowell edu there will be two eclipse of iapetus by saturn and it ring in may and july please spread the word here  s some information about the event and then a couple of message from jay goguen of jpl appeal for thermal observation of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal property of iapetus he might also have some money available     john spencer 1993 04 21 iapetus will be eclipse by the shadow of saturn  s ring and saturn itself on 1993 05 01 02 18 27 13 43 ut and again on 1993 07 20 21 21 16 09 38 ut timing be a follow 1993 may 1 2 a ring ingres 18 27 egress 19 30 b ring ingres 19 51 egress 21 42 c ring egress 23 00 saturn ingres 23 59 egress 10 02 b ring ingres 10 28 egress 12 19 a ring ingres 12 40 egress 13 43 1993 july 20 21 saturn ingres 21 16 egress 05 08 a ring ingres 05 13 grazing egress 09 38 time could be 30 minute later accord to an alternate ephemeris and photometric observation be important for refining iapetus  orbit because the sun  s size project on the ring a see from iapetus be 3100 km unlikely that we will learn anything new about the ring themselves from the observation see soma 1992 astronomy and astrophysics 265 l21 l24 for more detail thanks to andy odell of northern arizona university for bring the event to my attention thermal observation to me the interest thing to do would be thermal ir of the 20 july disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia etc unfortunately the 21 30 ut of this event render it inaccessible except from russia even from calar alto saturn be rise through 3 airmasses at 23 00 ut do you know anyone in russia or ukraine with a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation look for something to do be willing to make a personal grant of 100 for the data jay and again please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet disappearance to do so at thermal wavelength my impression would be that not an easy observation iapetus will be faint and get fainter in eclipse so need a big telescope a good ir telescope and reasonable 10 20 um instrumentation i think that combination be widely available at the longitude that be well place for observation we need sofia for this one one possibility would be the ir telescope in india but only a 1 2 m  jay
 the gravity maneuvering that be use be to exploit  fuzzy region these be described by the inventor a exploit the second order perturbation in a three body system the probe be launch into this region for the earth moon sun system where the perturbation affected it in such a way a to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditure of fuel to slow down the idea be that  natural object sometimes get capture without expend fuel just find the trajectory that make it possible    the originator of the technique say that nasa interested but that japan be because their probe be small and hold a lot of fuel for deceleration this from an issue of  science news or  the planetary report i believe about 2 month ago
 okay let get the record straight on the livermore gas gun the project manager be dr  john hunter and he work for the laser group at livermore what you may ask do gas gun have to do with laser nothing really but the gun be physically locate across the road from the free electron laser building and the fel building have a heavily shield control room thick wall from which the gun firing be control so i suspect that the office he work for be an administrative convenience i visit hunter at the begin of feb  and we tour the gun at the time i be work on gas gun r d at boeing where i work but i be now do other thing help to save the space station the gun us a methane air mixture which be burn in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch id i e it look like a pipe the chamber hold a 1 ton piston which be propel at several hundred m s down the chamber on the other side of the piston be hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome ten of atmosphere the piston compress and heat the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm rupture at around 50 000 psi the barrel of the gun be about 100 foot long and have a 4 inch bore it be mount at right angle to the chamber i e they intersect this be do so that in the future the barrel could be raise and the gun fire into the air without have to move the large and heavier chamber the projectile be use in test be a 5 kg cylinder of lexan plastic 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long all of the acceleration come from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50 000 psi downwards until the projectile leaf the barrel the barrel be evacuate and the end be seal with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than saran wrap the plastic be blown off by the small amount of residual air trap in the barrel ahead of the projectile the gun be fire into a bunker fill with sandbag and plastic water jug in the early test fragment of the plastic projectile be found at the high speed in later test the projectile vaporizes the test be into a bunker because the livermore test range be about 3 mile across and the projectile would go 100 200 km if fire for maximum range the intent be to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the test be complete where they can fire into the pacific ocean and use the track radar at vafb to follow the projectile the design goal of the gun be to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km s half of orbital speed so far they have reach 2 km s and the gun be currently down for repair a on the last test they blew a seal and damage some of the hardware i think it have to do with the methane air more detonate than burning but i have a chance to talk to hunter directly on this there be people wait to test scramjet component in this gun by fire then out of the gun into the air at mach 12  4 km s since the most you can get in wind tunnel be mach 8  this gun cost about 4 million to develop and be basically a proof of concept for a big gun capable of fire useful  size payload into space this would require on the order of 100 kg projectile which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit dani eder

 their hiten engineering test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric earth orbit do lunar flybys and then be insert into lunar orbit use some very tricky gravity assist like maneuvering this meant that it would crash on the moon eventually since there be no such thing a a stable lunar orbit a far a anyone know and i believe i recall hearing recently that it be about to happen

 the general chairman be paul bialla who be some official of general dynamic the emphasis seem to be on a scaled down fast plan to put  people  on the moon in an impoverish spaceflight funding climate think it would be a golden opportunity to do lot of precusor work for modest money use an agressive series of robot spacecraft but there  s not a hint of this in the brochure not hang out with the right people apparently
 the commercial us of a transportation system between already settled  and civilized area be obvious spaceflight be not in this position the correct analogy be not with aviation of the  30  s but the long transocean voyage of the age of discovery it require gov t to fund these a long a something be know about the potential for profit at the destination in practice some be gov t fund some be private but there be no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff i be sure that a thrive spaceflight industry will eventually develop and large number of people will live and work off earth but if you ask me for specific justification other than the increase resource base i give them we just know enough the launch rate demand by exist space industry be just too low to bring cost down much and we be very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industry will be when they will practical how much will have to be invest to start them etc

 the follow be my thought on a meeting that i hugh kelso and bob lilly have with an aide of sen  patty murray we be there to discus ssto and commercial space this be how it go     after receive a packet contain a presentation on the benifits of ssto i call and try to schedule a meeting with our local senator d patty murray washington state i start ask for an hour and when i heard the gasp on the end of the phone i quickly back off to 1 2 an hour later in that conversation i learn that a standard appointment be 15 minute we get the standard bozo treatment that be we be call back by an aide who schedule a meeting with u in order to determine that we be not bozo and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to make sure that it be appropriate to take the senator time with that material well i get allocate 1 2 hour with sen  murray aide and we end up talk to him for 45 minute with u end the meeting and him still listen we cover a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit be dcx specific most of it be a single stage reusable vehicle primer there be another woman there who take copius quantity of note on every topic that we brought up but with murray be new we want to entrench ourselves a non corporate align i e not speak for boeing local citizen interentested in space so we spent a lot of time cover the benifits of low cost access to leo solar power satellite be a big focus here so we hit them a become feasible with low cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that we hit the tourism angle and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism paper with side note be that everyone who go into space and see the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after see the smog over l a  we hit on the benifits of study bone decalcification which be more pronounce in space and say that that have potential to lead to understand of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis we hit the education whereby kid get enthuse by space but a they get old and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually get there they go on to other field with low cost to orbit the chance they might get there someday would provide great incentive to hit the harder class need we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle we hit the low cost of satellite launch gps navigation personal communicator tellecommunications new service etc     job provide in those sector job provide building the thing balance of trade improvement etc   we mention that skypix would benifit from low launch cost we left the paper on what technology need to be invest in in order to make this even easy to do and he ask question on this point we end by tell her that we want her to be aware that effort be proceed in this area and that we want to make sure that the result from these effort be not lose much like condor or majellan and most importantly we ask that she help fund far effort along the line of lower the cost to leo in the middle we also give a little speal about the lunar resource data purchase act and the guy file it separately he be very interested in it he ask some question about it and seem like he want to jump on it and contact some of the people involve with it so something may actually happen immediatly there the last two thing we do be to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they could feel free to call u any time with question and if we know the answer that we would see to it that they question get to people who really do know the answer then finally we ask for an appointment with the senator herself he say that we would get on the list and he also say that know her this would be something that she would be very interested in although they do have a time problem get her schedule since she be only in the state 1 week out of 6 these day all in all we felt like we do a pretty good job

 two development have brought these type of activity back to the forefront in 1993  first in february the russian deployed a 20 m reflector from a progress vehicle after it have depart from the mir space station while this    banner    reflector be blank npo energia be very active in reporting that future banner reflector will be available to advertiser who could use a space  base video of their logo or ad print on the banner in a tv commercial a film from the mir the second development have be that space marketing inc the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft be now push the    environmental billboard    a laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory the    environmental billboard    be a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meter advertising be carry by a mylar reflective area deployed by the inflatable  frame to help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintain the billboard on orbit will carry    ozone reading sensor    to    continuously monitor the condition of the earth s delicate protective ozone layer    accord to mike lawson head of smi furthermore the inflatable billboard have reach it minimum exposure of 30 day it will be release to re enter the earth s atmosphere accord to imi    a the biodegradable material burn it will release ozone building component that will literally replenish the ozone layer    the remain spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it too re enters and burn up and    add to the ozone supply    this would not be a cheap advertisement cost at least several million of dollar exact cost be not available but smi estimate that market exposure would be 3 5x that of the people who watch the superbowl where a 30 second advertising  unit cost 600 000 since smi be locate in atlanta georgia it be be promote a be available in time for the opening of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta but back to brian  s question see above a for serious    if they can get 15 20 m or so my estimate of 5 10 for development cost and a flight unit plus 10 15 m for a launch then probably real they be claim to tailor the orbit to overfly specific location at specific time for optimum advertising impact so they probably piggy back upon someone else  s plan launch and will have to buy a dedicate launch a 10 15 m cost they need to raise right there and there will probably be some legal challenge to this a well note there be one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already while i think the legal challenge would win out and yes i be an amateur astronomer and no i really like the idea of this additional light pollution but i know of no prohibition of it     the legal challenge and court fight would probably remove any positive aspect of the advertising i can imagine several way to make the advertiser look like lout for do this    which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the space advertising advantage would you spend 15 m to look like an idiot and light pollution might not be too bad    if in a low enough orbit and it relies upon reflect light only it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn for maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just after dusk    minimize impact on astronomy since the time of bad see due to day night thermal turbulence it might still be a problem but perhaps there be way to mitigate this     a for have real funding    none that i can identify there be about 60 expression of interest make on the conestoga advertising opportunity but that include curious folk and be for only a 500 000 commitment i heard of any serious funding for this but sure they be shopping the venture around look for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more but i be confident there be no firm or pay customer at this time and if anybody want to cross post this to sci astro please be my guest i have post privilege to that area or at least i think i do                                                                                                        wale larrison space technology investor

 the hga all that reflective in the wavelength that might    cook the focal element    nor be it figure good on those scale    the problem be that the antenna _itself_ could not be expose to venus level sunlight l like icarus wing it melt i think it be glue and such a well a electronics that they be worried about thus it have to remain furl and the axis _always_ point near the sun so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the fold hga a large sunshade beneath the antenna shield the spacecraft bus

 hiya a very amuture astronomer in adelaide australia and today i heard some very interest and excite news from a local program on tv a i find anything on it on the news server i have post this however if it be old information tell me and ill sue the tv station for say they be  up to date also my news server could be slow so i only caught the end of the article so all the information on the topic be not know to me at the moment the news be of a small  psudo planet outside the orbit of pluto found in a hawiian obsevatory supposably  recently acording to the report it be meant to be about 150miles in diamater and a faily large distance from the pluto orbit it have a computer draw and the orbit distance from pluto be about the same a neptune to pluto when they be furthest apart this be all i found out about it oh it be call karna un officially can anyone give any more information to me on it thanx brendan woithe swoithe crackle aelmg adelaide edu au btw if this be old news do anyone know a good lawyer  8
  i love the idea of an inflatable 1 mile long sign     it will be a  really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt or even well a  westford needle come crash into it at 10 click a sec pageos and two echo balloon be inflate with a substance which expand in vacuum once inflate the substance be no longer need since there be nothing to cause the balloon to collapse this inflatable structure could suffer multiple hole with no disastrous deflation
 i would just like to point out that it be much easy to place an object at orbital altitude than it be to place it with orbital velocity for a target 300 km above the surface of earth you need a delta v of 2 5 km s assume that rocket with specific impulse of 300 second be easy to produce a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel oxidizer a small dispersal charge embed in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot depend on the nature of the structure would be the payload i be sure the whole project be well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community it sound like a good science fair project     reduction of light pollution through apply ballistics or it could be part of the challenge prize be discuss here 1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon 1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore ccd burner i wouldpledge 1000 for the first person to bring it down and i be sure there be at least 999 other astronomer nature lover or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise of course a gerald bull solution might be simpler either the solution gerald bull would apply    the use of a large caliber gun or the solution which be apply to gerald bull    the use of a small caliber gun
 would you mind post the response you get i be also interested and there may be others thanks
 i post this over in sci astro but it make it here thought you all would like my wonderful pithy commentary what you guy have never see the goodyear blimp pollute the daytime and nightime sky actually an oribital sign would only be visible near sunset and sunrise i believe so pollution at night would be minimal if it pay for space travel go for it those who like spatial billboard can then head for the pristine environment of jupiter  s moon
 i be at an interest seminar at work uk  s r a l space science dept on this subject specifically on a small scale solar sail propose a a student space project the guy give the talk be keen to generate interest in the project i  ll typein the handout he give out at the meeting here go the microlight solar sail                                     1  introduction the solar sail be a well established concept harness the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range in principle such a vehicle could explore the whole solar system with zero fuel consumption however it be more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize the pressure of sunlight be only about one kilogram per square kilometer deploy and control the large area of aluminize fabric which would be necessary to transport a  conventional type spacecraft be a daunt task this be why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft have actually be launch to date 2 design recent advance in microelectronics make possible a different concept a tiny sail just a few metre in diameter which could be control purely be electronics with no mechanical part several attitude control method be feasible for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cell varies accord to whether power be be drawn the key component of the craft will be a minute ccd camera developed at edinburgh university which can act a both attitude sensor and data gathering device solar cell provide  1 watt power for control and communication and a directional radio antenna etch onto the surface of the sail itself launch a a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few ten of thousand of dollar 3 missions the craft would be capable of some ambitious mission for example a it could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the apollo or amor group closeup picture could be transmit back to earth at a low bit rate b it could be steer into a lunar polar orbit previously unobserved area around the lunar pole could be view by angle the sail to reflect sunlight downwards polar crater whose base never receive sunlight could be image bright reflection would confirm that volatile such a water ice have become trap in these location immensely valuable information for set up a man lunar base btw c it could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus impact at low speed a thin wire probe attach to the craft cause it to rebound while capture a tiny sample be a sharp edged tube like perform a biopsy return to earth the sail act a an ideal re entry parachute load per unit area 20 gm m2 ensures that heat be reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature can not exceed  300 deg c  the material sample be recover enclose in a small insulate container contact colin jack tel 0865 200447 oxford mathematical design 131 high street oxford ox1 4dh england                                                 this guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or seek detail or anything and would be most happy to send you more information andy

 just read richard langley  s late    navstar gps constellation status    it state that the late satellite be place in orbit plane position c 3 there be already one satellite in that position i know that almost ten year since that satellite be launch but still in operation so why not use it until it go off why not instead place the new satellite at b 4 since that position be empty and by this measure have an almost complete gps constellation 23 out of 24  thomas                                                                                  ericsson telecom stockholm sweden

 this sound like another of ali abutaha  s 57 different    real cause    of the challenger accident a far a i know there have never be the slightest shred of evidence for a    harmonic resonance    have occur the windshear induced maneuvering probably  did  contribute to opening up the leak path in the srb joint again    it seem to have seal itself after the puff of smoke during liftoff    but the exist explanation of this and related event seem to account for the evidence adequately
 you think it would be well to e mail back to you that we read sci space so that you can count them and every server in the world do not have to get bw  d to death or instead you could possible cut and past all the sender into a single post and save on header bandwidth     not meaning to be take a a flame late and we have to work toward a demo     little punchy
 i think if there be to be a prize and such   there should be    class    such a the follow large corp  small corp company base on report earnings large government gnp and such small governemtn or political clout or gnp large organization planetary society and such small organization alot of small orgs   the organization thing would probably have to be non profit or liek of course this mean the prize might go up large get more or basically make the prize total purse 6 billion divide amngst the class winners   more fair there would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the event umpire and such and watch for safety violation or maybe not if peopel want to risk thier own life let them do it

 today new york time just write about a pact be negotiate between u and the russian to develope high temperature gas cool fission reactor use re cycled weapon grade plutonium from warhead stockpile the fuel will be pelletized in ceramic for safety and then after depletion will be sufficiently contaminate with by product to make extraction of the remain plutonium hazardous enough to deter re use apparently the project will be lead by general atomics of san diego with funding from the u government the pilot plant will be built and operate by the russian
 when i be at the texas star party a few year ago the sky be so dark that venus do indeed cause light pollution until it set even if the billboard be dark it could cause a problem imagine observe an object and halfway through your run your object be occult i would guess that most of the people state positive opinion be not fanatically serious observer it be so typical that the right of the minority be extinguish by the want of the majority no matter how ridiculous those want might be george krumins
 i believe the reason be that the lung diaphram get too tire to pump the liquid in and out and simply stop breathing after 2 3 minute so if your in the vehicle ready to go they well not put you on hold or else about it remember a liquid be several more time a dense a a gas by it very nature  10 i think depend on the gas and liquid comparision of course
    space station redesign leader say cost goal may be impossible    today 4 6 the washington post ran an article with the headline show above the article start with    a leader of the nasa team in charge of redesign the plan space station say yesterday the job be tough and may be impossible    o connor be quote say whether it be possible to cut cost that much and still provide for meaningful research    be a real question for me    o connor say    everything be fair game    include    drop or curtail exist contract with the aerospace industry chop management of the space station program at some nasa facility around the country work closely with the russian space station mir and use unmanned titan rocket to supplement the man space shuttle fleet    o connor say his team have review 30 design option so far and they be sort the serious candidate into three category base on cost the post say o connor described the design derive from the current ssf a a high cost option i believe kathy sawyer the post writer get confuse here i listen in on part of o connor  s briefing to the press on monday and in one part of the briefing o connor talk about how the white house want three option sort by cost low medium and high in another part of the briefing he discuss the three team he have form to look at three option ssf derivative larc modular buildup with bus 1 msfc and single launch core    wingless orbiter    jsc later in response to a reporter question i thought i heard o connor say the option base on a ssf redesign be a    moderate    cost option in between low high cost option not the    high cost    option a sawyer write the article go on to describe the other two option a    one feature module that could gradually be fit together in orbit similar to the russian mir the other be a core facility that could be deposit in orbit in a single launch like skylab that option would use exist hardware from the space shuttle the fuselage for example in it basic structure
 tonigth a tv journal here in brasil announce that an object beyond pluto  s orbit be found by an observatory at hawaii they name the object karla the program say the object a gaseous giant planet and should be compose by rock and ice can someone confirm these information could this object be a new planet or a kuiper object thanks in advance francisco

atmospheric model study of the space shuttle effect on the stratosphere involve three independent theoretical group and be organize by dr  michael prather nasa goddard institute for space study the three group involve michael prather and maria garcia nasa giss charlie jackman and anne douglas nasa goddard space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc  the effort be to look at the effect of the space shuttle and titan rocket on the stratosphere the follow be the estimate source of stratospheric chlorine industrial source 300 000 000 kilograms year natural source 75 000 000 kilograms year shuttle source 725 000 kilograms year the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttle and 6 titan rocket be launch yearly thus the launch would add less than 0 25 to the total stratospheric chlorine source the effect on ozone be minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decrease by 0 0065 this be much less than total ozone variability associate with volcanic activity and solar flare the influence of human made chlorine product on ozone be compute by atmospheric model calculation to be a 1 decrease in globally average ozone between 1980 and 1990  the influence of the space shuttle and titan rocket on the stratosphere be negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rocket would need to be increase by over a factor of a hundred

orbit you use the shuttle orbiter for mission beyond low earth orbit because it get there it be big and heavy and do not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tank furthermore it be not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight be thing like wing which be totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter be highly specialized for travel between earth  s surface and low orbit take it high be enormously costly and wasteful a much well approach would be to use shuttle subsystem to build a specialized high orbit spacecraft yet

 what would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 martin mariatta boeing mcdonell douglas general dynamic lockheed rockwell get together and form a consortium to study exactly what the market price pint be for building reusable launch vehicle and spending say 3million to do that recognize that most of the military requirement for launch vehicle be pull out of a hat somewhere say have the shuttle ever really use that 1200mi crossrange capability you get the idea figure out how many how often where to etc     then take this data and form a sematech type company bad example i know     but at least it an example     to develop between 3 and 5 craft design then to take all of those design and figure out exactly what the technology be and demonstrate those technology in order to eliminate design that be built today and let say that this portion again fund by the gov cost about 20 million and from here all of these company go their separate way with the intention of take all of the market data and the design data to wall street and say    i want to build this vehicle and here be the number that show 20 roi fund me     now many of you think that this be a joke but i have it on good authority that just this project be shape up in the background it seem that the aerospace company have learn that everyone yell similar but different thing end up in many program that do nothing much and get cancel nasp nls al dcy etc     they need to work more in the japaneese and european spirit of initial cooperation they have also learn that design requirement that be phony i e some general idea of what a space vehicle ought to be end up get chopped up in congress because it be not a real requirement any feedback

 in reference to the limit of acceleration with gun launch solid rocket a payload thiokol provide me with sample and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grain for high acceleration solid motor propellant usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix for example the space shuttle srbs be 16 percent aluminum the technique be to use a  foamed aluminum structure the structure look like the inverse of a set of bubble an i suspect some bubbling process be use to form it in other word if you make a bunch of bubble in molten aluminum then froze it this be what you get it form a strong network of effectively aluminum wire in all direction the remain solid fuel mix be infiltrate into the void and you get aluminum reinforced solid propellant the foamed aluminum make up about 6 percent of the total propellant so there be still aluminum particle in the bulk grain the major improvement be the high resistance to grain crack which be the principal failure mode for solid propellant dani eder

 oh gee a billion dollar that  d be just about enough to cover the cost of the feasability study happy happy joy joy
 announce that a reward of 1 billion would go to the first corporation who successfully keep at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year then see some of the inexpensive but not popular technology begin to be developed there  d be a different kind of space race then an advocate of this idea for funding space station work and i throw around the 1 billion figure for that    reward    i suggest that you increase the lunar reward to about 3 billion this would encourage private industry to invest in space which should be one of nasa  s primary goal    ken jenks nasa jsc gm2 space shuttle program office kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov 713 483 4368

the most up to date information on upcoming mission call 407 867 info 867 4636 at kennedy space center official nasa shuttle status report be post to sci space news frequently why do the shuttle roll just after liftoff the follow answer and translation be provide by ken jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov the    ascent guidance and flight control training manual    asc g c 2102    during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude be command until an i loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance be achieve then the tilt maneuver roll program orient the vehicle to a head down attitude require to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural load other advantage with this attitude be performance gain decrease abort maneuver complexity improve s band look angle and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver be also require to start gain downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage    this really be a good answer but couched in nasa jargon i  ll try to interpret 1 we wait until the shuttle clear the tower before roll 2 then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind cause by passage through the atmosphere the    relative wind    and the chord of the wing the imaginary line between the lead edge and the trail edge be a slightly negative angle    a negative q alpha    this cause a little bit of    downward    force toward the belly of the orbiter or the  z direction and this force    alleviates structural load    we have to be careful about those wing    about the most    delicate    part of the vehicle 3 the new attitude after the roll also allows u to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a high orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a high or low inclination than would be the case if we roll    performance gain    4 the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicate flight path if they have to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuver the return to launch site    decrease abort maneuver complexity    5 the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antenna to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antenna on the orbiter    improve s band look angle    6 the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which be a helpful but not mandatory part of pilot any fly machine 7 the new attitude orient the shuttle so that the body be more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allows the thrust from the engine to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity be a vector quantity make of both speed and direction the shuttle have to have a large horizontal component to it velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all begs the question    why the launch pad orient to give this nice attitude to begin with why do the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude    the answer be that the pad be leftover from the apollo day the shuttle straddle two flame trench    one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effect of this on any daytime launch the srm exhaust be dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust be fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the    top    orbiter side and the    bottom    external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure be all orient basically the same way they be for the saturn v  s a side note the saturn v  s also have a roll program ask me why    a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamic he add that the    roll maneuver    be really a maneuver in all three ax roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver be perform for the reason state the pitch component control load on the wing by keep the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component be use to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver be really express a a    quaternion    a grad level math concept for combine all three rotation matrix in one four element array how to receive the nasa tv channel nasa select nasa

 i hate to pour cold water on this but currently seawater extract uranium even use the new improve fiber absorber from japan be about 20 time more expensive than uranium on the spot market uranium be  very  cheap right now around 10 lb right now there be mine closing because they compete with place like cigar lake in canada where the ore be so rich they present safety hazard to the mine who work in shield vehicle plenty of other source for example uranium from phosphate processing would come on line before uranium reach 200 lb    demand and supply balance will collapse    be nonsense supply and demand always balance what change be the price be uranium go to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century not bloody likely new nuclear reactor be not be built at a sufficient rate uranium from seawater be interest but a long term project or a project that the japanese might justify on ground of self sufficiency

 george call a democracy the majority rule sorry if ytou like it i suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to dark sky the theory of government here be that the majority rule except in the nature of fundamental civil right if you really be annoyed get some legislation to create a dark sky zone where in all light emission be protect in the zone kind of like the national radio quiet zone do you know about that near teh radio telescope observatory in west virginia they have a 90 mile emcon zone theoretically they can prevent you from run light ac motor like air conditioner and vacuum in practice they use it mostly to control large radio user
 ssrt rollout speech deliver by col  simon p  worden the deputy for technology sdio mcdonnell douglas huntington beach april 3 1993 most of you a be i be    child of the 1960  s    we grow up in an age of miracle    inter continental ballistic missile nuclear energy computer flight to the moon but these be miracle of our parent  s do for a decade and more the pundit have told u    lose it    the    me    generation be only living on the accomplishment of the past you and i have even begin to believe the pessimist we listen in awe a the past generation tell of it triumph living history they be we be privileged to hear those who do it tell of it a few week ago some of this very team listen in awe a general bernie schriever told of his team  s work and yes struggle to build this nation  s intercontinental ballistic missile what story can we tell blurry eyed telescope thousand dollar toilet seat even our space launch vehicle hearken only of that past great time they be and seem destine to remain gen  schriever  s icbm i find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space lifter idea be to refurbish old minuteman and poseidon ballistic missile well the pessimist be wrong the legacy be continue this event be proof to our technological parent listen to your story caught your enthusiasm and can do spirit and learn from your achievement and your mistake let me honor one of you who be part of that history and the impetus behind this history max hunter you be one of the great engineer of the firts great age of space exploration your insight and discipline built the thor icbm later incorporate into today  s most successful launch vehicle the delta you told u in the 60  s that a new form of launch vehicle a single stage reusable rocket can and should be built you advocate this idea tirelessly it be elegantly simple a be all great breakthrough you show u how to build it you convince u it could be do you be work by our side to weld it component into place most important you remind u of a prime engineering principle undoubtably one you learn from the generation before you the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920  s and 30  s build a little and test a little and max you pass all of this on to people like pat ladner who start this program for the sdi douglas aircraft start with a dc 10 they even start with a dc 3 our grandfather built a little test a little even sell a little and make a little money before they move on to the next step they take a decade or more before put the first    rubber on the road    max hunter you take ten year to build thor and by god not go to take ten year to show that low cost single stage reusable aerospace transportation be real we end the cold war in a few short year it take the same team here today but a few year to show through the strategic defense initiative that the cold war must end we you and u launch a series of satellite the delta experiment in about a year apiece this more than anything else signal our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the soviet union those who make the decision on both side have underscored the importance of our work in bring about a new international relationship but it be the same team which be now put in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that be our legacy for the next generation we will make space access routine and affordable we built this magnificent fly machine in two year this summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time then we can and surely will build in the next three year a reusable sub orbital rocket it will allow u to use space rapidly affordably and efficiently a no other nation can and yes make a little money off it too then and only then spend another three year to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system the dc 3 of space will be a reality we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthrough of our former cold war adversary what a wonderful irony if this sdi product and russian effort to counter sdi merge to power mankind  s next step to the star to be sure we must guard against the temptation to leap to the final answer robert goddard  s first rocket saturn v  s if we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollar and a few more year to jump immediately to a full orbital system we will fail max hunter and his colleague show the way three year and a cloud of dust in our case rocket exhaust there be no short cut if we expect to reshape the world again we must do it one brick at a time mind on task at hand

 sure why keep use oil a hydrogen electric economy would likely be cleaner and more efficient in the long run the law of supply and demand should get the transition underway before we reach a critical stage of shortage
 the situation in this regard have change considerably in recent year see the discussion of    high power rocketry    in the rec models rockets frequently asked questions list this be not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy you need proper certification that can be have mostly through tripoli the high  power analog of the nar although the nar be cautiously move to extend the upper boundary of what it considers proper too you need special faa authorization but provide you do it under one of the lax runway approach or something stupid like that not especially hard to arrange a with model rocketry this sort of hardware be reasonably safe if handle properly proper handle take more care and you need a lot more empty air to fly in but basically just model rocketry scale up a with model rocketry the high power people use factory built engine which eliminates the major safety hazard of do it yourself rocketry
 for the purpose of a contest bet some thing could be cut like fuel for re entry any kind of heat shield etc  etc even still if the contest participant have to fund dc 1 development it probably be worth it to develop dc 1 just for the contest just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rat or at least under 6 or so g booster     if i have to pay for dc 1 development great i  ll use it but back to the contest goal there be a recent article in aw st about a low cost all relative     man return to the moon a general dynamic scheme involve a titan iv shuttle to lift a centaur upper stage lev and crew capsule the mission consists of deliver two unmanned payload to the lunar surface follow by a man mission total cost u be 10  13 billion joint esa  nasa project be 6  9 billion for the u share i find a mention of how long the crew could stay but bet that it around 30 day and the total payload deliver be about 30 metric tonne so if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew habitation module no return trip     and toss in a few more tonne for the additional consumables to last another 11 month then you  might  be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonne and in case it not obvious a wild as guess a pretty boring visit since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of lox and not certain if a home brew or college brewed life support system could last a year but let  s round this up to 19 4 tonne convient since the gd plan talk about 9 7 ton payload deliver to the lunar surface this add up to two centaur two lev two shuttle flight     all to put a single man on the moon for a year hmmm not really practical anyone get a cheaper better way of deliver 15 20 tonne to the lunar surface within the decade anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year  s supply of consumables and equipment would weigh and i be wonder about the gd lev be it reusable or be it discard to burn up on return to leo if it not discard could it be refuel henry do you know anything about the gd lev i note that it us rl 10 engine they reusable restartable would a lev fit in a dc 1 forgotten if i ever knew what the cargo bay dimension be for the dc 1 all in all not certain that the single goal prize of stay on the moon for a year be wise and or useful how about a prize for the first non government sponsered unmanned moon land then another for a man moon land then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil another for a reusable earth moon shuttle and so forth find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure     have a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents give up after one person appear to win and for those that give up i find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddle in rickety little moon shelter like to see a much a reward for co operation a for competition lastly about ten or fifteen year back i seem to recall that there be an english space magazine that have an on going discussion about moonbases on the cheap i recall it discuss thing like how much heat the human body produce how much lunar material it  d need for protection from solar flare etc unfortunately i remember the name of this magazine do this ring a bell to anyone
 i have to    try reading a bit    pat i  work  a a government contractor and know what the rule be like yes they sign some damn few    which be why everyone be always have to go to washington to see about next week  s funding multi year contract they also willing to include sufficient cancellation penalty when they  do  decide to cut the multi year contract and not pay on it which can happen arbitrarily at any time no matter what previous plan be to make the risk acceptable of something like put up a private space station with the government a the expect prime occupant like a source for that statement about    the reason they cut defense spending a much a they would like    i just buy it the other thing i find a bit  funny about your post pat be that several other people answer the question pretty much the same way i do mine be the one you comment and incorrectly i think on i think that say a lot you and tommy should move in together       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden

 well there already be a sulfate process for tio2 purification the chlorine process be cleaner however and for that reason be achieve dominance in the marketplace most ti be use in pigment btw a the oxide where it replace white lead pigment some decade ago very little be reduce to the metal which merely evades the issue of why those lunatic be there at all and why their child would want to stay
 no i estimate a 99 probability the gehrels refer to be thomas gehrels of the spacewatch project kitt peak observatory maybe in the 24th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on distant asteroid with an orbit observatory but here in the primitive 20th we have to send a probe there to get gamma ray spectroscopy do you have the info on mayan television yet
 yes give me his name i would greatly appreciate it rich
 the proton have be use in 2 3 and 4 stage version the two stage version be use for the first 3 launch while the 3 and 4 stage version be use today the four stage version be use mostly for escape and geosynchronous orbit while the 3 stage version be use for low earth orbit since this be the version that launch mir and the salyut and the add on module for mir a long a centaur be small than mir which i believe it be it should fit under the shroud i vaguely recall that the russian be develop a lh2 lox upper stage for the proton
 my poor old physic intuition will be very surprised if these tiny mass sit very close to jupiter play any role whatsoever in the problem or to put it more technically the extra    volume    they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectory be negligible jupiter be 2e27 kg while the galilean satellite be around 1e23 also a i say the few reference that look at do not mention outgassing or breakup a important process the important thing be a jupiter sun comet    reverse slingshot    that lead to a weakly jupiter bound orbit for the comet at least a temporary one

 in the april edition of    one small step for a space activist    allen sherzer tim kyger write    another problem be what be call  wraps or sometimes the  center tax when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle be perform at a nasa center the center skim off a portion which go into what amount to a slush fund this money be use to fund work the center manager want to fund this sum be estimate to be over a third of the fund allocate think about that of the 30 billion cost of freedom fully 10 billion be spent on anything have anything to do with space station now maybe that 10 billion be wisely spent and maybe it but the work do with it should stand on it own merit not distort the cost of other project congress have no idea of the existense of these wrap congress have never heard the term  center tax they look at the station they be get and the price they be pay and note that it add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money be go for something else    my dear friend your mix fact and fiction here a couple of week ago when i first read this in your post i talk with one of the cost expert here in space station at headquarters if you wonder why i post a response immediately i do have a real job suppose to be do here at headquarters dig up old 20 khz data look into sherzer kyger claim rate pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in kansa city at the national science teacher association conference extol the virtue of ssf to 15 000 science teacher first off yes the concept of  center tax or  wrap do exist if i recall the number correctly the total  tax  for the ssf program for this fiscal year be around 40 million this be compute by add up the wp 1 wp 2 and wp 4 center  taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at 2 2 billion my calculater say the tax percentage be 04 2 2 1 8 over the life of the ssf program use your figure of 30 billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a 1 8 rate come to 540 million this be alot less than 10 billion but i will concede still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1 3 could be close to the actual rate the tax be only charge on fund that be spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some state where you do have to pay sale tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you if you get it take out for example at wp 4 the vast bulk of the fund we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and be  not  subject to the center tax i have the number in front of me but guess at least 95 of the wp 4 fund go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of 1 3 but only apply to fund spent at the center and not to the prime contract this lead to the obvious question    what be the government do with ssf fund that go to the prime contractor i e ok wp 4 get a slice of the 30 billion pie a big portion of this slice go to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the fund which eat up by the center tax    at wp 4 we call these fund we spend in house support development fund a they be support the development work do by rocketdyne we have use these fund to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed have a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few year back with lead acid car battery to simulate the nickel hydrogen battery on ssf dc switchgear dc dc converter unit and simulated load data from the testbed be use in a recent change evaluation involve concern about the stability of the power system we have also use the support development money to purchase nickel hydrogen battery which be on life test at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana a a side point 6 of the battery cell on test recently hit the four year life test milestone 38 cell have complete 18 552 to 23 405 cycle the on orbit battery go through 5 840 cycle per year a a final example my  home division at lewis use the support development fund to purchase personal computer and work station for perform system analysis like model of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculation use a monte carlo simulation set up a database with information on weight of the power system element finally the money raise by the  tax do not all go into a  slush fund at lewis the director do control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however go to fund the  general  service at the center like the library the central computer service division the contractor who remove the snow etc thus it be rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget go for ssf activity to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library fund use to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for 1 year be  billable to ssf would you base it on the person hours ssf employee spend reading av week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that go to support the library who know maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare

 this be turn into  what  s a moonbase good for and i ought not to post when a hundred some odd post to go but i would think that the real reason to have a moon base be economic since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much large gnp than they would _without_ space industry eventually they will simply be able to afford more stuff if i read you right say in essence that with a large economy nation will have more discretionary fund to  waste  on a lunar facility that be certainly partially the case with apollo but real lunar colony will probably require a continue military scientific or commercial reason for be rather than just a    we have the money why not    approach ah but the whole point be that money spent on a lunar base be not waste on the moon not like be use 1000 1000r bill to fuel their moon dozers the money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belong a way of funding high tech research just like darpa be a good excuse to fund various field of research under the pretense that it be crucial to the defense of the country or like esprit be a good excuse for the ec to fund research under the pretense that good for pan european cooperation now maybe you think that government funded research be a waste of money in fact pretty sure you do but it do count a investment spending which do boost the economy and just look at the size of that multiplier

 brian yamauchi asks regard orbital billboard     well i have be collect data for next edition of the commercial space news space technology investor     to summarize space advertising first advertising on space vehicle be not new    it be very common practice to put the cooperate organization  s logo on the space launch vehicle for example the late gps launcher have the very prominent logo on it side of mcdonnell douglas the delta launcher rockwell international who built the gps satellite usaf who paid for the satellite and launch and the gps navstar program office this have not be consider    paid advertising    but rather    public relation    since the restriction have be such that only organization involve in the launch could put their logo on the side and there be no money exchange for this however put a 10 high logo on the side of the launch vehicle face the camera be    advertising    a much a it be    public relation    in my opinion and by the way i note that the dc x test vehicle have rather prominent mcdonnell douglas and sdio logo on the side     there have be several study look at the revenue potential for use of space vehicle for advertising or place large advertising sign in orbit on the shuttle for example i know of several serious study in the early and mid 1980  s which look at put logo on the external tank or on the side of the payload bay these venture would be different than    public relation    in that the logo or display would not be restrict to the firm participate on that flight and would involve payment of sum for the right to fly the logo in a prominent organization for example painting the et to look like a pepsi can or put a disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the camera would scan past it advert on launch vehicle the first paid advertising be do on a soviet launcher in about 1990 when several non involved foreign organization be allow to pay to put their logo on a proton launch an italian shoe company be one of the first advertiser i remember similarly soviet cosmonaut on mir make a paid advertisement for the last olympic game and have gleefully show banner and other item from participate firm and organization mar candy bar for example get a plug from orbit a a sponsor of the launch of the british visit cosmonaut to mir now u firm be start to put paid advertisement on launch vehicle the upcoming conestoga launch in june put the comet recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisement on the side for arnold schwarzenegger  s upcoming movie    the last action hero    besides the usual logo of the participate organization columbia picture have paid 500 000 to put ad on the main fuselage of the mission  s conestoga rocket it booster rocket and on the comet payload which will orbit the earth for one month a concept for this advertising display be publish in space news magazine a couple of month ago a a side note robert lorsch an advertising executive be talk about sue nasa he charge nasa with appropriate an idea he create with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorship on nasa spacecraft a a way to get funding for the space program lorsch contends that in sell advertising space on the upcoming comet nasa violate an agreement that it    would not use his idea without him be the exclusive representative for nasa and receive compensation    this be be dispute since the launch be a    commercial launch    and nasa be receive none of the advertising revenue but the funding for the comet program be come from nasa orbital    billboard    orbital    billboard    have be the staple of science fiction for some time arthur c  clarke write about one example and robert heinlein described another in    the man who sell the moon    several different potential project have be developed although none have be implement but the most real prior to 1993 be the    eiffel ii    project which would have place a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the french republic  s bi centennial cont

 and one of my prof be the chief engineer for the project dr  ron humble univ colorado at colorado spring i love the idea of an inflatable 1 mile long sign     it will be a really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt or even well a westford needle come crash into it at 10 click a sec boom whooooooooshhhhhh         sputter sputter okay pretend it would make a sound i hear insert favorite rumor here that it will supposedly coincide with the atlanta olympics
 great speculation i remember be proud on behalf of all the free world you think that way when you be seven year old that we have get there first now almost sorry that it work out that way i guess the soviet would have take the victory seriously too and would almost certainly not have fall victim to the complacency that overtook the u program perhaps stretch to match u effort would have destabilize them sooner than it do in fact and in the tradition of marvel comic  what if this destabilization in the brezhnev era might have trigger the third world war hmm maybe it be a giant leap after all

 the european space agency have involvement with remote earth observation and i presume this include surveillance optical etc  so not just the us ussr ex who be in the game but what  is  the game what can be do with space observation the military function of missile spot troop spot etc be well document but what about anything else the big eg i can think of be to get a metal sense sat over a pay country and scan their territory for precious metal more importantly if radar can spot water vapour cloud presumably a radar base sat will be capable of spot river open water and  underground water  from space this would be a positive life saver for african or other drought affected country implement a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such country and should cut down mortality considerably so how about it be there a charity or government agency that would pay for a third world country to have their mineral and water deposit mapped or be this still sci fi mail reply would be great thought for the day thermal energy need water to make steam so sstick it in the ocean
 commercial space news space technology investor number 22 this be number twenty two in an irregular series on commercial space activity the commentary include be my thought on these development sigh     a usual gotten behind in get this column write i can only plead the exigency of the current dynamic in the space biz this column be put together at lunch hour and after the house quiet down at night so data can quickly build up if there  s a lot of other stuff go on comply a lot of information and happening since the last column so go to have to work to keep this one down to a readable length have fun content 1  u commercial space sale flatten in 1993 2  delta win two key launch contract 3  commercial remote sense venture get doc    go ahead    4  investment firm call gd  s space

u commercial space sale flatten in 1993 the u department of commerce project u commercial space sale will remain flat in 1993 with current data show only a 2 percent growth over 1992  a publish in    u industrial outlook 1993    which be release in january revenue from the 1993 u space business be currently project to be about 4 890 m  in contrast to previous year when u commercial space sale have show double digit growth rate this year  s project result be driven by the u satellite manufacturing industry where sale be project to drop from 12 satellite worth 1 300 m in 1992 to 7 satellite worth 670 m in 1993  the u industrial outlook also project u s  commercial launcher face flat demand in come year and while predict that 1993 revenue will increase 10 percent to 450 m future sale will be    adversely affected by the downward revision in department of defense launch plan    offset flat launch revenue and satellite delivery revenue for fix and mobile satellite service be project to increase to 1 900 m primarily driven by increase revenue from broadcast and cable tv network similarly remote sense product and sale be project to increase to 250 m in 1993 up 15 u commercial space

industry be expect to do in 1993  in general not a bad report    with most of the bad news concentrate in the satellite manufacturing area there change of only a few satellite worth 100 m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection if we look forward over several year this market sector should retain strong sale a u firm have be very successful in regain international market share in the satellite business furthermore sale of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data expect to be release about mid  year data on mobile satellite ground equipment sale include such item a gps receiver and portable satellite terminal appear to be miss from the january data set doc usually publishes a listing of    space business indicator    in mid year and the next revision of commercial space revenue should be release then i expect the revise revenue should easily top 5 000 m if the mobile satellite ground equipment be add back into the number and the year should show about a 10 overall market growth look beyond this year  s data future market look quite promising the doc project satellite service revenue could top 3 000 m by 1995 if new mobile satellite service and direct broadcasting be implement a plan and that mobile satellite station sale be expect to continue to growth at 15 20 per year through the mid 1990  s my number be somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but i agree the trend should be for substantial growth in u commercial space sale over at least the next 5 10 year my pessimism be due to more conservative assumption on market capture and growth in leo communication and satellite direct broadcasting service i believe all of the current player in the yet to be born leo communication satellite market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcasting market will be financial success nor that sale growth will be a explosive a currently project it should also be note this year  s doc data be the first release to show revenue from privately fund microgravity research facility the 60 m show in the janurary data be primarily for the spacehab module plan for launch in april on the space shuttle but also hidden in these number be the project first sale from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module 2  delta win two key launch contract mcdonnell douglas corporation which build and market the delta launch vehicle have won two important launch contract motorola inc  announce in mid february that it have select the delta to launch most of the satellite in the 66 satellite iridium leo communication constellation and in mid april mcdonnell douglas be award the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract the launch service contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch be for at launch of least 45 iridium satellite another 21 satellite have be contract to be launch by khrunichev enterprise in russian on 3 proton vehicle launch these 45 satellite plan for the delta will be launch 5 at a time provide for at least 9 launch additional satellite in the iridium constellation such a a plan on orbit spare may also be launch on delta although detail of the launch service contract be report to be negotiation and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also go to mdc bidding a variant of their delta ii launcher this contract be only initially worth 7 5 million but establishes a set of launch option for up to 36 launch encompass launch from 1996 through 2002  these launch will deploy the next generation of the usaf  s global position system block iir navigation satellite plus other program first option for to meet the usaf launch option be expect to be exercise this year after which the usaf be expect to request launch of up to 6 delta per year for at least 6 year under this contract the usaf can also request    launch on demand    service from mdc for the 1996 2002 time period with a launch to occur within 40 day of the request commentary if these two contract be fulfil they should provide an excellent business base for mdc  s delta launch program through the turn of the century combine these two contract have a potential for about 45 launch worth about 2 200 m to mdc and sustain a core business base of 300 400 m year other contract for international and commercial payload a well a for nasa medium elv class payload will add to this business base    keep mdc a a viable commerical launch company however it should be note there be risk element in these contract motorola  s iridium leo communication constellation have not yet receive a u federal communication commission license for operation in the u s  nor have motorola line up all the financing and financial partner for the iridium venture without these approval or financial backing there will be no iridium launch but hopefully these uncertainty will be settle this year similarly the usaf mlv iii program have be the target of several congressional action which have slow the production of the gps block iir satellite and delete the funding for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nls     spacelifter    program at this time while it appear the mlv iii contract will be execute future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contract be be reconsider a part of national space launch strategy review some opinion express from within the administration and congress propose cancellation of all    elv upgrade    program include the mlv program in favor of the propose    spacelifter    program such opinion may have some weight in this year  s budget deliberation particularly a dod fund will be more difficult to find in the shrink u defense budget 3  commercial remote sense venture get doc    go ahead    the first commercial license to operate a remote sense satellite be approve in early february by the u department of commerce  s office of space commerce a license be grant to worldview image corporation of oakland california to build and operate a pair of leo image satellite to provide multi spectral image of the earth commentary there have be little data release on this venture by worldview and the doc other than the announcement of the operating and construction license this be report to be at the request of worldview most industry speculation identifies this new venture a a    star war    spinoff use sdi type technology to provide digital earth sense data and heavily integrate into digital gi database for remote sensing gis user most probable customer for this service include exploration geologist agricultural planner and urban planner it be noteworthy this be the first commercial venture under the 1992 land remote sense policy act the act a pass last november provide that remote sense data gather from private remote sense craft may be sell to user at differ price prior to this act remote sense data from all satellite have to be sell to all user at the same price and private remote sense venture would have have to sell at the government set landsat data price there be rumor of several other potential commercial remote sense venture work their way through the system at different stage of development i think the large landsat and spot satellite system will provide the majority of the satellite remote sense data market for the next decade or so in contrast to these large government sponsored remote sense system small market venture such a worldview and others can exploit market niche and use innovative technology and i believe can find profitability on the margin i predict there may be some very interest venture appear in the next year or so 4  investment firm call gd  s space biz    still a good investment    wall street investment house morgan stanley think general dynamic  s space system division could still be a moneymaker despite have fail in the last 3 atlas launch in a recent analyst  s report morgan stanley say    we be more than ever convince that if the company can return the atlas to it historical 95  plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash  generate unit    base upon discussion with gd  s corporate management morgan stanley project that if the atlas problem be clear up the unit could see 70 m in earnings per year by 1995 and 100 m per year by 2000  this be base upon gd  s projection of capture about 10 atlas launch per year on the world market commentary three failure in a row of their launch system have hurt general dynamic  s space system division since gd have restructure to only keep a very few profitable core business many market pundit have be speculate gd  s space business might be next to be sell the morgan stanley report indicates gd  s space system division have some potential a a moneymaker despite current problem    if they can get their act together sale be project to be about 560 m in 1993 which will probably generate a loss of about 25 m  if gd can capture their project share of the space launch market and if they have manage to clean up the reliability of their atlas launcher then they could generate healthy profit from those sale but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program be back on track this division will continue to show substantial loss in response to the sell off rumor in my opinion this operation be not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replace with another set from outside the firm in gd ssd  s case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problem with the atlas centaur a well a in sell atlas service this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operation could find such talent in house and be able to convince customer to buy their launch service optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in marketing space technology internationally a well candidate for this might be trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing but most of those firm have cash flow problem mdc have have a substantial business contraction boeing and mdc be involve with other launch firm lockheed or have take on substantial debt martin and come up with the 700 1500 m purchase price for the division be a big chunk of change for any company 5 ariane predicts dip in launch demand arianespace the operator of the ariane launch system be project a dip in launch demand in the late 1990  s in early february arianespace release their annual market survey which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade over short run arianespace expect to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market of 54 international and commercial launch plan through 1995 ariane hold contract for 31 general dynamic atlas vehicle hold 14 contract mcdonnell douglas delta hold 7 and great wall  s long march vehicle hold 2 launch contract three quarters of future launch contract for which ariane can compete be project to come from communication satellite with the remain 25 split between weather earth observation and scientific satellite most of the future telecommunication demand growth be predict to come from the asia pacific region arianespace expect the current market consolidation of individual satellite operator into regional or national group will continue with these group invest in heavier satellite with large communication payload carry more transponder arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunication satellite should increase by 20 over today  s average level to about 3000 kg in geo demand for commercial launch service be expect to remain strong over the next three year but in the second half of the decade arianespace predicts demand will decrease arianespace base this prediction upon a match of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly a new data compression technique appear to could double or triple transponder capacity use exist or near term transponder one of the significant possible change in the market be identify a the arrival of new launch vehicle include russian launch system but arianespace predicts that in the long term investor purchasing launch service be look for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch service will have to prove out their capability and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal commentary ariane release their market survey annually and i report on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn sti compare the two survey there outstanding difference in the number the most notable change be the consideration of new data compression technique reduce the demand for new physical transponder on orbit i note that in contrast to some prediction demand for space  base communication transponder appear to be remain strong while fiber optic line be make substantial inroad into the establish point to point telecommunication market grow demand for telecommunication service world wide and for point to  multipoint broadcast service have prevent a decrease in space transponder demand fiberoptic cable provide a high capability service but only from establish point a to establish point b  to establish a fiberoptic link it be necessary to install cable between the point and while there be improve network solution instal a large network of distribute fiberoptic link can cost million or billion of dollar for broadcast service where there be not an exist ground network structure satellite still offer the most cost effective solution and if new service be require into a new region it be cheaper to install a small satellite link cost only a few ten of thousand of dollar and tie into the exist global satellite network this allows rapid growth of new satellite service and have kept demand high the replacement market for fiberoptics be grow a well since a demand grows between the point service it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic since the telecommunication and data transfer market be still grow rapidly satellite market projection remain rosy but satellite be also get longer orbital lifetime current generation satellite be now get guarantee of at 15 year of on orbit service or more in contrast to 10 year of service from last generation  s satellite this have cut back some of the launch demand a satellite owner be reschedule replacement satellite launch over longer interval and a last note arianespace flag it this year but it look like the space transportation market will be rather over  supply by exist launch system in the near term the annual commercial launch demand be for about 15 20 medium size satellite per year from the supply side ariane be capable of launch up to about a dozen medium size satellite a year delta be capable of about 9 12 per year atlas be capable of 6 12 long march 4 8 japan  s h vehicle 2 4 russia  s proton capable of 8 and other system such a zenit and soyuz another 10 20 medium launch per year a lot of capability for a small market we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launch 6  ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the 9 feb pegasus launch by orbital science corporation have spawn an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rule a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission be overridden and the pegasus be launch in violation of range safety rule in the last few minute of the pegasus launch countdown one of two abort command receiver aboard the pegasus fail such a failure typically scrub a launch and a nasa range safety officer at wallop island va issue a mission abort order about a minute before the schedule pegasus launch somehow this command be overridden by the osc launch team or the message be lose in the communication channel and the pegasus be launch despite the valid abort call fortunately the pegasus function a expect and the abort command receiver be not need but this incident do spark an investigation since a valid abort order be give under agreed to launch constraint rule and be not obeyed lead the investigation be the national transportation safety board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force this investigation mark the first time ntsb have take the lead on an incident involve a space launch accord to the ntsb their investigation will take about 6 month and be primarily look at line of authority communication link and safety procedure use in the launch commentary this be the first time that the ntsb have lead an investigation into a space launch their leadership be request by the department of commerce  s office of commercial space transportation who have license the commercial launch at the time of write this column some of the initial investigation have be conclude and some of the result be start to leak out into the trade press apparently 3 or four different communication channel be in use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stop respond the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallop island give abort order about a minute before the launch accord to the mission rule this should have stop the launch somehow the osc test conductor order the abort reverse and the nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b 52 carry the pegasus at about 22 second before launch differ explainations of exactly how this happen be propose    with the best set be that clear line of communication and clear definition of the responsibility of the mission control team and understand of the mission rule be not establish before the launch a we see more and more commercial launch more of these procedural issue be go to crop up and will have to be resolve this case be interest because it be the first time the ntsb have be call in to investigate a commercial launch problem a they do with commercial aircraft problem i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problem with procedure and communication and will be clear up with issuance of guideline on how launch communication should be set up and how specific line of authority should be delineate 7  another pegasus competitor be announce tsniimach enterprise in russia announce it be marketing a new small space launch system base upon convert icbm component two version of the launcher be be market the    aerokosmos    wing vehicle launch like the osc pegasus and the    severkosmos    launch from a mobile ground transporter the aerokosmos be project to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit and the severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbit and 225 kg to 800 km also propose to be use with these launch system be a leo data relay system call  sineva tsniimach enterprise be described a a ex military establishment focus on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which have participate in the development of the buran shuttle system they be locate near the npo energia facility in kaliningrad outside of moscow commentary there  s very little release information on this new venture my suspicion be it be another russian enterprise look for hard currency and try to capitalize upon their in house knowledge of ex soviet launch system it add to the list of numerous commercial space startup announce from the ex soviet union this one  s a little different in that they be offering variant of ex soviet icbm but i identify any key customer be target or substantial financial backing 8  georgia launch site drop from planning in late january georgia tech research institute release the result of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launch site in camden county georgia at the old kingsland missile test launch site on the atlantic coast the preliminary study recommend the site not be pursue a a commercial launch site state reopen the site be not feasible due to project low investment return plus environmental and other geographic consideration however the report do say the site might be ideal for other aerospace us and recommend other potential us commentary this should put the nail in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site while other site be still proceed with commercial launch site development plan kingsland found without a key customer to act a anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure have to be put in then the expect return be too low to justify the cost of development this might point out some key discriminator in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site these include be there an identify key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup cost be there a market advantage of use the site can exist infrastructure be use or modify at the site can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment other commercial launch site venture    include those at woomera poker flat cape york white sand alabama off shore platform hawaii and vandenberg have to also be judged against these criterion in my opinion some of these venture be fly on hope and speculation and not on sound financial ground 9  spain  s capricornia launcher still proceed in one of his last official act former president bush authorize space technology transfer for several joint space venture between u and other firm one of these be a propose use of u technology by spain to build a small booster with that regulatory impediment remove the 3 stage capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first launch in the 1995 96 time period the capricornia be described a a small 3 stage all solid booster design to put 250 500 kg into leo several launch site be be examine for the system include 2 on the iberian peninsula and 1 on the canary island originate by inta in spain the project report it have 30 m in development funding and will use technology from argentina  s condor launch vehicle a well a from the u commentary several firm have identify a market opportunity in provide a small launcher for the european market small payload from european firm or organization currently use either ariane piggyback launch or the us italian scout launcher however ariane piggyback opportunity be limited and the scout program be be phase out accompany by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regard any follow on system this have left an apparent niche for a new european small launch system surprisingly enough esa have not support development of such a system within the current space funding structure study have be perform by british aerospace aerospatiale deutsche aerospace and italian organization but with the exception of the swedish pacastro system report below i have not be able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware also of interest be the link of the capricornia to the argentinian condor launcher there have be some interest rumor surface out of argentina over the past year about a space launcher irbm program fund under the military junta which rule the country in the 1970  s and early 1980  s what be know be in feb 1992 the argentinian air force formally transfer control of the condor 2 missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency comison nacional de atividades espaciales cnae the condor 2 program be described a originate in 1983 expand upon the small condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firm the condor 2 be also reportedly fund indirectly by iraq in the mid 1980  s fairly large solid rocket motor be built and test but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lag that of the propulsion system it should be note cnae be planning to launch it first scientific satellite in late 1994  the u 9 m 181 kg sac b satellite will study the earth  s upper atmosphere and include cooperative experiment from italy and the u no launch vehicle have yet be select but osc  s pegasus and the russian burlak air launch rocket be report to be strong contender for this contract 10  pacastro sign launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro a small launch firm in herndon virginia announce in late february it have receive a 6 m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro  s pa 2 launch vehicle this will be perform a part of the polar satellite service ps a joint norwegian space center  swedish space corp  program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offering small satellite launch into the polar region accord to pacastro ps be also perform an 8 m upgrade of the andoya launch facility include a new integration facility and a fully  enclose vertical assembly building for small launch vehicle like the pacastro pa 2 pacastro have be chosen a    the main alternative rocket supplier    for the small satellite launch service to be offer by ps from andoya the date of the launch of the swedish satellite be not specify commentary pacastro have be try to line up customer and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now the pa 2 be a small two stage rocket fuel by rp 1 and liquid oxygen from pacastro  s literature the engine design for the pa series rocket be built of    off the shelf    component base upon the lunar module descent engine built by trw and be capable of put a 225 kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit pacastro be try to arrange construction financing for it first three pa 2 vehicle with a first launch plan for 1995 and 2 orbital launch plan for 1996  my record show pacastro hire trw to provide marketing support and system design with primary engineering to be do by aeroastro a small satellite builder closely associate with pacastro headquarter in the same building the swedish space corporation would supply engineering launch operation vehicle subsystem and marketing support sumitomo corp  of tokyo be a first round investor and sits on the board of director pacastro have gotten a first round financial package of at least 550 k some source place this of high a 1 m but have be search for about a year for the additional 20 30 m need to design build and launch their first set of vehicle the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be use to help bring some investor on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single 6 m sale to put their venture into real hardware 11  china and taiwan joint satellite venture report in early march it be report a joint satellite communication venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese be in the work a report in the taipei press china development corp  cdc headquarter in taiwam and with link to the ruling nationalist party be planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp  with the objective of launch a regional communication satellite cdc would cover about 10 of the satellite system cost u 10 m in exchange for right to 10 of the satellite  s communication channel commentary this announcement come close on the heel of the release of taiwanese plan for space development release in mid january in those plan the national space program office of taiwan will launch 3 satellite start with rocsat 1 a 400 kg scientific spacecraft plan for launch in 1997  two additional satellite be plan both communication satellite trw have be help taiwan plan this program budget at t 13 6 b u 530 m through 2006  i be able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the nspot but there might be a connection while taiwan have the financing to pursue several venture the current taiwanese telecommunication market might not support two separate sastellite venture the report name for the tiawanese chinese system be    asiasat  2    but i think this have any relationship with the exist hong kong based    asiasat    program involve chinese hong kong and other asian investor other than use it a an organizational model there be some obvious advantage to pursue such a joing venture    it could provide excellent first hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost which then can be use in later satellite venture but there be internal political issue between taiwanese and chinese venture but put any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed in any case the east asian satellite market be light up with substantially growth project in space service and revenue this be just another indicator to add to the list 12  south korea announces national move into space technology south korea  s trade industry and resource ministry recently announce plan to invest u 22 b in research and development and another u 17 b into manufacturing and research facility for advanced aerospace technology space technology have be specifically target a part of this program begin with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi purpose satellite by 1997  the objective of this investment be to raise south korea  s aerospace technology to the level of the world  s top 10 country by 2000 commentary south korea have be quietly work to develop it national aerospace industry specifically include space activity note this a a flag that potential new player be come into the commercial space market a part of their national effort 2 national telecommunication satellite for korea telecom will be launch in april and oct 1995 on delta designate koreasat 1 and 2 the platform will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula southwestern japan and portion of china bordering north korea south korea launch it first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug 1992 call uribyol 1 our star and cost about u 8 8 m  uribyol 2 be plan for piggyback launch in october of this year again on ariane and will be entirely    make in korea    uribyol 3 project for a 1995 launch will be an environment  monitoring micro satellite this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellite the keos korean earth observation system project which have be submit for approval to the south korean government would use two or three 300 kg spacecraft equip with optical and microwave sensor south korean press report claim there be also a parallel military effort to establish the capability for building and launch small military satellite by 2001  supposedly a government panel have be establish to oversee such an effort fund at u 500 m between 1993 and 2001 in anticipation of an expect pullout of u s  intelligence gathering system from the korean peninsula in conjunction with all of these report effort south korean be also pursue production work either a off sets to exist aerospace technology contract for example mcdonnell douglas be offset production of some delta part to south korean firm a part of the koreasat launch contract or for production of consumer space item among other product south korea export satellite receiver television setup to japan and samsung have announce team for production of osc  s orbcomm user terminals  this look like a very aggressive push into space technology consider that east asia be currently the fast grow sector for commercial space service primarily for telecommunication a south korean push into space technology may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade 13  space technology index through march a announce in the last csn sti each issue will give the result of stock index and portfolio regard space stock and investment the table below summarizes result to the end of march the space technology index do quite a bit well than the market a a whole a represent by the s p 500 index since 90  of the value include in the index be u firm this represent a general increase in the market value of space related firm the increase in the first quarter be more than in all of 1992    which be a very promising sign although future month may reverse this trend the commercial space technology index have also do quite well but the pure play portfolio    consist of stock

what this column  s already full and i still have bunch of commercial space development to report on a i say at the start of this column there  s be a lot of interest happening but i  ll have to put them into the next issue look ahead get several article in the work on new happening with iridium and the leo communication satellite market more news on international launcher appear and disappear on the market new international commercial space venture and other interest development and a always i hope you folk find this stuff useful and interest    any and all comment be welcome
 my understand that the freeze will start to occur because of the grow distance of pluto and charon from the sun due to elliptical orbit it be not due to shadow effect pluto can shadow charon and vice versa george krumins
 heard of sillier thing like a well known utility company want to buy an  automated boiler cleaning system which us a many operator a the old system and which rumour have it cost three million more per unit automation be more  efficient although by what scale they be not say
 some time ago i sent the follow message every once in a while i design an orbital space colony gear up to do another one some info from you if you be to move onto a space colony to live permanently how big would the colony have to be for you to view a permanent move a desirable specifically how many people do you want to share the colony with what physical dimension do the living be need to have assume 1g living the colony will rotate assume that you can leave from time to time for vacation and business trip if young enough assume that raise your child there i get a lot of response and they be all over the block thanx muchly to all those who respond it be good food for thought here  s the edit response i get how many people do you want to share the colony with 100 what physical dimension do the living be need to have cylinder 200m diameter x 1 km long rui sousa ruca saber si pt                                                                               100 000 250 000 100 square km surface divide into city town village and countryside must have lake river amd mountain                                                                               1000 1000 people really that large a number everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year and will probably be sick of everyone else within another year hm i be not all that great at figure it out but i would maximize the percentage of colony space that be accessible to human esecially if there be to be child since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways and everyone especially me like to    go explore        i would want to be able to go for a walk and see something different each time                                                                                   for population i think i would want a substantial town    big enough to have stranger in it this help get away from the small town    everybody know everything    syndrome which some people like but i call it several thousand people for physical dimension a somewhat similar criterion big enough to contain surprise at least until you spent considerable time get to know it a a more specific rule of thumb big enough for there to be place at least an hour away on foot call that 5km which mean a 10km circumference if talk a sphere henry spencer at u of toronto zoology henry zoo toronto edu utzoo henry                                                                               my desire for permanent move to a space colony assume easy communication and travel size about a small town size say 9 sq km  course big be well population about 100 sq km or less so  1000 for 9sqkm less be well for elbow room more for interest and sanity so say max 3000 min 300  tommy mac                                                                                                             tom mcwilliams 517 355 2178 work      inhale to the chief 18084tm ibm cl msu edu 336 9591 hm      zonker harris in 1996

 well say okay del so michael be be unfair but you be be unfair back he be take college course now i presume he be study hard and his posting reveal that he be  somewhat  hip to the technical issue of astronautics plus he be attentively follow the erudite discourse of the big brain who post to sci space be it not inevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from reading the like of you and me 1 like others involve in sci space mr  adam show symptom of be a fledgling member of the technoculture and i think soak it up fast i be a young guy with dream once and they lead me to get a technical education to follow them up too bad i wound up in an assembly line job stamp out identical neutrino day after day     1 though rumor persist that del and i be both pseudonym of fred mccall

 do anyone have any russian contact space or other or contact in the old ussr su or eastern europe post them here so we all can talk to them and ask questions   i think the cost of email be high so we would have to keep the content to specific topic and such   basically if we want to save russia and such then we need to make contact contact be a form of info so let get inform    michael adam nsmca acad3 alaska edu    not high just jacked
 hi write a science fiction script and look for some answer to question regard the moon and earth my start point be an impossible situation i checked with a professor at berkeley and his response be a very helpful    happen    if you enjoy play with unusual idea and be willing answer some question please contact me via e mail jennise dgi com i get extremely annoyed when screen and tele plays ignore basic fact about computer that determine to be a scientifically accurate a i can sorry for be vague but like to protect my idea a much a i can until ready to sell it hopefully
 be to three talk in the last month which might be of interest transcribed some of my note below since my note take ability be by no mean infallible please assume that all factual error be mine permission be grant to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operation of rimsat be invite to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis be an organization on campus that deal with arm control disarmament and international security rimsat be consider an appropriate topic because the company be use russian launcher and satellite i think it also help that his daughter be a grad student in the international relation program the concept behind rimsat apparently begin when matt neilson go to tonga to visit a friend while he be there he somehow end up visit the king who happen to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish which the king thought be really nifty since tonga have a gnp of about 70 million his majesty ask if there be any way to make money off this matt thought there probably be so at his suggestion tonga apply for 31 geosynchronous satellite slot while this entirely off the wall it be very unusual see a tonga be a tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 be a lot of slot the whole thing be debate in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who be apparently a respect space lawyer write several opinion support tonga  s case eventually tonga end up with 7 slot range from 70 e to 170 e slot be designate by the longitude over which they reside accord to sternberg four of these from 130 e to 142 e be the best in the world because they be excellently place for communication between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat be form to use these slot it be officially form in nevis a a tax haven they try for a few year to raise fund in the west however to fill 7 slot with western satellite launch on western launcher would have cost approximately 2 billion not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of use russian hardware they begin negotiate with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh term that i think i  ll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comfort he be not happy with the way that people operate for example    everybody can sell you everything    everyone can show the proper document and license that indicate they be the only one who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arrange a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellite at a cost of 150 million however glavkosmos lose favor after the coup sternberg say that this be because they be basically a bunch of kgb operative who go to trade show and picked up lot of brochure since glavkosmos be out of power he have to renegotiate the deal with the new authority he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable term eventually he work out a deal and on dec 4 1992 he met with koptev who head the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insist on a few concession before signing and accord to sternberg he arrange these new rule to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing a rimsat the next step be to meet with the builder of the hardware npo apply mechanic    npo pm to use their acronym this organization be locate in siberia figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and have built about 1500 vehicle since the dawn of the space age sternberg comment that siberian be very different from musovites they be hard worker honest people who team up to get thing do very much like midwesterners at this point there be some comment from the audience that agree with his opinion on both siberian and midwesterners sternberg have lot of good thing to say about npo pm his company be apparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partners it apparently cost the russian about 4 million to build a satellite that would sell for 50 million in the west if you want to give them specification build you a satellite for the particular satellite that rimsat will be use cost run about 378 000 per transponder year this compare to 810 000 t y in the u s  they can sell their time for about 1 1 million compare to 2 6 million in the u s  rimsat will launch their satellite on proton to get the best price they bought in bulk they have the right to twelve launch so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch be schedule for october and they be get one use satellite from the russian which be be move into place now tidbit sternberg say this kind of thing have to be do by entrepreneur not big business because big business be just like what they have over there except that    we have well paper both in the bathroom and in the copier    russian launch be self insured the promise to replace a fail launch within 9 month major investor in rimsat include russell 20 20 which be a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which be a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operate by some of the big name in u s aerospace which he say be sort of an insurance policy for them if this really take off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr say that we be worried partly because we use to see russia a anything but an unvarying monolith italy get a new government    every two week    but we worry because use to it he predict that once we get use to see what really go on in russia we worry about their stability a much part of the problem with cooperative venture be the problem of transfer money the central bank have a policy of take hard currency payment put 25 in their coffer and replace the rest with the    equivalent    value in ruble to get around this rimsat pay their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pay their contractor with foreign currency so that the only the contractor get swindle by the government one of the big problem rimsat have have be stonewall by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellite which be rather reassure the big worry most people have about russian satellite be the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the old gorizont horizon satellite have a lifetime of about 5 year while the more modern express satellite compare well with western technology and last about 8 year while this be much shorter than 15 year for western satellite sternberg downplayed the difference at these price they can afford to launch new one in addition shorter lifetime mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete well than old out of date hardware
 but with cheaper fuel from space base source it will be cheaper to reach more orbit than from the ground also remember that the presence of a repair supply facility add value to the space around it if you can put your satellite in an orbit where it can be reach by a ready source of supply you can make it cheaper and gain benefit from economy of scale allen
    i hold that space can not be curve for the simple reason that it can have no property       of property we can only speak when deal with matter fill the space to say that in the presence of large body space becomes curve be equivalent to state that something can act upon nothing i for one refuse to subscribe to such a view    nikola tesla       et    tesla be 100 year ahead of his time perhaps now his time come

 actually hiten originally intend to go into lunar orbit at all so it indeed have much fuel on hand the lunar orbit mission be an afterthought after hagoromo a tiny subsatellite deployed by hiten during a lunar flyby have a transmitter failure and it proper insertion into lunar orbit be positively confirm it should be note that the technique do have disadvantage it take a long time and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit if you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel although it be reduce from what need for the brute force approach
 any comment on the absorbtion of the office of exploration into the office of space science and the reassignment of griffin to the    chief engineer    position be this just a meaningless administrative shuffle or do this bode ill for sei in my opinion this seem like a bad thing at least on the surface griffin seem to be someone who be actually interested in get thing do and who be willing to look an innovative approach to get thing do faster well and cheaper unclear to me whether he will be able to do this at his new position do anyone know what his new duty will be    _______________________________________________________________________________

 nope confuse separate program atlas be the first generation u icbm titan i be the second generation one titan ii which all the titan launcher be base on be the third generation heavy icbm there be essentially nothing in common between these three program yes  three  program despite the similarity of name titan i and titan ii be completely different missile they even use the same fuel never mind the same launch facility
 they do the rollout already i be go to have to pay more attention to the news be any of the gifs head for wuarchive patrick
 wishful think mostly more likely that the moon will never be the site of major commercial activity a far a we know it have no material we get cheaper right here on earth or from asteroid and comet aside from the semi mythic he3 that  might  be useful in low grade fusion reactor explore it would satisfy a curiosity itch and position in the gravity well of earth couple with heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for    high ground    military weapon system but it hold very minute commercial value if space travel becomes cheap enough it might become a tourist attraction a mt everest and the antarctic have become but a very minor activity in the global scope of thing luna have an inconvienent gravity field likely too low to prevent calcium loss muscle atrophy and long term genetic drift yet too high to do micro g manufacturing space base colony and factory that can be spun to any convienent value of g look much well luna have a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two week a month but orbital site can have well vacuum and continous solar exposure luna offer a source of light element rock that can serve a raw material heatsink and shield the asteroid and comet offer source of both light and heavy element and volatile compound and many be in less steep gravity well so that less delta v be require to reach them we use 2 3rds of the earth now the seafloors and we virtually ignore antarctica a whole continent because we have to deal with those condition in order to make a buck luna be a much more expensive place to visit or to live and work i think use the easy place first that push lunar development back at least a few century if not much longer luna  s main short term value would be a a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory shield from the noisy earth or a the site of a laser particle beam or linear accelerator weapon system for defend earth or bombarding it a the case may be the first be unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument the second be just a unlikely because conventional nuke be good enough and the military would really rather see the earth safe for conventional warfare again there  s little glory in watch from a bunker a machine fight each other over continental range little ultimate profit either gary

 sei level 5 the high level    the sei stand for software engineering institute not sure but i believe that this rating only applies to the flight software also keep in mind that it be  not  achieve through the use of sophisticated tool but rather through a  brute force and ignorance attack on the problem during the challenger standdown they simply threw hundred of people at it and do the whole process by hand i would not consider receive a  warning  status on system which be not yet in use would detract much if anything from such a rating    i  ll have to get the late copy of the guideline to make sure they just issue new one i think also keep in mind that the sei level be concerned primarily with control of the software process the assumption be that a well control process will produce good software also keep in mind that sei level 5 be damn hard most software in this country be produce by  engineering practicies that only rate an sei level 1 if that       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden

 excellent discussion of dc x land technique by henry delete the dc x will not take of horizontally it take of vertically for several reason vertical landing require mile of runway and limit noise pollution they require wheel or wing just turn on the engine and touch down of course a henry point out vetical landing quite that simple well to be blunt yes but at least learn the soyuz vehicle use parachute for the descent and then fire small rocket just before they hit the ground parachute be however not especially practical if you want to reuse something without much effort the landing be also not very comfortable however in the word of georgy grechko    i prefer to have bruise not to sink

 can someone please remind me who say a well know quotation he be sit atop a rocket await liftoff and afterwards in answer to the question what he have be think about say approximately    half a million component each have to work perfectly each supply by the low bidder           attribution and correction of the quote would be much appreciate
 i see any speculation about it but the salyut kb design bureau be planning a new lh lox second stage for the proton which would boost payload to leo from about 21000 to 31500 kg geostationary go from 2600 kg gal launcher version to 6000 kg   this scheme be compete with the energia m last year and i heard which won except now i recently read that the central specialized kb be work on the successor to the soyuz booster which must be the energia m  so the early result be energia m won but this be a guess nothing be very clear in russia sure if salyut kb get fund from someone they will continue their development the centaur for the altas be about 3 meter dia and the proton be 4 so a good fit for their exist upper stage the block d which set inside a shround just under 4 meter dia i know about launch load etc   but since the centaur survives titan launch which be probably bad than the proton those titan srb  s probably shake thing up pretty good it seem feasible except the centaur be a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which be not available now proton be assemble and transport horizontially do anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a centaur could support while bolt to a proton horizontally and then take down the rail road track and erect on the pad they would also need lox and lh facility add to the proton pad unless the new proton second stage be actually built and of course any centaur support system and facility no doubt import from the u at great cost these system may viloate u law so there be political problem to solve in addition to the instability in the ci you mention
 stuff delete glad to see that someone be work on this however it would be nice if he get his unit right
 i think so at first but solid state offer well reliabity id bet and any low cost would be only after the process really scale up

 a what about positional uncertainty in s l 1993e i assume we know where and what galileo be do within a few meter but without the hga we have to have some pretty good idea of where to look before image if the hga be work they could slew around in near real time less speed of light delay but when they be image toutatis someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first image also i imagine s l 1993e will be mostly a visual image so how will that affect the other image mission with the lga there be a real tight allocation of bandwidth it may be premature to hope for answer but i thought throw it on the floor

 can somebody elaborate on    area ruling    i gather something to do with aerodynamics of trans sonic plane and can be summarise a    coke bottle good coke can bad    anyone provide more detail derivation etc
 the cu people have be and continue to be big ozone scientist so this be consistent it be also consistent with the new    comercial application    that nasa and clinton be push so hard do anyone catch the rocket that be launch with a movie advert all over it i think the rocket people get alot of for painting up the side with the movie stuff what about the coke pepsi thing a few year back nasa have be try to find way to get other people into the space funding business for some time frankly thought about try it too when the funding get tight only the innovative get fund one of the thing nasa be big on be co funding if a pi can show co funding for any proposal that proposal have a significantly high probability of be fund than a proposal with more merit but no co funding once again money talk
 hi i be reading through    the spaceflight handbook    and somewhere in there the author discus solar sail and the force act on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit the magnitude of such acceleration he estimate to be on the order of 700g he also say that this be may not be a big problem for man craft because human and this be publish in 1986 have already withstood acceleration of 45g all this be very long winded but here  s my question finally be 45g acceleration in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical device of course if these be possible what be use to absorb the acceleration can this be extend to large acceleration

 of course sorry for the misunderstand i be refer to the fact that far more aeronautical development take place in the  30  s for much of the  20  s the super abundance of jenny and ox 5 engine held down the industry by 1926 many of the obsolete wwi aircraft have be retire and whirlwind have their power weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long distance flight become practical important to note that the atlantic be flown not once but three time in 1927 lindbergh chamberlin and levine and byrd  s _america_    when time to railroad you railroad    not off the top of my head i  ll have to dig out my reference book again however i will say that the most common arrangement in prince henry the navigator  s portugal be for the prince to put up part of the money and merchant to put up the rest they profit from the voyage would then be share the problem be that the amount of prize money require to inspire a moon base be much large than any but a handful of individual or corporation can even consider put up the kremer prize human power aircraft orteig  s prize lord northcliffe  s prize for cross the atlantic won in 1919 by alcock and brown be much small the technology require be within the reach of individual inventor and the prize amount be well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individual i think that only a gov t could afford to set up a 1b  prize for any purpose whatsoever note that burt rutan suggest that nasp could be built most cheaply by take out an ad in avweek state that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be hand 3b no question ask
 other idea for old space craft be a navigation beacon and such   why not if you can put them on    safe       pause    mode   why not have them be activate by a signal from a space craft man to act a a naviagtion beacon to take a directional plot on
 depends if you assume the existance of a work ssto like dc on billion would be enough to put about a quarter million pound of stuff on the moon if some of that mass go to send equipment to make lox for the transfer vehicle you could send a lot more either way it a lot more than need this prize big enough to warrent develop a ssto but it be enough to do it if the vehicle exists allen

 well it roll out two week ago a we speak it be at white sand get ready i would have call my source for the late but they be all out of town in nm a for the future there be at least 5m in next year budget for work on ssrt they sdio have be look for more fund and do seem to have some however sdio be not i repeat be not go to fund an orbital prototype the best we can hope from them be to 1 keep it alive for another year and 2 fund a suborbital vehicle which might with major modification just make orbit there be also some money for a set of prototype tank and project to answer a few more open question well news come from the new spacelifter effort the usaf manager of this program be very open to ssto and will have about 50m next year for study this would be enough to bring dc y to pdr now not all of this money will go to dc but a good case could be make for spending half on dc public support be still critical meet with your congressperson i ll help you do it and get his her support also call your local medium an get them to cover the flight test allen
 now i have put a wink at the end of my suggestion indicate it be intensely sarcastic i help it if everyone get all serious ross i never saw your original post it drop on the floor somewhere i just saw the trickle down thought it be intensely stupid not know anything about the joke mention arbitron and left it with an equally stupid joke bill in his ever increase devotion to thoroughness dug up several arbitron stats i myself think the arbitron stats be severely methodologically impaired but be a good measure of proportion i think anyone know how many people read news anymore
 in fact you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring nasa altogether the rocket be a commercial launch vechicle a conestoga fly a comet payload nasa be simply the primary customer i believe sdio have a small payload a well the advertising space be sell by the owner of the rocket who can do whatever they darn well please with it in addition these anonymous    observer    have no reason to be startle the deal make space news at least twice i think it only fair to find that out before everyone start have a hissy fit the fact that they bother to use the conditional tense suggests that it have not yet be approve
 in the air force world at least the crisis escalates when scale model of the plane in question i e about to be sacrifice begin to arrive in key senator and congresspersons office of course it be assume that coffee mug and other decorative junk have be try earlier spiros
 tom  s right about this only a grantable right if the granter have the will and the ability to stop anyone from take it away from you never mind the legal status nick  s right about this always easy to obtain forgiveness than permission not many people remember that britain  s king george iii expressly forbid his american subject to cross the alleghany appalachian mountain say subject basically say    stop u if you can    he how the usa start of course also how the bolivarian republic start ca 1800 1820 in central america it have quite the stay power of the usa sure there be more example of go far away and then ignore authority but none jump to mind right now or do a some whale nation do define whatever activity you want to carry out a    scientific research    which just coincidentally require the recovery of megatonnes of mineral or whatever then go at it lute keyser have just this sort of arrangement with libya i think in the late  70  s for his commercial space launch project one of the very early it be kill by soviet propaganda about nato cruise missile in africa which make libya renege on the arrangement

 the problem be you raise adequate amount of money that way the viking fund try they do succeed in a way but only because of the political impact of their fundraise the actual amount of money they raise be fairly inconsequential it would not have kept the viking lander go by itself

 forward from doug griffith magellan project manager magellan status report april 23 1993 1  the magellan spacecraft continue to operate normally gathering gravity data to plot the density variation of venus in the mid latitudes the solar panel offpoint be return to zero degree and spacecraft temperature drop 2 3 degree c  2  an end to end test of the delayed aerobraking data readout process be conduct this week in preparation for the transition experiment there be some difficulty lock up to the data frame and engineer be presently check whether the problem be in equipment at the track station 3  magellan have complete 7277 orbit of venus and be now 32 day from the end of cycle 4 and the start of the transition experiment 4  magellan scientist be participate in the brown vernadsky microsymposium at brown university in providence ri this week this joint meeting of u s  and russian venus researcher have be continue for many year
 it may be that they just mention it or that they actually thought about it i get the vague impression from their mission proposal that they take a very holistic aproach to the whole thing they seem to want to land people on the moon by the end of the decade without explain why or what they would do once they get there the only application i remember from the av week article be place a telescope on the moon great but they explain why it be do robotically but a _member_ besides bill i hang out with you
 well thank you dennis for your a usual highly detailed and informative post the question i have about the proton be could it be handle at one of ksc  s spare pad without major malfunction or could it be handle at kourou or vandenberg now if it us storables then how long would it take for the russian to equip something at cape york if proton be launch from a western site how would it compare to the t4 centaur a i see it it should lift very close to the t4

 i would guess not dr  neil gehrels of cgro be the son of dr  tom gehrels of the university of arizona since long have research interest in asteroid and other solar system astronomy tom be the one more likely to have discover a comet and thus have his name attach to it tom gehrels be a leader in the spacewatch project which have recently increase mankind  s discovery rate on near earth asteroid find a couple every month for much more on this interest guy read his autobiography  on a glassy sea
 i might suggest give the management some more mumble time by ask the very lead question in two or three part what be your long term expectation of space market what project specifically be they funding by internal fund and at what level and what competition do you expect in this area this last point be always worth hit upper management with    gently    if you want them to think and a hard a you can if you have a good case that there really be competion
 prb access digex com pat pontificate what i be get at in my post be whether or not it might be possible to put enough brain on board future deep space probe for them to automatically avoid such thing a look at the sun or go into an uncontrolled tumble i heard once that the voyager have a failsafe routine built in that essentially say    if you never hear from earth again here  s what to do    this be a back up in the event a receiver burnt out but the probe could still send data limited but still some data since this would be a shutdown that may never be refund for startup if some type of cosmic bem take out the probe it might not be such a big loss obviously you plan for everything but the most obvious thing can be consider

 nsmca so some of my idea be a bit odd off the wall and such but nsmca so be wilbur and orville wright and quite a few others   this be a common misconception there be nothing    off the wall    about the wright brother they be in correspondance with a number of other experimenter octave chanute lillienthal etc they flew model they have a wind tunnel in short they be quite mainstream and be not regard a odd or eccentric by the community i suggest you read the bishop  s boy or the biography by harry gate comb i can never remember which it be    the guy that have the fbos and own learjet for a while these be both in print and easily obtainable the bishop  s boy be in trade paperback even even well would be the multi volume set of the wright writing but this be out of print rare and hideously expensive

 when the lunar society  s 500m estimate of the cost of a lunar colony be mention at make orbit somebody ask jerry pournelle    have you talk to bill gate    the answer    yes he say that if he be go to sink that much money into it want to run it    and he have the time    somebody then ask him about perot answer    have ross perot on your board may be a big problem than not have the money

 i be suggest that the minority of professional and amateur astronomer have the right to a dark uncluttered night sky let me give you an example when you watch tv they have commercial to pay for the program you accept that a part of watch if you like it you can turn it off if you want to view the night sky and there be a float billboard out there you turn it off the same reason that limit billboard in scenic area george call a democracy the majority rule sorry if ytou like it i suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to dark sky the theory of government here be that the majority rule except in the nature of fundamental civil right i say any reasonably in depth perusal of american history will show you that many wasp have continued the practice of prejudice discrimination and violence against others of different race religion and belief despite the law if you really be annoyed get some legislation to create a dark sky zone where in all light emission be protect in the zone kind of like the national radio quiet zone do you know about that near teh radio telescope observatory in west virginia they have a 90 mile emcon zone theoretically they can prevent you from run light ac motor like air conditioner and vacuum in practice they use it mostly to control large radio user i say what object to here be a float billboard that presumably would move around in the sky i for one be against legislate at all i just wish that people have a bit of common courtesy and would consider how their greed for money impact the more ethereal and aesthetic value that make u human this include the need for wild and unspoiled thing include the night sky george

 the problem with commercial titan be that mm have make little or no attempt to market it basically happy with their government business and want to have to learn how to sell commercially a secondary problem be that it be a bit big need to go after multi satellite launch a la ariane and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly they also have some problem with launch facility at just the wrong time to get them start properly if memory serf the pad use for the mar observer launch have just come out of heavy refurbishment work that have prevent launch from it for a year or so there have be a few ct launch mar observer be one of them so be that strand intelsat and at least one of it brother that reach orbit properly
 you totally forgot the original post that you post allen in that post you state that the    wrap    be on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in this post you finally admit that this be not true come your little ol bun down here and you will find out who be do what and who be work on integration this be simply an ad hominum attack and you know it of course there be a fee it be for administration geez allen any organization have cost but there be a heck of a difference in legitimate cost such a library and other thing that must be there to support a program and    wrap    a you originally state it you state that wrap be on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentence down you say be not true which be it allen a you have post on this subject allen you state that wrap be over and above overhead and be a seperate charge you admit here that this be wrong nasa have a line item budget every year i have see it allen get some number from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap number and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you be barking in the wind integration could be do well at the center apollo integration be do here at msfc and that do not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston be totally wrong allen there you have a bunch of people who be completely remove from the work that they be try to oversee there be no way that will ever work it have never work in any large scale project that it be ever try on could you imagine a reston like set up for apollo oh you be full of it allen on this one i agree that jsc screw up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that cause it replace to make a stupid statement like that just show how deep your bias go come to msfc for a couple of week and you will find out just how wrong you really be maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the fact be contrary to it i agree that integration be the single most important part of a successful large scale effort what i completly disagree with be seperating that integration function from the people that be do the work it be call leadership allen that be what make apollo work final responsibility for the success of apollo be held by less than 50 people that be leadership and responsibility there be neither when you have any organization set up a reston be you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do a much well job why do it take a year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they be on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there be one heck of a lot i do not know allen but one thing i do know be that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shamble for year do you it be lack of responsibility and leadership that be the program problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at reston nasa be only a symptom of a great national problem you be so narrowly focus in your effort that you do not see this no i be say that if they be locate at jsc it never would have happen in the first place i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that be at reston be on site at jsc the problem never would have happen totally ignore the lack of leadership of congress this many head hydra that have grown up at nasa be the true problem of the agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias be only indicative of your position

 suppose the soviet have manage to get their moon rocket work and have make it first they could have beaten u if either their rocket blown up on the pad thus set them back and or a saturn v go boom if they have beaten u i speculate that the u would have go head and do some landing but we also would have be more determine to set up a base both in earth orbit and on the moon whether or not we would be on mar by now would depend upon whether the soviet try to go set up a lunar base would have stretch the budget of both nation and i think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of go to mar at least in the short run thus we would have concentrate on the moon
 if not mistaken this be the usual sort of precaution against loss of communication that timer be counting down continuously if it ever hit zero that mean galileo heard from earth in a suspiciously long time and it may be galileo  s fault     so time to go into a fallback mode that minimizes chance of spacecraft damage and maximizes chance of restore contact i know exactly what all galileo do in such a situation but a common example be to switch receiver on the theory that maybe the one listen with have die

 we be not at the end of the space age but only at the end of it begin that space exploration be no longer a driver for technical innovation or a focus of american cultural attention be certainly debatable however technical development in other quarter will always be examine for possible application in the space area and we can look forward to many innovation that might enhance the capability and low the cost of future space operation the dream be alive and well

 forward from the mar observer project mar observer status report april 23 1993 10 00 be pdt flight sequence c8 be active the spacecraft subsystem and instrument payload perform well in array normal spin and outer cruise configuration with uplink and downlink via the high gain antenna uplink at 125 bps downlink at the 2 k engineering data rate a a result of the spacecraft enter contingency mode on april 9 all payload instrument be automatically power off by on board fault protection software gamma ray spectrometer random access memory be successfully reload on monday april 19  to prepare for magnetometer calibration which be reschedule for execution in flight sequence c9 on tuesday and wednesday of next week a reload of payload data system random access memory will take place this morning begin at 10 30 be over this weekend the flight team will send real time command to perform differential one way range to obtain additional data for analysis by the navigation team radio science ultra stable oscillator test will take place on monday the flight sequence c9 uplink will occur on sunday april 25 with activation at midnight monday even april 26  c9 have be modify to include magnetometer calibration which could not be perform in c8 due to contingency mode entry on april 9  these magnetometer instrument calibration will allow the instrument team to well characterize the spacecraft generated magnetic field and it effect on their instrument this information be critical to martian magnetic field measurement which occur during approach and mapping phase mag cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of array normal spin state and perform slew and roll maneuver to provide the mag team data point in vary spacecraft attitude and orientation
 i be assume that there be a moon base unless it make a profit actually if it do well that give a large gnp which lead to be able to spend more money on your military include gosh wow space stuff assume profitable rather than pay for itself you might be able to _run_ one for that put it there hardly why do you think at least a couple century before there will be significant commerical activity on the moon
 mcdonnell douglas roll out dc x     ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization    which paid 60 million for the dc x    itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundred of million require for this be a little peculiar way of put it sdio  s budget this year be what 3 4 billion they _could_ fund all of the dc development out of one year budget of course they do have other iron in the fire and launcher development be not their primary purpose but the dc development could a easily be paid for by divert that money a by divert the comparable sts ops budget     oh and before the flame start i applaud the sdio for funding dc x devlopment and i hope it work and no launcher development be not nasa primary goal either imho they be suppose to provide the enable technology research for others to do launcher development and secondarily operate such launcher a they require but just me

 fred try reading a bit the government do lot of multi year contract with penalty for cancellation clause they just like to be damn sure they know what they be do before they sign a multi year contract the reason they cut defense spending a much a they would like be the reagan administration sign enough multi year contract that now cheaper to just finish them out look at ssf this year funding be 2 2 billion 1 8 of which will cover penalty clause due to the re design

 the gravity data be collect in real time and it not record to the tape recorder however you only need to collect the gravity every 3rd or 4th orbit so there be no real data loss if the moon block transmission for a short while
 ether implodes 2 earth core be gravity this paper both describes how heavenly body can be stationary ether suck structure and why we observe    orbital    motion ether the theoretical propogation medium of electro magnetic wave be conclude not to exist base on the result of the michelson moreley experiment conduct a century ago i propose that those conclusion be flaw base on the fact that the experiment be design to look for a flow parallel to the earth  s surface not perpindicular due to the prevail assumption that the earth travel through the ether a a ball through the wind the reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought could have ramification of biblical proportion through out the world remember einstien say imagination be great than knowledge 1 i dream like this ether base reality the ether be like a fluid out of phase with our reality creation start a a lattice place into the ether give a spin the lattice both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it convert it distil localize mass time and energy non spinning lattice    dark matter    the earth exactly spin around the sun picture an image of a galaxy we any video of them spin picture u be stationary and the sun  s image be drag across the sky by the spin ether field picture an onion each layer of which be spin a little faster than the next a thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretch diagonally sideways it head be in a faster shell than it tail until it finally intersect the ground of the inner kernel it direction vector be straight down but it    foot print    be a line not a point sunrise sunset the moon exactly orbit u it be a parasite non self spin sustain be drag in the earth  s ether field which be itself in the sun  s much more powerful field our season be the wobble of earth  s axis like a top slow down the    orbit    of the earth around the sun be all of the star image be drag around by the sun  s ether feild the earth moon and sun be about the same size and    distance    apart it just that the time between them varies greatly because the    path    be not the same the moon  s lattice in the ether be like stick a fork in a plate of spaghetti and give the plate a half turn the sun  s lattice have so much spin that it like the fork have get the whole plate of noodle wound up the piece of light go to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a    j    hook at the end the piece of light go to the sun have to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it get there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about a big a    earth  s    shadow upon it and at other time totally eclipse the sun look in the sky except for your knowledge would you guess that they be about the same size just because they look about the same size o e o o o s e m or m s the full moon quarter moon etc be the difference between rate of ether spin what we be look at be a rotate    turntable view    of the moon only half of which be face the sun see a half moon within about 120 degree of sky of the sun during the day try and draw that    earth shadow    it only the moon  s image which appear to orbit u no matter where it be the light part be the part face the sun and the dark part be the half face away from the sun even when it appear to be behind u    light year    between galaxy be a misnomer the distance be closer to zero a time and matter be characteristic of this phase of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion define edge 0 ether spin what we be see could be essentially happen now the    piece    of light may have experienced many year but the trip could be very quick our time to time travel or warp space i might consider learn to de spin myself phase out my mass good luck try to design a propulsion system to drag around a space time locality it like try to move a balloon by shoot a squirt gun from within to find out about all of this i recommend study history look in the book of life or holy grail etc brain wave just might carry decipherable data start look on some part of the spectrum say to be unusable due to all the background noise 4  billion human totally isolate myself record me think dog backwards and learn to read what i get microsoft holy grail card for pentium next conclude that my thought be record on a non time bound medium the ether and that it be i who move forward in time i would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which start look for a flow opposite magnetism pole to pole why not perhaps by passing a large flat dc current through a two foot diameter coil or choke or something and see what i could get with my machine  s receiver next to it if you think live to see it consider this quit put the reproductive key of other life in your body all of life  s data could be write on the wind ether not just our thought dna could be a little receiver or file access

the little one who look different be a sub species meant to provide service he carefully combed through history rewrite it in his favor pull like a weed anything that compromise his control he entice recruit by send them his vision say that there be immortality at the end of the road for only twelve soul kill or be kill the amount of control he could exert be finite though a at every change he make a void would appear in our reality the universe one day end 100 meter from u it seem odd but we remember how else it should be then some of the twelve be no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stop just beyond his fingertip he step through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he have create i make a few more change and lose my body exist only on the wind

he can direct you to cross path with your old self and vanish a you rewrite your own course of history none the wiser a we pas the point along the parallel line where he step back in time his

 be to three talk in the last month which might be of interest transcribed some of my note below since my note take ability be by no mean infallible please assume that all factual error be mine permission be grant to copy this without restriction note for newbie the delta clipper project be gear towards produce a single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle the dc x vehicle be a 1 3 scale vehicle design to test some of the concept invovled in ssto it be currently undergo test the dc y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reach orbit it have not yet be fund on april 6th rocky nelson of macdonnell douglas give a talk entitle    optimize technique for advanced space mission    here at the university of illinois mr nelson  s job involves use software to simulate trajectory and determine the optimal trajectory within give requirement although he be not directly involve with the delta clipper project he have spent time with them recently use his software for their application he thus use the dc y project for most of his example while i think the detail of implicit trajectory simulation be of much interest to the reader i hope they i fell asleep during that part i think that many of you will be interested in some of the detail glean from the example the first example give be the maximization of payload for a polar orbit the main restriction be that acceleration must remain below 3 g i assume that this be driven by passenger constraint rather than hardware constraint but i do not verify that the delta clipper y version have 8 engine 4 booster and 4 sustainer the booster which have a low isp be shut down in mid flight thus one critical question be when to shut them down mr nelson show the follow plot of acceleration v time ______ 3 g    a ascii graph go this be actually fairly good the big difference be that the line 2 g    make by the should be curve which be concave up the data be only approximate a the graph up for very long 1 g 0 g  100 sec  400 sec a mention before a critical constraint be that g level must be kept below 3  initially all eight engine be start a the vehicle burn fuel the accelleration increase a it get close to 3g the booster engine be throtled back however they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon make more sense to cut them off altogether this cause the dip in accelleration at about 100 second eventually the remain sustainer engine bring the g level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely the engine cutoff do not acutally occur in orbit the trajectory be aim for an altitude slightly high than the 100nm desire and the last vestige of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lower the final altitude to that desire question from the audience paraphrase q would it make sense to shut down the booster engine in pair rather than all at once a very perceptive worth consider they have not yet do the simulation shut down all four be part of the problem a give q so what be the final payload for this trajectory a tell u    read aviation leak    he also apparently have a good propulsion example but be told not to use it my question do anyone know if this security be due to sdio protect national security or md protect their own interest the second example be reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver the big constraint in this one be aerodynamic heating and the parameter they be try to maximize be crossrange he show graph of heating use two different model to show that both be very similar and i think we be suppose to assume that this meant they be very accurate the end result be that for a polar orbit land at ksc the dc y would have about 30 degree of crossrange and would start reentry profile about 60 degree south latitude i would have ask about the land maneuver but he know about that aspect of the flight profile
 my understand be that the  expected error be basically know bug in the warn system software thing be checked that have the right value in yet because they set till after launch and suchlike rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bug they just tell the crew  ok if you see a warn no 213 before liftoff ignore it good grief and i thought the shuttle software be know for be well engineered if this be actually the case every member of the program team should be take out and shot give that heard the shuttle software rat a level 5 in maturity i strongly doubt that this be the case
 very cost effective if you use the right accounting method sherzer methodology hell yes not go to let a bunch of seven suit tell me what the right way to estimate cost effectiveness be at least not until they can make their mind up long enough to leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two seriously though if you be to ask the british government whether their colonisation effort in the america be cost effective what answer do you think get what if you ask in 1765 1815 1865 1915 and 1945 respectively
 on a fact finding mission try to find out if there exists a list of potentially world bearing star within 100 light year of the sun     be anyone currently work on this sort of thing thanks     dan    in principle any star resemble the sun mass luminosity might have planet locate in a suitable orbit there several within 100 ly of the sun they be single star for double or multiple system might be troublesome there  s a list locate at ames arc nasa gov somewhere in pub space i think it be call stars dat by the way what kind of project if i may know rui        infinity be at hand rui sousa     if yours be big enough grab it ruca saber si pt

 why must it be a u government space launch pad directly i mean   i know of a few that could launch a small package into space not include ariadne and the russian sites   i know    poker flat    here in alaska thou use to be only sound rocket for auroral borealous sp and other northern atmospheric item be at last i heard be upgraded to be able to put sattelites into orbit why must people in the u be fix on use nasa direct resource poker flat be runin part by nasa but also by the univesity of alaska and the geophysical institute sound like typical u cultural centralism and protectionism   and people wonder why we have the multi trillion dollar deficite sp yes i be work on a spell checker
 if comet shoemaker levy 1993e be in jovian orbit and if the comet be still hang around when galileo arrives then sure it will be add to the list of target have by then over two year of earth based observation to help narrow down the position of the piece of the comet it probably be too much different than what be do with gaspra galileo do not image toutatis that come from earth based radar
 i have receive my copy of cosmonautics 1990 and cosmonautics 1991 a well a soviet space 1990 and space station mir handbook from aerospace ambassador with no problem get ready to fax them some material in huntsville and i  ll include a printout of your inquiry ____________________________________________________________

 wow i be begin to think that i have make that up i remember that movie it be about 1 5 hour long i think they end up anywhere in the know universe i remember they get a message halfway out to proxima centauri that earth transmit a day after they launch time to catch up with them at the halfway point i thought it be neat i think i be all of 10 at the time space 1999 have just come out with 4 episode release in american store i will look for the into infinity show i never do know that be the name of it i thought the show be call    the day after tomorrow    and that be it
 afraid i give any more info on this   and hop someone in greter netland have some detail a short story in the newspaper a few day ago make some sort of mention about how the japanese use what sound like a gravity assist have just manage to crash or crash land a package on the moon the article be very vague and unclear and to make matter bad i clip it do this jog anyone  s memory
 okay here be what i have so far have a group any size preferibly small but send a human be to the moon set up a habitate and have the human s spend one earth year on the moon do that mean no resupply or need to find atleast 1billion for prize money contest open to different class of participant new mexico state have semi challenged university of alaska any branch to put a team together and to do it   any other university college institute of high learn wish to make a counter challenge or challenge another school say it here i like the idea of have atleast a russian team some prefer use new technology others old or    the basic idea of the new moon race be like the solar car race acrossed australia   atleast in that basic vein of endevour   any other suggestion

 a an amateur radio operator vhf 2metres i like to keep up with what be go up and for that matter what be come down too in about 30 day i have learn alot about satellite current future and past all the way back to vanguard series and up to astro d observatory space i borrow a book from the library call weater satellite i think it have a photo of the earth with a tiro type satellite on it i would like to build a model or have a large color poster of one of the tiro satellite i think there be place in the usa that sell them itos be my favorite look satellite follow by amsat oscar 13 ao 13 ttyl 73 jim
      if that be true go for it   i have a few friend who we could pool our resource and do it   maybe make it a prize kind of liek the    solar car race    in australia   anybody game for a contest
 but allen if you can assume the existence of an ssto there be no need to have the contest in the first place i would think that what we want to get out of the contest be the development of some of these  cheaper way of do thing if they already exist why flush 1g just to get someone to go to the moon for a year       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden
 somebody mention a re boost of hst during this mission meaning that weight be a very tight margin on this mission i heard any hint of a re boost or that any be need why not grapple do all say fix bolt a small liquid fuel thruster module to hst then let it make the re boost it have to be cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle a a tug nasty dirty combustion product people have go to monumental effort to keep hst clean we certainly go to bolt any thruster to it
 you have miss something there be a big difference between be in the same plane and in exactly the same state position and velocity equal in addition to this there have always be redundancy propose bob
 be follow discussion about the delta clipper program and i have one small question a i understand it the dc x derive orbital vehicle dc y 1 be to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways not completely nose first so why be the dc y look symmetric in every draw see i would think that an asymmetric design sort of like wingless orbiter may work well since less shield be require on the top side can anybody explain ken kobayashi kkobayas husc harvard edu
 this inherently bad this really light pollution since it will only be visible shortly before or after dusk or during the day of course if night only last 2 hour for you probably go to be inconvienenced but inconvienenced anyway in that case finally this the bronze age and most of u indo european those people speak indo eurpoean language often have much non indo european ancestry and cultural background so please try to remember that there be more human activity than those practice by the warrior caste the farm caste and the priesthood and why act distressed that someone  s found a way to do research that involve socialism it certianly mean we deserve to die

 i should probably re post this with another title so that the guy on the other thread would see that this be a practical use of    temporary orbit        another possible temporary orbit
 hello everyone i be hop someone could help me out write a program for my astronautics class for assent of the shuttle into a low orbit there be two thing like to know first how much time elapses between launch and the pitch over second what be the cross sectional area of the shuttle srb  s and ext tank thanks for any information post or e mail
 what in blaze be go on with wayne matson and gang down in alabama i also heard an unconfirmed rumor that aerospace ambassador have disappear can anyone else confirm
 i doubt there be good prospect for a self armor system for venus surface condition several hundred degree very high pressure of co2 possibly sulfuric and nitric acid or oxide but it be a notion to consider for outer planet r where you might pick up ice under less extream upper atmosphere condition buying deeper penetration a nice creative idea unlikly but worthy of think about

 from article c5owcb n3p world std com by tombaker world std com tom a baker my understand be that the  expected error be basically know bug in the warn system software thing be checked that have the right value in yet because they set till after launch and suchlike rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bug they just tell the crew  ok if you see a warn no 213 before liftoff ignore it
 well let see      i take a class on this last fall and i have no note so i  ll try to wing it     here  s how i understand it remember from stellar evolution that black hole and neutron star pulsar be form from high mass star m star  1 4m sun high mass star live fast and burn hard take appoximately 10 5 10 7 year before go nova or supernova in this time they live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane so any of these if assume to be the source of grb  s will be in the plane of the galaxy then we take the catalog of burst that have be recieved from the various satellite around the solar system pioneer venus have one either pion 10 or 11 ginga and of course batse and we do distribution test on our catalog these test all show that the burst have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show sign of homogeneity i e they do not clump in any one direction so unless we be sample the area inside the disk of the galaxy we be sample the universe not cool if you want to figure out what the hell cause these thing now i suppose you be say    well we stil only may be sample from inside the disk    well not necessarily remember we have what be more or less an interplanetary network of burst detector with a baseline that go waaaay out to beyond pluto pioneer 11 so we should be able with all of our detector de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite here  s an analogy you see a plane overhead you measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system one of your friend a mile away see the same plane and measure the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system which be the same a yours the two angle be different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe find a source to my knowledge no one have be able to do this i should throw in why halo and corona model work also a i say before look at the possible astrophysics of the burst short timescales high energy black hole and pulsar exhibit much of this type of behavior if this be the case a i say before these star seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these source when you look at a simulated model where the burst be confine to the disk but you sample out to large distance say 750 mpc you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clump of source in the direction of the galactic center a i say before there be none of these characteristic
 i know a whole lot on proton but give that it be a multi stage rocket up to 4 stage it may not really need the centaur plus it may end up seriously beating on say centaur also the centaur be not small unless the proton have an oversize shroud you may not be able to get the centaur in under it dennis you know much about this
 christian slater only gota cameo on st6 and besides maybe she act
 thanks for the information i assume p be the semi major axis and e the eccentricity the peri  helion and aphelion be then give by p 1 e and p 1 e i e  about 2 90 and 3 95 au respectively for jupiter they be 4 95 and 5 45 au if 1977 be after the temporary capture this mean that the comet end up in an orbit that come no closer than 1 au to jupiter  s    which i take to be a rough indication of how far from jupiter it could get under jupiter  s influence where 1 jupiter radius 71 000 km 44 000 mi 0 0005 au so the 1970 figure seem unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove be that the case for the 1973 figure a well    mark brader softquad inc  toronto    remember the golgafrinchans    utzoo sq msb msb sq com    pete granger

 nasa headquarters distribute the follow press release today 4 6 typed it in verbatim for you folk to chew over many of the topic recently discuss on sci space be cover in this gibbon outline space station redesign guidance dr  john h  gibbon director office of science and technology policy outline to the members designate of the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 3 three budget option a guidance to the committee in their deliberation on the redesign of the space station a low option of 5 billion a mid range option of 7 billion and a high option of 9 billion will be consider by the committee each option would cover the total expenditure for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include fund for development operation utilization shuttle integration facility research operation support transition cost and also must include adequate program reserve to insure program implementation within the available fund over the next 5 year 4 billion be reserve within the nasa budget for the president  s new technology investment a a result station option above 7 billion must be accompany by offset reduction in the rest of the nasa budget for example a space station option of 9 billion would require 2 billion in offset from the nasa budget over the next 5 year gibbon present the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee generally the members designate focus upon administrative topic and use the session to get acquaint they also receive a legal and ethic briefing and an orientation on the process the station redesign team be follow to develop option for the advisory committee to consider gibbon also announce that the united state and it international partner    the european japanese and canadian    have decide after consultation to give    full consideration    to use of russian asset in the course of the space station redesign process to that end the russian will be ask to participate in the redesign effort on an as needed consult basis so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assess the capability of mir and the possible use of mir and other russian capability and system the u s  and international partner hope to benefit from the expertise of the russian participant in assess russian system and technology the overall goal of the redesign effort be to develop option for reduce station cost while preserve key research and exploration capability careful integration of russian asset could be a key factor in achieve that goal gibbon reiterate that    president clinton be commit to the redesign space station and to make every effort to preserve the science the technology and the job that the space station program represent however he also be commit to a space station that be well manage and one that do not consume the national resource which should be use to invest in the future of this industry and this nation
 the apollo fire be harsh a saturn v explosion would have be hurtful but the soviet win would have be crush that could have be  the  technological turn point for the u turn u from today  s    we can do anything  the  super power    to a much more reserve attitude like the soviet program today kennedy be go by 68  69 the war be still on be the east i think the program would have stall badly and the goal of the moon by 70 would have be dead with nasa try to figure be they go wrong i speulate that  the saturn program would have be push into the 70 with cost over run that would just be too evil nixon still win  the shuttle be never propose and skylab never built  by 73 the program stall yet again under the fuel crisis  a string of small launch mark the mid seventy  by 76 the goal of a u man on the moon be dead and the u space program drift till the present day
 well if go to get upset with this you might a well direct some of this moral outrage towards glavcosmos a well they pioneer this capitalist application of booster advert long before nasa sign of the time a sony logo on a soyuz launcher     this sound like something lowell wood would think of do anyone know if involve this may be the purpose for the university of colorado people my guess be that the purpose for the livermore people be to learn how to build large inflatable space structure if this be true i think a great idea learn how to build to build structure in space in an essential step towards space development and give that freedom appear to be shrink towards the vanish point i question whether nasa  s space station be go to provide much if any knowledge in this area especially if a design such a faget  s wingless orbiter be chosen     if such a project also monitor ozone depletion and demonstrates creative use of partial private sector funding in the process    so much the well and do anyone have any more detail other than what be in the wn news blip how serious be this project be this just in the    wild idea    stage or do it have real funding not yet though if this project go through i suppose the return of jeremy rifkin be inevitable        _______________________________________________________________________________

 speech by pete worden deliver before the u s  space foundation conference colorado spring colorado april 15 1993 what a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble for provide me this forum i would sincerely like to thank the u s  space foundation my topic today be the single stage rocket technology rocket or ssrt by i intend to speak of more how to low the cost and make rapid progress ssrt be to my mind    and i hope to convince you    the erupt a new rally cry for our generation in space    faster cheaper and well faster cheaper well and ssrt represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another it be a new thing to be sure    but it be also a relearn of old thing from past master when we roll out the ssrt baby two week ago so call expert told u it violates the law of physic    it make no sense for example dr  eberhart rachtin former president of the aerospace corp  say of ssrt in the l a  time that it    defies the best principle of launch payload into space    well dr  rachtin    make u mad what be these principle that ssrt defies well i  ll tell you it violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware it violates the    fact    that it take 20 year to build something new and it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billion of dollar it take some of the last generation  s expert to teach u some new old lesson werhner von braun  s first rocket be not a saturn v  general schriever  s icbm  s take ten year to demonstrate and the x 1 airplane cost 1 billion it take one of the great engineer of the 1950  s to remind u of these truth    max hunter max to remind you be a senior engineer in the thor irbm program and old faster well cheaper success story max have be persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960  s because he knew it have to be do in affordable step build a little test a little next he persuade u to do a technology demonstration we solicit a bunch of requirement    just change every few year anyway not include in the speech    the als nls have such ephemeral requirement that it would well know a    shape shifter    than    space lifter    we spend a lot money    this x rocket only cost 60 million when  s the last time we even built a new airplane for that and it take a lot of time to build    mcdonnell douglas complete it in 18 month finally the government program office consist of one very over worked air force major    motivate in part by the threat that get to ride on it in a strapped on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule a i described what ssrt be    and keep in mind it only a first step there be several more step    and step that can easily fail    before the u s  can field an ssto but each step should follow the same principle    a small management team    a few year technology demonstration    and a modest budget let me show a few detail on ssrt and how it might evolve see chart embarrass when my generation be compare with the last generation    the giant of the last great space era the 1950 s and 1960  s they go to the moon we built a telescope that see straight they soft landed on mar the least we could do be soft land on earth but we do have an answer we can follow their build a little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space i know there be nay sayers among you    those who say ssrt be a stunt it need more thermal protection the engine be wrong it would be well to land horizontally etc etc i say to you    see you at white sand in june you bring your view graphs and i  ll bring my rocketship if we do what we say we can do then you let u do the next step not include in the speech if we fail    you still have your program office staff summary sheet requirement analysis and decade long program
 why paul obvious once chlorine chemistry have be ban on earth a be be advocate by some group ti price will well there already be a sulfate process for tio2 purification the chlorine process be cleaner however and for that reason be achieve dominance in the marketplace darn caught by the white hot heat of technological progress again     most ti be use in pigment btw a the oxide where it replace white lead pigment some decade ago very little be reduce to the metal spoilsport hence the need for increase fashion emphasis on anodise ti jewelry     seriously say there be a flaw in gary  s analysis in that he assumes an export orient economy maybe the lunatic will just want some native ti for local use     which merely evades the issue of why those lunatic be there at all and why their child would want to stay i do not evade the issue at all i clearly state that this would be from diabolical foresight in establish a shelter industrial base for the upcoming great war very cost effective if you use the right accounting method
 the centaur that be be built for t4 would be a well bet to integrate onto the proton a the t4 centaur be design for the extremely harsh envorinment of the t4 launch it be also closer to 4 m in diameter hit on the real kicker however the centaur be pressure stabilize it can not hold up it own weight without pressure in the tank additionally the pressure difference between the two tank must be maintain to      5 psi that be rather tight to be rock and roll on the train the pressure stabilization be how centaur achieves the performance on numerous occasion when i be there 88 91 the af want to see what it would take to make a non pressure stabilize centaur the answer    a centaur not worth launch the atlas centaur do not require on pad integration however the t4 centaur do i believe the on pad integration be to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirement and pfl configuration so maybe something can be do there            the addition of lox lh facility be critical a the centaur top off a it lift off a lhe facility be also need i know what the proton us for fuel but since they be derive from icbm  s i would suspect that they use storable propellant which have the ullage problem that cryo  s do if there be no cryo at the sight at all the addition of these system could be big not to mention the real tech transfer issue involve with provide centaur gse to russia that issue alone might be enough to kill this idea

 there be an interest opinion piece in the business section of today s la time thursday april 15 1993 p  d1 i thought post it to stir up some flame war i mean reason debate let me preface it by say that i largely agree that the    space age    in the romantic sense of several decade ago be over and that project like the space station miss the point at this time reading for example    what  s new    the weekly physic update we get here on the net clear that the romance of the day lie in the ever more fine grained manipulation of matter by which i include biotechnology condense matter physic with it spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere and the amaze thing people be do with individual atom these day to a large extent i think the romance some people still have with space be a matter of nostalgia i feel sure that someday we or more precisely our    mind child    will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out but i think that  manned  space exploration be not what be excite about what we can do  now  anyway let me quote some of this article but not all     space age glory fade from view micheal schrage writer consultant and research associate at mit at 35 america  s space age have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis the reason be that the space age be already dead the technology no longer define our time and the public have grown weary of the multibillion  dollar celestial investment that yield minimal psychic or economic reward space exploration have mutate from a central focuse of america  s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue speace be not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our technology infrastructure discussion or even our defense conversion policy to be sure america should continue to invest in satellite technology for telecommunication and remote sense cheap deep space probe would be nice too but the ideal of space a a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation be now dead        before the change in administration it would have be foolish to write an obituary for the space age the bush white house aggressively support the space program and propose spending well over 30 billion to build space station freedom alone even a he propose budget cut in other science and technology domain office of management and budget director richard darman be an outspoken public champion of big ticket space expenditure the reality that much of the civilian space program from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station be poorly conceive and unimpressively implement do not seem to matter much political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism not a coherent vision or cost effective sensibility determine multibillion dollar space budget indeed with few notable exception such a voyager the post apollo era be the story of the gold plated porkification of space exploration with program and promise that deliver less for more and more         while the clinton administration have kept on the highly regard daniel goldin a administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration it seem clear that space exploration be not be position a either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america s technological prowess the space station budget have rightly be slash space be virtually ignore when the administration champion it competitiveness agenda

 i once thought it would be easy fitting a sine to the time but not this give discrepancy of upto six minute if you fit a sine series get a very good fit after just three or four term though this presumably have to do with the eccentricity of the earth orbit
 if i read you right say in essence that with a large economy nation will have more discretionary fund to  waste  on a lunar facility that be certainly partially the case with apollo but real lunar colony will probably require a continue military scientific or commercial reason for be rather than just a    we have the money why not    approach conceivable that luna will have a military purpose possible that luna will have a commercial purpose but most likely that luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred year at least therefore lunar base should be predicate on funding level little different from those found for antarctic base can you put a 200 person base on the moon for 30 million a year even if you use grad student gary
 not very impressed by the old so called    prospect    work from lpi it have almost all be gear towards industrially silly process on the moon a an excuse to put astronaut there     translation it support the nick szabo vision of the future to which you must subscribe     fred all support what each of u think should be do to some degree if you have a problem with what nick think should be do address it instead of just complain about his do so you really get what the  complaints be about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaint     something between feeling regard nick  s method and judgment about his meaning t f     fred  s issue 1 nick  s allege trash of others     i only get it when you stop trash and make your point patently instead of  allegorically that be my point all along fred i see we be deal with a problem in a conflict of interpretation not least of which be your belief that only you can adequately judge what be and be not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point why you take a poll fred if you want some psuedo objective point of view and a usual you defend your insult with    he start it       yeah i take some of his research and call it my own but he start it       so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first    besides that i think still open to interpretation whether nick actually do start it so your defense besides be lame and contradict the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrow tool    i never borrow it i already give it back and it be broken when you give it to me    make up yer mind fred first i try to address what i think you meant for which i be reward with a denial of sort and a smart remark then i point out that i be not clear what you do mean rather than risk your childish ire wrongly interpret you a second time and stupid for it i just win can i fred get a great point here somewhere just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guard of your valuable opinion you never actually get around to make it     fred issue 2 nick  s allege meaning     too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick  s or you would have a really good point instead you have provide a good reason to ignore your insult since they be base on incorrect interpretation that you have make about others forgive me for give your insult more meaning than they ever should have have my reading of what nick actually say be that    people require in all part of all space process    so your take issue with his opinion regard people in the space program i read a    people be require in all part of all space process    so help me out here fred since so patently stupid do you read nick wrong or be you go to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope one of those cheeto and string model that all the computer mag have be rave about the point be _i_ be not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption only be stupid if i insult you for have make it but ala your job fred and finally your style be confuse since you try to make two point simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point address a  plan  that only exist in your mind and the other take issue with behavior that you do a much a anyone no no i finally get it you like the plan that nick  s post make you imagine and you like nick  s obnoxious behavior even though no bad than your own thanks for take the time with someone a dense a myself of course socrates how could it be otherwise who care who come on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i be on for about 2 year if you have see me on the net first remember when nick and i go down exactly the same road regard rude unneccesary behavior just amaze to me that you continue to take issue with behavior no bad than your own let  s see here my complaint about your obnoxious behavior be hypocritical while your flame against people you decide be flamers and my complaint about your name calling be immature while your name calling yeah right maybe if you call me some more name i might see it well fred    net ghod wannabe    naturally fred correctly interpret my motivation when yours be impossible to judge from your action a your insult of people that try prof i really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really want be to impress everyone i only put my complaint with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because i thought you be such a jerk that bring it back to the net play right into my hand ala i have no idea what an intellectual master you be turn table and bring the history of these post to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me whether i should feel stupid because i try to make suggestion to such a superior intellect or becuase i try to communicate like an adult with a self righteous as still clear well fred you expose me now i  ll never be able to get a nother job with nasa since they all know that stupider than fred mccall well i just hope happy please leave me alone now i just have the heart to attempt keep up with one so far above me maybe nick or pat can approach your high standard but drop it now  tommy mac

 assume that their normal rotation carry all area of the surface into sunlight not so even on earth each pole get several week without sunlight in mid winter pluto and charon have much more extreme axial tilt and a much longer orbit pluto  s north pole for example get over a century of darkness follow by over a century of perpetual light at the moment in luck    pluto and charon be just past their equinox when the sun be just on the horizon at both pole of each if we get probe there soon only the immediate vicinity of one pole on each will be in long term shadow this will get steadily bad the longer we wait

 need to launch hlvs to send up large amount of stuff  if  you assume no new launcher development if you assume new launcher development with low cost a a specific objective then you probably want to build something hlv sized anyway
 i once read an article on computer technology which state that every new computer technology be actually low and slow then what it replace silicon be less effective then the germanium product then available gaas be less capable then silicon multi processors be slow then existent single processor what the argument be though be that these new technology promise either theoretically future high performance or low cost or high density i think that the dc 1 may g fit into this same model elv  s can certainly launch more weight then a ssrt but an ssrt offer the prospect of great cycle time and low cost this be kind of a speculative post but i thought throw it out a a hjistorical framework for those interested in the project
 hey my dad have an old hangar and judy have some old rocket in her attic let  s put on a lunar program sound good but let  s play a game what would be a reasonable reward what company would have a reasonable shot at pull off such a feat just where in the budget would the reward come from should there be a time limit would a straight cash money award be enough or should we throw in say exclusive mining right for the first fifty year you get the idea like to play but i have a clue to the answer
 just a bit off phil we reprocess nuclear fuel because what you get from the reprocess plant be bomb grade plutonium it be also cheaper give current price of thing to simply fabricate new fuel rod rather than reprocess the old one create potentially dangerous material from a national security point of view and then fabricate that back into fuel rod fabricate with reprocess plutonium may result in something that may go kind of boom but it hardly decent bomb grade plutonium if you want bomb grade plutonium use a research reactor not a power reactor but if you want a bomb use plutonium use uranium
 i note that you make no such case a you claim can be  even more easily make yes the argument can and have be make that current government policy creates even large market barrier than there be in the first place but there be no such term a  government failure since the government can change policy whenever it plea the market do that and be govern by relatively well understood force this libertopican bilge about  moral argument about taxation etc  be at bottom so much simplistic economic think it can only be  justified by cliche derision of anyone who know more about economics than the libertopian    which be what invariably happens tripe a la tommy the new libertopian dish wherever do you get this inflate idea of your own importance       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden
 phil one of the early jet fighter have these i also think phil the german do some work on these in wwii the naca come up with them before world war ii nasa be directly descend from the naca with space add in notice that i mention sweep wing even though the x 5 test at what  s now dryden have them we do steal that one dirctly from the german the difference be that swept wing change their angle of sweep sweep wing do perhaps the similarity of name have cause some confusion 747s have swept wing f 111s have sweep wing phil a lot of this be also do by the military     after nasa aerodynamicists propose them and nasa test team demonstrate them richard whitcomb and r t  jones at langley research center be giant in the field dryden be involve in the flight test of winglets and area ruling in the 70 and 50 respectively true that we use military aircraft a the testbeds kc 135 and yf 102 but that have more to do with availability and need than with military involvement the yf 102 be completely ours and the kc 135 be bail to u the air force of course be interested in our result and supportive of our effort dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70 no mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we be general dynamic decide to make the f 16 flyby wire when they saw how successful we be mind you the avro arrow and the x 15 be both fly by wire aircraft much earlier but analog phil egad disagree with mary shafer the nasa habit of acquire second hand military aircraft and use them for testbeds can make thing kind of confuse on the other hand all those second hand navy plane give our test pilot a chance to fold the wing    something most pilot at edward air force base do

 a i heard the story before albert come up the the theory o relativity and warp space nobody could account for mercury  s orbit it ran a little fast i think for simple newtonian physic with the success in find neptune to explain the odd movments of uranus it be postulate that there might be another inner planet to explain mercury  s orbit unlikely anything big than an asteroid be closer to the sun than mercury sure we would have spot it by now perhaps some professional can confirm that
 a related question which i give that much serious thought to at what lattitude be the average length of the day average over the whole year maximize be this function a constant  12 hour be it truly symmetric about the equator or be there some discrepancy due to the fact that the orbit be elliptic or maybe the difference be enough to change the temperature and make the season in the southern hemisphere more bitter but be far too small to make a sizeable difference in daylight hour i want to know where to move

 hi all i really thought that by now i would have see something about this but i so here go last night on the even news the anchorperson say something to the effect that one of the ssrbs that be recover after the recent space shuttle launch be found to have a wrench of some sort rattle around apparently inside the case there be no elaboration a to where specfically the item be found of what type of wrench it be but the anchorperson do say something about a nasa official comment that there would be an inquiry into how the thing get in the ssrb have anybody else on the net whose info source may be well than mine heard anything about this it seem rather weird
 why would you want to do that the goal be to do it cheaper remember this government instead of lease an expensive launch pad just use a ssto and launch from a much cheaper facility allen
 it be more than a theoretical concept it be seriously pursue by freeman dyson et al many year ago i know how well known this be but a high explosive orion prototype flew in the atmosphere in san diego back in 1957 or 1958  i be work at general atomic at the time but i learn about the experiment until almost thirty year later when ted taylor visit u and reveal that it have be do i feel sure that someone must have film of that experiment and really like to see it have anyone out there see it

 there be an interest article in scientific american some time ago about breathing liquid it be a few month before _the abyss_ come out a far a i can remember they mention three thing that be difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid low viscosity    if too difficult to force the fluid in out of the lung you extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort let alone anything else diffusion rate    obviously not all the air in your lung be expel when you breathe out and the part that expel be the part near the wall of the alveolus alveolus so the trip from the blood vessel to the new air have to be do by diffusion of the gas through the fluid apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than co2 so even if you can get enough oxygen in you might not be able to get enough co2 out oxygen co2 capacity    you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume oh and of course your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lung or interfere with their heal or anything like that

 the difficulty of a high isp otv include long transfer time radiation damage from vanallen belt for both the spacecraft and otv arcjets or xenon thruster require huge amount of power so you have to have either nuclear power source messy dangerous and source of radiation damage or big solar array sensitive to radiation or heavy that make attitude control and dock a big pain if you go solar you have to replace the array every trip with current technology nuclear power source be strongly restrict by international treaty refuel even for very high isp like xenon be still require and turn out to be a pain you either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do dock or and refuel you still do much plane change because the deltav require be so high the air force continue to look at do thing this way though i suppose they be biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problem get solve not impossible in principle but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rocket at least today just a few random thought on high isp otv  s i design one once
 hum do you enjoy put word in my mouth come to nome and meet some of these miners   i be not sure how thing go down south in the low 48 i use to visit but of course to believe the media news it go to heck or just plain crazy well it seem that alot of unionist type seem to think that have a job be a right and not a priviledge right to the same job a your forbearers see kennedy  s and tel me what you see and the family they have married into there be a reason why many historian and poli sci type use unionist and socialist in the same breath the miner that i know be just your average hardworking people who pay there tax and earn a living   but tax be not the answer but maybe we could move this discussion to some more appropriate newsgroup

question that you would like include in this post send email to leech cs unc edu jon leech if you want to see the faq add  frequently ask question to your kill file for this group if not reading this with a newsreader that can kill article by subject out of luck the faq volume be excessive right now and will hopefully be trim down by rewrite and condense over time the faq posting be available in the ames space archive in faq faq good summary will be accepted in place of the answer give here the point of this be to circulate exist information and avoid rehash old answer well to build on top than start again nothing more depress than rehash old topic for the 100th time reference be provide because they give more complete information than any short generalization question fall into three basic type 1 where do i find some information about space try your local public library first the net be not a good place to ask for general information ask individual by email if you must there be

 it still applies except the astronomy these day be very long baseline radio astronomy couple to gps and satellite laser range the data from nasa  s and the naval observatory  s among others be a vital source of data for study into crustal dynamic earth rotation and purturbations every time there be a leap second add to the new year remember the military and science be still co habiting nicely the same vlbi be use to track gallileo a it pass the earth and use so little fuel that it can afford to observe ida

 well idea for use of nasa shuttle astronaut and crew be have them be found lose in space after a accident with a worm hole or other space time glitch   maybe age jemison a few year makeup and such and have her a the only survivour of a fail shuttle mission that get lost   heh of late they way they have be have shuttle problem in the medium anything can happen   imagine a astronaut crew member to find themselves in the 24th century a the object of interest of an alien civilization maybe rescue or help by the st enterprise     i know vegr and such be okay but this could be better
 i thought that under emergency condition the sts can put down at any good size airport if it could take a c 5 or a 747 then it can take an orbiter you just need a vor tac i know if they need il pat
 i know people hate it when someone say somethings like    there be an article about that somewhere a while ago    but go to say it anyway i read an article on this subject almost certainly in space news and something like six month ago if anyone be really interested in the subject i can probably hunt it down give enough motivation
 in fact you probably want to avoid u government anything for such a project the pricetag be invariably too high either in money or in hassle the important thing to realize here be that the big cost of get to the moon be get into low earth orbit everything else be practically down in the noise the only part of get to the moon that pose any new problem beyond what you face in low orbit be the last 10km    the actual land    and that be not immensely difficult of course you  can  spend sagadollars saga  be the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns on thing other than the launch but you have to the major component of any realistic plan to go to the moon cheaply for more than a brief visit at least be low cost transport to earth orbit for what it cost to launch one shuttle or two titan iv you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper delta clipper might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there be less ambitious way of bring cost down quite a bit any plan for do sustain lunar exploration use exist launch system be waste money in a big way give this question like whose launch facility you use be  not  a minor detail they be very important to the cost of the launch which dominates the cost of the project
 seem that the mile long billboard and any other inflateble space object station or what ever have the same problem other than be a little bit different than the    normal    space idea such a truss and shuttle but also dag and such   why not combine the discussion of how and fesibility to the same topic i personnelly liek the idea of a billboard in space but problem how do you service it fly a shuttle dc 1 to near it and then dismount and    fly    to it or what or havign a special dock section for shuttle dc 1 dock also what if the billboard spring a leak self seal and such just think okay ramble    also why must the now inflate billboard not be cover in the inside by a harder substance such a a polymer or other agent and then the now    hard    billboard would be a now giant dock structure space dock station
 in my last post i refer to michael adam a    nick    completely my error nick adam be a film and tv actor from the  50  s and early  60 s remember johnny yuma the rebel he be from my part of the country and michael  s email address of    nmsca        probably help confuse thing in my mind purely user headspace error on my part sorry
 hmmmm     the prefix    peri     be greek not latin so usually use with the greek form of the name of the body be orbit why    perihelion    rather than    perisol       perigee    rather than    periterr    and    pericynthion    rather than    perilune    so for jupiter expect it to be something like    perizeon
 archive name space probe last modified date 93 04 01 14 39 19 planetary probe historical mission this section be lightly adapt from an original post by larry klaes klaes verga enet dec com mostly minor format change matthew wiener weemba libra wistar upenn edu contribute the section on voyager and the section on sakigake be obtain from isas material post by yoshiro yamada yamada yscvax ysc go jp u planetary mission mariner venus mar mercury flybys and orbiter mariner 1 the first u s  attempt to send a spacecraft to venus fail minute after launch in 1962  the guidance instruction from the ground stop reach the rocket due to a problem with it antenna so the onboard computer take control however there turn out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly go off course so the range safety officer destroyed it although the bug be sometimes claimed to have be an incorrect fortran do statement it be actually a transcription error in which the bar indicate smooth be omit from the expression    r dot bar sub n    nth smooth value of derivative of radius this error lead the software to treat normal minor variation of velocity a if they be serious lead to incorrect compensation mariner 2 become the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of 1962 and it return information which confirm that venus be a very hot 800 degree fahrenheit now revise to 900 degree f  world with a cloud covered atmosphere compose primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid be later confirm in 1978 mariner 3 launch on november 5 1964 be lose when it protective shroud fail to eject a the craft be place into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun  s energy for power from it solar panel the probe soon die when it battery ran out and be now in solar orbit it be intend for a mar flyby with mariner 4  mariner 4 the sister probe to mariner 3 do reach mar in 1965 and take the first close up image of the martian surface 22 in all a it flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientist conclude from this preliminary scan that mar be a    dead    world in both the geological and biological sense mariner 5 be sent to venus in 1967  it reconfirm the data on that planet collect five year earlier by mariner 2 plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at it surface be at least 90 time that of earth  s or the equivalent of be 3 300 foot under the surface of an ocean mariner 6 and 7 be sent to mar in 1969 and expand upon the work do by mariner 4 four year earlier however they fail to take away the concept of mar a a    dead    planet first make from the basic measurement of mariner 4  mariner 8 end up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot fail mariner 9 the sister probe to mariner 8 become the first craft to orbit mar in 1971  it return information on the red planet that no other probe have do before reveal huge volcano on the martian surface a well a giant canyon system and evidence that water once flow across the planet the probe also take the first detailed closeup image of mar two small moon phobos and deimos mariner 10 use venus a a gravity assist to mercury in 1974  the probe do return the first close up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet reveal previously unseen detail in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in four earth day mariner 10 eventually make three flybys of mercury from 1974 to 1975 before run out of attitude control gas the probe reveal mercury a a heavily cratered world with a mass much great than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury have an iron core which make up 75 percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiter pioneer 1 through 3 fail to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they do reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon include new data on the van allen radiation belt circle earth all three craft have failure with their rocket launcher pioneer 1 be launch on october 11 1958 pioneer 2 on november 8 and pioneer 3 on december 6  pioneer 4 be a moon probe which miss the moon and become the first u s  spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959  pioneer 5 be originally design to flyby venus but the mission be scale down and it instead study the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to 36 2 million kilometer in 1960 a record until mariner 2  pioneer 6 through 9 be place into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 pioneer 6 7 and 8 be still transmit information at this time pioneer e would have be number 10 suffer a launch failure in 1969  pioneer 10 become the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973  pioneer 11 follow it in 1974 and then go on to become the first probe to study saturn in 1979  both vehicle should continue to function through 1995 and be head off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venus 1 1978 also know a pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer 12 burn up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8 1992  pvo make the first radar study of the planet  s surface via probe pioneer venus 2 also know a pioneer 13 sent four small probe into the atmosphere in december of 1978  the main spacecraft bus burn up high in the atmosphere while the four probe descend by parachute towards the surface though none be expect to survive to the surface the day probe do make it and transmit for 67 5 minute on the ground before it battery fail ranger lunar lander and impact mission ranger 1 and 2 be test probe for the ranger lunar impact series they be meant for high earth orbit test in 1961 but rocket problem left them in useless low orbit which quickly decayed ranger 3 launch on january 26 1962 be intend to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problem during the launch cause the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger 3 do try to take some image of the moon a it flew by but the camera be unfortunately aim at deep space during the attempt ranger 4 launch april 23 1962 have the same purpose a ranger 3 but suffer technical problem enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first u s  probe to reach the moon albeit without return data ranger 5 launch october 18 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4 lose all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually miss the moon and drift off into solar orbit ranger 6 through 9 have more modify lunar mission they be to send back live image of the lunar surface a they head towards an impact with the moon ranger 6 fail this objective in 1964 when it camera do not operate ranger 7 through 9 perform well become the first u s  lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through 1965  lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter 1 through 5 be design to orbit the moon and image various site be study a land area for the man apollo mission of 1969 1972  the probe also contribute greatly to our understand of lunar surface feature particularly the lunar farside all five probe of the series launch from 1966 to 1967 be essentially successful in their mission they be the first u s  probe to orbit the moon all los be eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the man apollo mission surveyor lunar soft lander the surveyor series be design primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it be fear by some that the moon be cover in great layer of dust which would not support a heavy land vehicle surveyor be successful in prove that the lunar surface be strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968  only surveyor 2 and 4 be unsuccessful mission the rest become the first u s  probe to soft land on the moon take thousand of image and scoop the soil for analysis apollo 12 land 600 foot from surveyor 3 in 1969 and return part of the craft to earth surveyor 7 the last of the series be a purely scientific mission which explore the tycho crater region in 1968  viking mar orbiter and lander viking 1 be launch from cape canaveral florida on august 20 1975 on a titan 3e centaur d1 rocket the probe go into martian orbit on june 19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slope of chryse planitia on july 20 1976  it soon begin it programmed search for martian micro organism there be still debate a to whether the probe found life there or not and sent back incredible color panorama of it surroundings one thing scientist learn be that mar sky be pinkish in color not dark blue a they originally thought the sky be pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust particle in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulder stretch out a far a it camera could image the viking 1 orbiter kept function until august 7 1980 when it ran out of attitude control propellant the lander be switch into a weather reporting mode where it have be hop it would keep function through 1994 but after november 13 1982 an errant command have be sent to the lander accidentally tell it to shut down until far order communication be never regain again despite the engineer effort through may of 1983  an interest side note viking 1  s lander have be designate the thomas a  mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander image team the national air and space museum in washington d c  be entrust with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attach to the lander by a man expedition viking 2 be launch on september 9 1975 and arrive in martian orbit on august 7 1976  the lander touch down on september 3 1976 in utopia planitia it accomplish essentially the same task a it sister lander with the exception that it seisometer work record one marsquake the orbiter have a series of attitude control gas leak in 1978 which prompt it be shut down that july the lander be shut down on april 12 1980  the orbit of both viking orbiter should decay around 2025  voyager outer planet flybys voyager 1 be launch september 5 1977 and flew past jupiter on march 5 1979 and by saturn on november 13 1980  voyager 2 be launch august 20 1977 before voyager 1 and flew by jupiter on august 7 1979 by saturn on august 26 1981 by uranus on january 24 1986 and by neptune on august 8 1989  voyager 2 take advantage of a rare once every 189 years alignment to slingshot it way from outer planet to outer planet voyager 1 could in principle have head towards pluto but jpl opt for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probe our knowledge of the 4 giant planet their satellite and their ring have become immense voyager 1 2 discover that jupiter have complicate atmospheric dynamic lightning and aurora three new satellite be discover two of the major surprise be that jupiter have ring and that io have active sulfurous volcano with major effect on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probe reach saturn they discover over 1000 ringlet and 7 satellite include the predict shepherd satellite that keep the ring stable the weather be tame compare with jupiter massive jet stream with minimal variance a 33 year great white spot band cycle be know titan  s atmosphere be smoggy mimas appearance be startle one massive impact crater give it the death star appearance the big surprise here be the stranger aspect of the ring braid kink and spoke be both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager 2 thanks to heroic engineering and program effort continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself be highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity be that it magnetic axis be found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis give uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channel be found on ariel and miranda be a bizarre patchwork of different terrain 10 satellite and one more ring be discover in contrast to uranus neptune be found to have rather active weather include numerous cloud feature the ring arc turn out to be bright patch on one ring two other ring and 6 other satellite be discover neptune  s magnetic axis be also skewed triton have a canteloupe appearance and geyser what  s liquid at 38k the two voyager be expect to last for about two more decade their on target journeying give negative evidence about possible planet beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause soviet planetary mission since there have be so many soviet probe to the moon venus and mar i will highlight only the primary mission soviet lunar probe luna 1 lunar impact attempt in 1959 miss moon and become first craft in solar orbit luna 2 first craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959  luna 3 take first image of lunar farside in 1959  zond 3 take first image of lunar farside in 1965 since luna 3  be also a test for future mar mission luna 9 first probe to soft land on the moon in 1966 return image from surface luna 10 first probe to orbit the moon in 1966  luna 13 second successful soviet lunar soft land mission in 1966  zond 5 first successful circumlunar craft zond 6 through 8 accomplish similar mission through 1970  the probe be unmanned test of a man orbit soyuz type lunar vehicle luna 16 first probe to land on moon and return sample of lunar soil to earth in 1970  luna 20 accomplish similar mission in 1972  luna 17 deliver the first unmanned lunar rover to the moon s surface lunokhod 1 in 1970  a similar feat be accomplish with luna 21 lunokhod 2 in 1973  luna 24 last soviet lunar mission to date return soil sample in 1976  soviet venus probe venera 1 first acknowledge attempt at venus mission transmission lose enroute in 1961  venera 2 attempt to image venus during flyby mission in tandem with venera 3  probe cease transmit just before encounter in february of 1966  no image be return venera 3 attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface transmission cease just before encounter and entire probe become the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966  venera 4 first probe to successfully return data while descend through venusian atmosphere crush by air pressure before reach surface in 1967  venera 5 and 6 mission profile similar in 1969  venera 7 first probe to return data from the surface of another planet in 1970  venera 8 accomplish a more detailed mission in 1972  venera 9 sent first image of venusian surface in 1975  be also the first probe to orbit venus venera 10 accomplish similar mission venera 13 return first color image of venusian surface in 1982  venera 14 accomplish similar mission venera 15 accomplish radar mapping with venera 16 of section of planet  s surface in 1983 more detailed than pvo vega 1 accomplish with vega 2 first balloon probe of venusian atmosphere in 1985 include two lander flyby bus go on to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close up in march of 1986  soviet mar probe mar 1 first acknowledge mar probe in 1962  transmission cease enroute the follow year zond 2 first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian surface probe signal cease enroute in 1965  mar 2 first soviet mar probe to land albeit crash on martian surface orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red planet in 1971  mar 3 first successful soft land on martian surface but lander signal cease after 90 second in 1971  mar 4 attempt at orbit mar in 1974 brake rocket fail to fire probe go on into solar orbit mar 5 first fully successful soviet mar mission orbit mar in 1974  return image of martian surface comparable to u s  probe mariner 9  mar 6 land attempt in 1974  lander crashed into the surface mar 7 lander miss mar completely in 1974 go into a solar orbit with it flyby bus phobos 1 first attempt to land probe on surface of mar large moon phobos probe fail enroute in 1988 due to human computer error phobos 2 attempt to land probe on martian moon phobos the probe do enter mar orbit in early 1989 but signal cease one week before schedule phobos land while there have be talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probe within the next thirty year no major step have yet be take with these project more intensive study of the moon mar venus and various comet have be plan for the 1990s and a mercury mission to orbit and land probe on the tiny world have be plan for 2003  how the many change in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent state will affect the future of their space program remains to be see japanese planetary mission sakigake ms t5 be launch from the kagoshima space center by isas on january 8 1985 and approach halley  s comet within about 7 million km on march 11 1986  the spacecraft be carry three instru  ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind all of which work normally now so isas make an earth swingby by sakigake on january 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth  s the closest approach be at 23h08m47s jst utc 9h on january 8 1992  the geocentric distance be 88 997 km this be the first planet swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observe the geotail some geotail passage will be schedule in some year hence the second earth swingby will be on june 14 1993 at 40 re earth  s radius and the third october 28 1994 at 86 re hiten a small lunar probe be launch into earth orbit on january 24 1990  the spacecraft be then know a muses a but be rename to hiten once in orbit the 430 lb probe loop out from earth and make it first lunary flyby on march 19 where it drop off it 26 lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point become the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon join the unites state and ussr the small spacecraft hagoromo remain in orbit around the moon an apparently broken transistor radio cause the japanese space scientist to lose track of it hagoromo  s rocket motor fire on schedule on march 19 but the spacecraft  s track transmitter fail immediately the rocket fire of hagoromo be optically confirm use the schmidt camera 105 cm f3 1 at the kiso observatory in japan hiten make multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly interval and perform aerobraking experiment use the earth  s atmosphere hiten make a close approach to the moon at 22 33 jst utc 9h on february 15 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon  s surface 35 3n 9 7e and fire it propulsion system for about ten minute to put the craft into lunar orbit the follow be the orbital calculation result after the approach apoapsis altitude about 49 400 km periapsis altitude about 9 600 km inclination 34 7 deg to ecliptic plane period 4 7 day planetary mission reference i also recommend reading the follow work categorize in three group general overview specific book on particular space mission and periodical source on space probe this list be by no mean complete it be primarily design to give you place to start your research through generally available work on the subject if anyone can add pertinent work to the list it would be greatly appreciate though naturally i recommend all the book list below i think it would be best if you start out with the general overview book in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area i also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general work on astronomy and the sol system to give you some extra background most of these book and periodical can be found in any good public and university library some of the more recently

on every space probe mission it have launch good university library will carry these book and they be easily found simply by know which mission you wish to read about i recommend these work after you first study some of the book list above some periodical i recommend for reading on space probe be national geographic which have write article on the pioneer probe to earth s moon luna and the jovian planet jupiter and saturn the ranger surveyor lunar orbiter and apollo mission to luna the mariner mission to mercury venus and mar the viking probe to mar and the voyager mission to jupiter saturn uranus and neptune more detail on american soviet european and japanese probe mission can be found in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and scientific american magazine time newsweek and various major newspaper can supply not only general information on certain mission but also show you what else be go on with earth at the time event be unfold if that be of interest to you space mission be affected by numerous political economic and climatic factor a you probably know depend on just how far your interest in space probe will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the large space group in the world dedicate to planetary exploration their periodical the planetary report detail the late space probe mission write to the planetary society 65 north catalina avenue pasadena california 91106 usa good luck with your study in this area of space exploration i personally find planetary mission to be one of the more excite area in this field and the benefit human society have and will receive from it be incredible with many yet to be realize larry klaes klaes verga enet dec com

 actually they be legal i not familiar with the ad you be speak of but know popular science it be probably on the fringe however you may be speak of    public missle inc     which be a legitimate company that have be around for a while due to advance in composite fuel engine be now available for model rocket use similar composite to srb fuel roughly 3 time more powerful than black powder motor they be even available in a reloadable form i e aluminum case end casing o rings the engine range from d all the way to m in common manufacture n and o heard of use at special occasion to be a model rocket however the rocket contain any metal structural part amongst other requirement never heard of a model rocket do 50 000  i have heard of 20 000 foot flight these require faa waiver of course there be a few large national launch ldrs fireball at which you can see many k size engine flight actually use a g engine constitutes the area of    high power rocketry    which be seperate from normal model rocketry purchase of engine like i have be describe require membership in the national association of rocketry the tripoli rocketry assoc  or you have to be part of an educational institute or company involve in rocketry amatuer rocketry be another area not really familiar with this but it be an area where metal part be allow along with liquid fuel and what not i know what kind of regulation be involve but sure they be numerous
 exactly some of the space 1999 effect remain first rate even today later on the anderson try to shed their reputation a creator of some of the bad pseudo scientific show in tv history by fly    into infinity    this be a one off thing do a part of bbc  s    educational sf    series    the day after tomorrow    the anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of reach the speed of light    lightship altares    the four man crew eventually journeyed into a black hole and end up on the far side of the galaxy i think i saw this a a 9 year old back in 1976 and like it very much but then again i be a fan of space 1999 so i guess i be easily satisfied in those day    do anyone know if    into infinity    have be release on video i have some space 1999 show on vhs and know that thunderbird etc also be available in england
 yes the phobos mission do return some useful data include image of phobos itself the best see have a surface resolution of about 40 meter by the way the new book entitle    mar    kieffer et al 1992 university of arizona press have a great chapter on spacecraft exploration of the planet the chapter be co authored by v i moroz of the space research institute in moscow and include detail never before publish in the west know of any ftp site with image though
 well they export anywhere near 50 of their gnp mexico  s perhaps but not their own they actually export around the 9 10 mark similar to most developed country actually australia export a large share of gnp a do the united state 14 i think off hand always likely to be out by a factor of 12 or more though this would be immediately obvious if you thought about it it be their import route that count they can do without export but they live without import for any longer than six month if that too true but one that be unstable and hence a source of serious worry joseph askew
 thing could be bad a lot bad in the mid eighties the teen adult sci fi comic 2000ad fleetway produce a short story feature the award win character    judge dredd    the story focus on an advertising agency of the future who use high power multi coloured lasers search light point at the moon to paint image on the moon needle to say this use hack off a load of lover romantic and werewolfs crazies the ad guy get chopped the service discontinue a cautionary tale indeed marvin batty

 i love the idea of an inflatable 1 mile long sign     it will be a really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt or even well a westford needle come crash into it at 10 click a sec boom whooooooooshhhhhh         sputter sputter okay pretend it would make a sound                       just a thought     let  s pretend it be inflate and pressurize there be a large static electricity build up around the puncture if the metalization be behind a clear sandwich ie insulate then the deflate balloon would generate electrical interference    noise    by the way any serious high velocity impact would simply cut a    bug bunny    hole through the wall highly unlikely to    boom    and the fabric would almost certainly be ripstop
 exactly when will the hover test be do and will any of the tv network carry it i really want to see that

 no the idea be suggest around here during discussion of possible near term commercial space activity one of the folk involve in those discussion a spacecraft engineer name preston carter pass the suggestion on to some entreprenurial type and mike lawson be apparently go ahead with it preston be now at llnl and be work with space marketing on the sensor that might be carry actually that sound unlikely i know what the launch vehicle would be but i would expect it to go on a commercial launcher    certainly not on the shuttle    and the fraction of the cost paid to nasa for e g  launch support would probably cover nasa  s incremental cost pretty well no a note llnl be involve in lightweight sensor design per clementine and related program sure folk around here would like to see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure but after all the u s  do the echo satellite long ago and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than echo be or a parade balloon for that matter while i happen to personally dislike the idea mostly because get a background in astronomy hardly vandalism    it would be a short lived intrusion on the night sky do no permanent damage and actually hurt only a small subset of astronomer on the other hand it would certainly draw attention to space which unfortunately this be not likely to contribute much to a far a i know a purely commercial venture i gather it be be very seriously discuss with possible advertiser commercial project however generally get    funding       they get    customer       whether it will have customer remains to be see nahh too busy watch for mutant bacteria to notice anything in the sky jordin kare jtk s1 gov lawrence livermore national laboratory

 report yesterday in the washington post kathy sawyer writer the article play down the russian role in u space gibbon science advisor to clinton sent goldin a letter indicate nasa should not limit redesign option to those compatible with mir orbit the white house think expectation for russian cooperation have be raise too high the article report that some think the spending and schedule limit for space station be so stringent that the redesign be nearly impossible why some think goldin have begin look at russian hardware goldin state nasa will present all option to the administration which will then have decision make power goldin and the white house have totally rule out use energia to boost the station
 this be turn into  what  s a moonbase good for and i ought not to post when a hundred some odd post to go but i would think that the real reason to have a moon base be economic since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much large gnp than they would _without_ space industry eventually they will simply be able to afford more stuff
 that be an idea   the most efficient moon habitat   also the idea of how to get the people off the moon once the prize be won   also the idea of how to rescue someone who be    die    on the moon maybe have a area where they can all    see    each other and can help each other if something happens   i liek the idea of one prize for the first moon land and return by a non governmental body   also the idea of then have a moon habitat race   i know we need to do somthing to get people involved   eccentric millionaire billionaire would be nice   we see how old ross feel about it   after all it would be a great promotional thing and a way to show he do care about commericalization and the people   will try to broach the subject to him   moonbase on the cheap be a good idea   nasa and friend seem to take to much time and give u to expensive stuff that of late do not work hubble and such basically what be the difference between a 1mil peice of junk and a multi 1mil piece of junk   i know junk

 do anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tank for sound rocket well first you work out how much cold gas you need then make the tank big enough our sound rocket payload with telemetry guidance etc etc and a telescope cluster weighs around 1100 pound it us freon jet for steer and a pulse width modulated controller for alignment ie during our eight minute in space the jet be pretty much continuously fire on a  10 duty cycle or so     the jet also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization and flip the payload around to look at the sun we have two freon tank each hold  5 liter of freon speak only from memory of the last flight the ground crew at wsmr choose how much freon to use base on some black magic algorithm they have extra tank module that just bolt into the payload stack this should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity if you really need to know send me email and i  ll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people cheer craig

single set of law or equation but they have be systematically ignore or suppress an excellent one for 30 year the late physicist dewey b  larson  s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he call the    reciprocal system    be built on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1    the physical universe be compose entirely of one component motion exist in three dimension in discrete unit and in two reciprocal form space and time    2    the physical universe conforms to the relation of ordinary commutative mathematics it magnitude be absolute and it geometry be euclidean    from these two postulate larson developed a complete theoretical universe use various combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational  rotational motion the concept of in ward and out ward scalar motion and speed in relation to the speed of light which larson call    unit velocity    and    the natural datum    at each step in the development larson be able to match object in his theoretical universe with object in the real physical universe photon sub atomic particle incomplete atom charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar etc even object not yet discover then such a explode galaxy and gamma ray burst and apply his theory to his new model of the atom larson be able to precisely and accurately calculate inter  atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of this be described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his book book of dewey b  larson the follow be a complete list of the late physicist dewey b  larson  s book about his comprehensive

or public library have each of them several of them include the last one be available from the international society of unified science isus 1680 e  atkin ave  salt lake city utah 84106  this be the organization that be start to promote larson  s theory they have other related publication include the quarterly journal    reciprocity    physicist dewey b  larson  s background physicist dewey b  larson be a retire engineer chemical or electrical he be about 91 year old when he die in may 1989  he have a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to compute chemical property base only on the element use larson  s lack of a fancy    ph d     degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore him but it be not a valid reason sometimes it take a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the tree at the same time it be clear from his book that he also knew orthodox physic and astronomy a well a any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction ad hoc assumption principle of impotence in consistencies etc   larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it be not necessary for him to do so he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researcher experimental and observational data and in many case his explanation fit well a self consistent theory be much more than the orthodox physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for a    unified field theory    that work but have be ignore one for over 30 year now    modern physic    do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of larson  s book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that    epicycle       crystal sphere       geocentricity       flat earth theory    etc  also once seem to explain it well but be later prove conceptually wrong prof  frank h  meyer professor emeritus of uw superior was is a strong proponent of larson  s theory and be or still be president of larson  s organization    the international society of unified science    and editor of their quarterly journal    reciprocity    he move to minneapolis after retire    super collider    boondoggle i be against contruction of the    superconducting super collider    in texas or anywhere else it would be a gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of    scientific    value most physicist realize it but accord to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b  larson a described in his book the strange goofy particle    meson       hyperon    allege    quark    etc which they be find in exist collider fermi lab cern etc be really just atom of anti matter which be create by the high energy collide beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment a large and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti matter that the physicist have not see there before and the physicist will be even more confuse than they be now be a few more type of anti matter atom worth the 8 3 billion cost we have much more important us for this waste money another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in texas have a serious and grow problem with some kind of    fire ant    eat the insulation off underground cable how much poison of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the    supercollider    name the    super collider    after ronald reagon a propose be totally absurd if it be built it should be name after a lead particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson  s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it have more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which larson call    unit velocity    and the    natural datum    in larson  s theory a positron be actually a particle of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in larson  s theory the anti matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury have be observe and precisely measure to advance at the rate of 574 second of arc per century 531 second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet venus earth jupiter etc  the remain 43 second of arc be be use to help    prove    einstein  s    general theory of relativity    but the late physicist dewey b  larson achieve result closer to the 43 second than    general relativity    can by instead use    special relativity    in one or more of his book he apply the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally reject    general relativity    a another mathematical fantasy he also reject most of    special relativity    include the part about    mass increase    near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shifts great than 1 000 really be move faster than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from u in time  in larson  s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure be the clock time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be negligible but at high speed they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be use a a fudge factor larson often use the term    coordinate time    when write about this in regard to    mass increase    it have be proven in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration force mass a f m orthodox physicist be ignore the third factor force in larson  s theory mass stay constant and force drop toward zero force be actually a motion or combination of motion or relation between motion include inward and outward scalar motion the expansion of the universe for example be an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called    big bang    which be yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book    the universe of motion    by dewey b  larson 1984 north pacific publisher p o box 13255 portland oregon 97213 456 page indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portion of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty year ago it contains final solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the formation of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true origin of the    3 degree    background radiation cosmic ray and gamma  ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf explode galaxy etc   it contains what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the follow be an example of his theory  s success in his first book in 1959    the structure of the physical universe    larson predict the existence of explode galaxy several year before astronomer start find them they be a necessary consequence of larson  s comprehensive theory and when quasar be discover he have an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray burst astro physicists and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious gamma ray burst they be originally thought to originate from    neutron star    in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit have be detect them in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any know object except for a few case of directional coincidence gamma ray burst be a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b  larson accord to page 386 of his book    the universe of motion    publish in 1984 the gamma ray burst be come from supernova explosion in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson call the    cosmic sector    because of the relationship between the anti matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with know object and come from all direction uniformly i wonder how close to u in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby gamma ray burst larsonian binary star formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of them but binary star system be actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b  larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which be detailed in chapter 7 of his book    the universe of motion    and in some of his other book first of all accord to larson star do not generate energy by    fusion    a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the complete annihilation of heavy element heavier than iron each element have a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element be the low be this limit a star  s internal temperature increase a it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of iron there be a type i supernova explosion this be because there be so much iron present and that be related to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his book well than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star be blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which be equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long period of time both mass start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blown outward in space now start to form a red giant star the material that have be blown outward in time start to form a white dwarf star both star then start move back toward the    main sequence    from opposite direction on the h r diagram the chance of the two mass fall back into the exact same location in space make a single lone star again be near zero they will instead form a binary system orbit each other accord to larson a white dwarf star have an inverse density gradient be densest at it surface because the material at it center be most widely disperse blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasy about    degenerate matter       neutron star       black hole    etc   larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several    mini    white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by it heat etc  these will become planet in chapter 7 of the universe of motion larson use all this information and other principle of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode  s law    black hole    fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w  hawk recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysis of two    black hole    merge together into a single    black hole    and conclude that the new    black hole    would have more mass than the sum of the two original    black hole    such a result should be recognize by everyone a a red flag cause widespread doubt about the whole idea of    black hole    etc  after reading physicist dewey b  larson  s book about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book    the universe of motion    it be clear to me that    black hole    be nothing more than mathematical fantasy the strange object at cygnus x 1 be just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the    black hole    that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to    prove    their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist stephen hawk the physicist and astronomer seem to be act a if hawk  s severe physical problem somehow make him    wiser    it do not i wish the same attention have be give to physicist dewey b  larson while he be still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to larson  s theory book and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many year ago in connection with ufo  s and unorthodox inventor but i never be able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct i found a possible clue about why they might work on page 112 113 of the book    basic property of matter    by the late physicist dewey b  larson which describes part of larson  s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph    a indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it be brought out in volume i larson  s book    nothing but motion    that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorbed by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited it follow that there be always a large excess of free electron in the material sector material half of the universe most of which be uncharged in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate be thus expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there be other process to be discuss later whereby electron be return to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such a the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level    note that in larson  s theory uncharged electron be also massless and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency above the    unit    frequency spin around one axis at a particular rate below the    unit    rate    unit velocity    be the speed of light and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light accord to larson  s theory i might have the    above    and    below    label mixed up larson be say that outer space be fill with mass  less un charged electron fly around at the speed of light if this be true then the electro magnetic propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhaps give them a charge and mass and shoot them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson  s theory an electrical charge be a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the    unit    frequency superimpose on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confuse meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud suppression of larsonian physic the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b  larson have be available for more than 30 year publish in 1959 in his first book    the structure of the physical universe    it be totally un scientific for hawk wheeler sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call    science    or    physic    or    astronomy    etc a well a the    scientific    literature and the    education    system to totally ignore larson  s theory have they have larson  s theory have excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer such a gamma ray burst and the nature of quasar larson  s theory deserves to be honestly and openly discuss in the physic chemistry and astronomy journal in the u s  and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of larson  s theory should be include in all related course at uw ec uw madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that student be not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they be be fed for more information answer to your question etc  please consult my cite source especially

 every aircraft have flight constraint for speed aoa power when graph these define the  flight envelope of that aircraft presumably so name because the graph line encloses envelope the area on the graph that represent condition where the aircraft fall out of the sky hence  pushing the envelope becomes  operating at or beyond the edge of the flight or operational envelope note that the envelope precisely know until someone actually fly the airplane in those region    up to that point all there be be the theoretical prediction hence one of the thing test pilot do for a living be  push the envelope to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one be    in essence  pushing back the edge of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually start to fail to fly note too that this be do be a quite calculate and careful way flight test be generally carefully coreographed and just what be go to be  pushed and how far be precisely plan despite occasional deviation from plan such a the  early first flight of the f 16 during it high speed taxi test sure mary can tell you everything you ever want to know about this process and then some       insist on perfect safety be for people who have the ball to live in the real world       mary shafer nasa ames dryden

 background the orion spacedrive be a theoretical concept it would be a drive use thermonuclear explosion to drive a spacecraft the idea be that detonate device with somewhere from one to ten megaton yield behind a    pusher plate    attach to the main spacecraft the shock wave from the explosion would transfer momentum to the ship now in an atmosphere i can see this the energy of the explosion heat the atmosphere which expands explosively and slam a shock wave into the pusher plate but in a vacuum only two thing i can see be go to hit the plate fission fusion product barium krypton helium neutron evaporate bomb case and electromagnetic radiation gamma mostly some light heat from irradiate fission product would this work i see the em radiation impel very much momentum especially give the mass of the pusher plate and it seem to me go to get more momentum transfer throw the bomb out the back of the ship than you get from detonate them once there i must be miss something would someone enlighten me via email thanks       jim

initial design have 3 tele operated machinelets 1  an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land 2  a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and 3  a moon train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface each machinelet have a small tv camera utilize a ccd tv chip mount on it a personal computer digitizes the image include reduce picture content and do data compression to allow for minimal image to be sent to the operator for control purpose and also return control signal the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model train with tv camera built in be almost off the shelf item and control electronics for start and stop a train be minimal the user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 second depend on the speed of their data link to ltm1 next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspend from a servo motor operate wire frame mount on the ceiling allow for the ssto to be control by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank model will be modify to be ccd tv chip equip bulldozerlets the entire initial ltm1 will allow remote operator worldwide to receive minimal image while actually operating model for land and takeoff travel and do work the entire system be base on commercially available item and part that can be easily obtain except for the interface electronics which be well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software developer by take a graphically orient communication program dmodem and add a tele operations screen and control the necessary user interface can be provide in under 80 man hour plan of action the diaspar virtual reality network have agree to sponsor this project by provide a host computer network and internet access to that network diaspar be provide the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar have in stock the electronic tank that can be modify and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agrees to provide    rail stock    for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communication package and modify it for control of the machines lets an initial    ground break    with miniature shovel will be perform for a live photo session and news conference on april 30 1993  the initial model will be put in place a time lapse record will be start for historical purpose it be not expect that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declare open for additional building operation and experiment a photographer will be present and the photograph take will be convert to  gif image for distribution world wide to major online network and bb  s a press release will be issue call for contribution of idea time talent material and scale model for the simulated lunar colony a contest for new design and technique for work on the moon will then be announce university will be invite to participate the goal be to find instructor who wish to have class participation in various aspect of the lunar colony model field trip to ltm1 can be arrange and at that time the result of the class work will be add to the model contributor will then be able to tele operate any contribute machine lets once they return to their campus a monthly ltm1 newsletter will be issue both electronically online and via conventional mean to the medium any major new tele operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news medium have a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the    action    will be control by people all over the world science fiction writer will be invite to issue    challenge    to engineering and human factor student at university to build and operate the tele operated equipment to perform lunar task use counter weight and pulley system 1 6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenge the long term goal be create world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony ltm1 have the potential of be a long term global edutainment method for space activity and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject area not limited to space edutainment all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who be ready for the leap to the star conclusion edutainment be the blending of education and entertainment anyone who have ever enjoy see miniature will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purpose by create a tele operated model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also a method of try new idea that require real not virtual skill and open a new method for put people  s mind in space moonlighter    illuminate the path of knowledge about space and lunar development    the follow people be already engage in various part of this work david42 rob47 dash hyson jzer0 vril wyatt the dark one tiggertoo the mad hatter sir robin jogden

 i think this be a little inaccurate base on feynman  s account of the software development process  before  the standdown fred be basically correct no sophisticated tool just a lot of effort and painstaking care but they get this one right  before  challenger feynman cite the software people a exemplary compare to the engine people he also note that the software people be start to feel management pressure to cut corner but have to give in to it much yet among other thing the software people work very hard to get thing right for the major pre flight simulation and consider a failure during those simulation to be nearly a bad a an in flight failure a a result the number of major simulation failure could be count on one hand and the number of in flight failure be zero a fred mention elsewhere this applies only to the flight software software that run experiment be typically mostly put together by the experimenter and get nowhere near the same level of tender love care none of the experimenter could afford it
 unfortunately thing have be boding ill be that a legitimate conjugation for a while while the office of exploration have some great idea they never get much money heard good thing about griffin but hard to want him back in a job where he do anything the group examine the freedom based space station redesign proposal be head by michael griffin    nasa  s cheif engineer    in the word of space news i believe this be him
 a good deal of healthy if not deeply thought out idealism delete below if their parent company do business and they will on the face of the earth then they be vulnerable to govt sanction yes they can be stop for the first 100 500 imho year nobody will have to the colonist will be too dependent on earth too pull it off eventually they will history show u that what exactly do you mean here terrorism start an international incident so your dream can come true crack a few egg to make the omelet this sound fairly irresponsible again the tie that bind will be much strong for space colonist than any immigrant that have go before even those intrepid asian explorer that cross the bering land bridge do not have to carry their air on their back    keep the dream alive maybe dream it a little more cogently
 there be no mariner craft from which we be still receive data i believe you be refer to one or more of pioneer 6 through 9 launch from december 1965 through november 1968 which be put into solar orbit to study interplanetary space i recall reading that at least one of them be still function 25 year after launch
 since the dc x be to take off horizontal why not land that way why do the martian land thing   or be i miss something   know to much about dc x and such   overly obvious why not just fall to earth like the russian craft parachute in then        michael adam nsmca acad3 alaska edu    not high just jacked
 let  s see these in a strict sense amateur rocket that term denotes rocket the engine of which be construct by the user the rocket you describe be call hpr or high power rocket to distinguish them from small model rocket they use factory made ammonium perchlorate composite propellant in phenolic plastic engine with graphite nozzle the engine be classify by impulse a    d    engine for example can have no more than 20 newton seconds of impulse an    f    engine can have no more than 40 n each letter corresponds to a double of the maximum impulse so far engine up to size    o    be available pretty much off the shelf engine of size h and above be ship a class b explosive and a such be control engine of size f and below be ship a class c explosive and be not a control class f engine btw be not hpr engine but model rocket engine class g engine go in and out of legal limbo there be an hpr society the tripoli rocket society i believe which hold event at various site throughout the year with all legality faa waiver include take care of the national association of rocketry be more concerned with engine below h though it be involve in hpr a well these society certify user of hpr rocket and company will not sell to uncertified individual bottom line legit i suggest you send for a catalog but forget the dynamite will ya
 the well question should be why not transfer o m of all bird to a separate agency with continous funding to support these kind of ongoing science mission since we have the money to keep them go now how will change them to a seperate agency help anything
 who say there be no mineral right to be give who say the un or the u government major question be if you decide to mine the moon or mar who will stop you the un other than legal tom foolerie   can the truly inforce it if you go to the moon a declare that you be now a soverign nation who will stop you from do it maybe not acknowledge you why a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great beyond of space what right do earth have to say what be legal and what be not   maybe i be a few year ahead on this   it be liek the old catholic church state which be portugal and what be spain and along come the reformation and make it all null and void   what can happen be to find a nation which be acknowledge and offer your service a a space miner and then go mine the asteroids mars moon or what ever   a long a yur sponsor do not get in trouble   basically find a country who want to go into space but for soem reason or another but who will give you a    home       such a saudia arabia or whatever   there be nation in the world who be not part of the un get to them and offer your service and such   i know that sound crazy but be it   also once you have the mean to mine the moon or whatever then just do it the un if do right can be make to be so busy with something else they will not care   if your worried about the u do the same thing   why be limited by the short sight people of earth   after all they have many other thing to worry about that if someone be mining the moon or mar or what ever   basically what i be say be where be that drive of yeasteryears to go a little bit farther out to do jus ta little bit more and to tell the crown to piss off   if my ancestor thought the way many today think id have be born in central europe just north of the black sea   i just read a good book    tower of the god    interesting

 henry i make the assumption that he who get there firstest with the most win ohhh you want to put in fine print which say    thou shall do wonderous r d rather than use off the shelf hardware    sorry see that in my copy most of the pournellesque proposal run along the line of some dollar amount reward for some simple goal you go ahead and do your development i  ll buy off the shelf at high cost or even russian but i also assume that there  d be some    buy u    provo in there and be camped out in the moon while you be launch and assemble little itty bitty payload in leo with your laser or gas gun and work out the bug of assembly integration in leo oh hey could i get a couple of canadarms tune for the lunar environment i wan na do some teleoperated prospect while up there
 unfortunately if you launch this from the u or be a u citizen you will need a launch permit from the office of commercial space transportation and i think it may be difficult to get a permit for an antisatellite weapon     the threshold at which ocst licensing kick in be roughly 100km the rule be actually phrase in more complex way but that be the result
 last i have heard because of budget and such the air farce be the only    space command    left   the rest mission be generally give to the air farce   probably a good reason for me to transfer from the army guard to the air guard   i hate walk with a pack on my back and how do you put on your application for a job a a kitchen worker that you have do a lot of kp kitchen police

 mcdonnell douglas roll out dc x huntington beach calif     on a picture perfect southern california day mcdonnell douglas roll out it dc x rocket ship last saturday the company hope this single stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle be schedule to go to the white sand missile range in new mexico this week flight test will start in mid june although there a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization    which paid 60 million for the dc x    itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundred of million require for a sub orbital dc xa sdio be passing a tin cup among it sister government agency sdio originally fund ssto research a a way to cut the cost for orbital deployment of space based sensor and weapns however recent change in sdi  s political march order and budget cut have make ssto less of a priority today the agency be more interested in use dc x a a step towards a low cost reusable sound rocket sdio have already do 50 briefing to other government agency say col  simon    pete    worden sdio  s deputy for technology but worden decline to say how much the agency would have to pony up for the program    i make colonel by tell my contractor how much money i have available to spend    he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters while sdio have lower it sight on the program  s orbital objective agency official hail the dc x a an example of the    well faster cheaper    approach to hardware development the agency believe this philosophy can produce breakthrough that    leapfrog    ahead of evolutionary technology development worden say the dc x illustrates how a    build a little test a little    approach can produce result on time and within budget he say the program    which go from concept to hardware in around 18 month    show how today  s engineer could move beyond the    miracle of our parent time       the key be management    worden say    sdio have a very light hand on this project we have only one overwork major jess sponable    although the next phase may involve more agency worden say lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be crucial     essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price go up exponentially    sdio  s approach also won praise from two california member of the house science space and technology committee    this be the direction go to have to go    say rep  george brown the committee s democratic chairman    program that stretch aout 10 to 15 year sustainable      nasa learn it yet sdio have    rep  dana rohrbacher brown  s republican colleague go far joking that    a shrimp be a fish design by a nasa design team    rohrbacher doubt that the program ever would have be complete if it be left to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district include mcdonnell douglas also criticize nasa air force work on conventional multi staged rocket a place new casing around old missile technology    let  s not build fancy ammunition with capsule on top let  s build a spaceship    although rohrbacher praise sdio  s sponsorship he say the private sector need to take the lead in develop ssto technology mcdonnell douglas which face very uncertain prospect with it c 17 transport and space station freedom program be more cautious about a large private secotro commitment    on very large venture company put in seed money    say charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas  senior vice president for space system    you need strong government investment    while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc xa they agree on continue an incremental approach to development cite corporate history they liken the process to douglas aircraft  s dc aircraft just a two earlier aircraft pave the way for the dc 3 transport a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc 1 flight test this summer at white sand will    expand the envelope    of performance with successive test increase speed and altitude the first test will reach 600 foot and demonstrate hover verticle take off and land the second series will send the unmanned dc x up to 5 000 foot the third and final series will take the craft up to 20 000 foot maneuver will become more complex on third phase the final test will include a    pitch over    manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom down configuration for a soft four legged land the flight test series will be supervise by charles    pete    conrad who perform similar maneuver on the apollo 12 moon land now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicle aircraft like approach to operation feature include automate check out and access panel for easy maintainance if the program move to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration this engine would have more thrust than the pratt whitney rl10a 5 engine use on the dc x each motor us liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant to generate up to 14 760 pound of thrust base on the engine use in centaur upper stage the a 5 model have a thrust champer design for sea level operation and three to on throttle capability it also be design for repeat firing and rapid turnaround worden say future single stage rocket could employ tri propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the result engine could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at high altitude
 i be do a political science paper on the funding of nasa and pork barrel politics i would be interested in information about funding practice and history of some of the major program apollo sts ssf etc and the funding of ssto to contrast could someone please recommend some source that would be useful thank you
 it make a whole lot of difference actually since they building spare of the station hardware anyway dumb at least this be only one launch to fail
 hello i be look for a program or algorithm that can be use to compute sunrise and sunset time i would appreciate any advice
 all of this talk about a commercial space race i e 1g to the first 1 year moon base be intrigue similar prize have influence aerospace development before the 25k orteig prize help lindbergh sell his spirit of saint louis venture to his financial backer if memory serf the 25k prize would not have be enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic project such a fokker  s nungesser and other multi engine project however lindbergh ultimately kept his total cost below that amount but i strongly suspect that his saint louis backer have the foresight to realize that much more be at stake than 25 000 could it work with the moon who be the far sighted financial backer of today
 be it right that be new stuff for me so it mean that you just can not put a sattellite around around the moon for too long because it orbit will be unstable if so what be the reason be that because the combine gravitacional atraction of the sun moon and earth that do not provide a stable orbit around the moon c o egalon larc nasa gov c o egalon larc nasa gov

 dennis i have work on or write proposal worth ten of million of customer include government include nasa for profit and non profit company all expect a wrap usually call a fee much of the work involve allocate and cost the work of subcontractor the subcontractor where university for profits non profits and even some of the nasa center for the commercialization of space all charge fee a part of the work down the street be one of the nasa commercialization center they charge a fee now sure your a competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack experience in several area your post show that you understand the importance of integration in large project you also show a lack of understand of cost effort a show by your belief that it be reasonable to charge incremental cost for everything this a flame jsut a statement your employer do charge a fee you may not see it but you do well there you be dennis a i say they simply include the fee in their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depend on the customer integration dennis overhead dennis reston have be the only nasa agency work to reduce cost when wp 02 be hemoraging out a billion the center you love so much where do their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston be the only place you would find people actually interested in solve the problem and building a station when you have a bit more experience dennis you will realize that integration overhead it be the single most important part of a successful large scale effort the story you refer to say that some nasa people blame it on congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it be the center you support so much who cover up the overhead and address the problem until the press publish the story be you say the reston manager where wrong to get nasa to address the overrun you approve of what the center do to cover up the overrun you should know dennis that nasa include transport cost for resuply that come from the shuttle budget what they where say be that operational cost could be cut in half plus transport i do hope you can find the time to tell u just why it be wrong of reston to ask that the problem with wp 02 be address allen
 accord to a software engineering professor here what be actually rat level five be an ibm unit which produce part of the software for the shuttle by not mean all of it interest note 90 of the software development group survey be at level 1  the ibm shuttle group be the  only  one at level 5
