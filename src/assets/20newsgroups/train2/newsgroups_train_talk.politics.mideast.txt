 i will again  repeat  my statement 1 i  do not  condone these  indiscriminate  israeli act nor have i  ever  2 if the villager do not know who these    guerilla    be which you state earlier how do you expect the israeli to know it be   very   difficult to    identify    who they be this  is why  the    guerilla    prefer to lose themselves in the general population by dress the same act the same etc  i agree but because lebanon be either unwilling or unable to stop these attack from it territory should israel simply sit quietly and accept it situation israel ask the lebanese government over and over to control this    third party state    within lebanese territory and the attack kept occur at   what point   do israel or any state have the right to do something itself to stop such attack never it be also the responsibility of  any  state to not allow  any  outside party to use it territory for attack on a neighbor state if 1 angola have the power and 2 south africa refuse or stop anti angolan guerilla base on sa soil from attack angola and 3 south africa refuse to have un troop station on it territory between it and angola would angola be justified in enter sa if not be you say that angola have to accept the situation do nothing and absorb the attack i refer above  at all times  to the palestinian attack on israel from lebanese soil not to lebanese attack on israel one hope that a lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol it border but there be no reason to believe it will be any strong what have change be that the plo be largely  driven out  of lebanon not by the lebanese not by syria and that be by far the most important make it easy to control future palestinian attack from lebanese soil that   change   be brought about by israeli action the plo would  never  have be eject by lebanese arab state or un action i fully recognize that the lebanese do not want to be    use    by either side and have be and continue to be but the most fundamental issue be that if a state can not control it border and make real effort to do so it should expect others to do it for them hopefully that    other    will be the un but it be a we see in it cowardice regard bosnia weak
 there certainly be muslim who  do not  believe that their dream of a global islamic community should be achieve through force there be however others and they be often far more visible vocal than the former who  do  accept the establishment of global islam through force i would  not  feel threaten by those only accept or pursue    islamicization    through peaceful mean nor by jew advocate the same approach those advocate force a a mean of expand their side s power be certainly a threat to palestinian israel be do just that maintain it dominance of those  outside  it own    group    if i be told that    i be not one of you    but you then impose your control on me damn right you be a threat if i be a member of a non muslim minority  inside  the islamic world and  actively do not  accept my    minority    status i  would also certainly  see islam  s domination a have be acheived and maintain through the powerful coercive force all majority wield over minority within their rank i be not a zionist but do feel that  both  jewish and palestinian nationalist desire need at this juncture to be accepted in some way for the same reason that some muslim believe it be proper and righteous for islam to be spread by force upon those who do not want that i refer to the    most    you also refer to because they be scar and feel very threaten a well feel that this area  is  to some degree part of their belief religion heritage  identity etc

in his as we both felt that pull off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the gut in the belly of another arab and how all of u ran toward that spot to take a look i reach the spot first and then that arab blood gush forth from his body spit at me i yell  shut up and he dare talk back to me in hebrew so i just laugh straight in his face i be usually laugh when i stare at something convulse right before my eye then i told him  all right wait a moment i left him in order to take a look at another wound arab i ask a soldier if that arab could be save if the bleeding from his artery could be stop with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep tell all this to my mother with detail and she keep laugh straight into my face this infuriate me i get very angry because i felt i be become mad so i stop eat seize the plate with he omelette and some trimming still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stop laugh at first she know what to say     but i must tell you of a still other madness which fall upon u frequently i go with a friend to practice shoot on a field a gull appear right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we notice four deer stand high up on the hill above u my friend at once aim at one of them and shot it we enjoy the sight of it fall down the rock we shot down two deer more and go to take a look when we climbed the rock we saw a young deer badly wound by our bullet but still try to such some milk from it already dead mother we carefully inspect two path cover by blood and chunk of torn flesh of the two deer we have hit we be just delighted by that sight we have hit em so good then we decide to kill the young deer too so a spare it far suffer i approach take out my revolver and shot him in the head several time from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullet sinking in but my fifth bullet make it brain fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splatter lot of blood straight on u this make u feel cure of the spurt of our madness stand there soak with blood we felt we be like beast of prey we explain what have happen to u we be almost in tear while walk down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly     we always go back to place we carry out assignment in this be why we can see them when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you get power you feel godlike of sort        both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment study the act dudu be not willing to work in any security linked occupation danny feel the exact opposite  why i take advantage of the skill i have master so well why i earn 3 000 for each chopped head i would deliver while be a mercenary in south

 in the south lebanon area only israeli and sla and lebanese troop be present syrian troop be deployed north of the awali river between the awali river and the    security zone    only lebanese troop be station that be your opinion and the opinion of the israeli government i agree peace guarantee would be well for all but i be address the problem a it stand now hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be conclude soon and will include security guarantee for both side my proposal be aim at decrease the casualty in the interim period in my opinion if israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be well off than stay the israeli gov t obviously agrees with you and be not willing to do such a move i hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs why i post to tpm a i explain i contend that if israel do withdraw unilaterally i believe no attack would ensue against northern israel i also explain why i believe that to be the case my suggestion be aim at reduce the level of tension and casualty on all side it be unfortunate that israel do not agree with my opinion that be too bad because israel be not occupy the    security zone    free of charge it be pay the price for that once israel withdraws it may have lose a bargaining chip at the negociate table but it would save some soldier life that be my contention if lebanon be willing to agree to that be completely untrue hizbollah be now a minor force in lebanese politics the real heavy weight be syria  s ally the gov t be support by syria the lebanese army be over 30 000 troop and unified like never before hizbollah can have no moral justification in attack israel proper especially after israeli withdrawal that would draw the ire of the lebanese the syrian and the israeli gov ts if israel do withdraw and such an act hizbolllah attack israel would be akin to political and moral suicide basil

 to andi i have to disagree with you about the value of israeli news source if you want to know about event in palestine it make more sense to get the news directly from the source every news source be inherently bias to some extent and for various reason both intentional and otherwise however the more source rely upon the easy it be to see the    truth    and to discern the bias go read or listen to some israeli medium you will learn more news and more opinion about israel and palestine by do so then you can form your own opinion and hopefully they will be more inform even if your view change

 first of all i never say the holocaust i say before the holocaust not ignorant of the holocaust and know more about nazi germany than most people maybe include you what i resent be ignorant statement that call people name when they disagree with your position oppose the atrocity commit by the israeli governement hardly qualifies a anti semitism if you think name call be a valid form of argument in intellectual circle you need to get out more often i think the suffer of some jew during wwii justifies the crime commit by the israeli government any attempt to call civil liberterians like myself anti semetic be not appreciate

 i bet on it arab government generally care much about the palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purpose back home they be happy to leave the palestineans largely under israeli control because that leaf the job of control them to the israeli the israeli like this job any more than king hussein of jordan like it    and he manage to kill them off at the rate of thousand per month when they start an intifada in jordan the government of syria lebanon and egypt all feel similarly however proclaim public support for the palestinean war against israel deflects criticism from deep problem at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal arab tyrant arab  people  probably much more sympathetic palestineans have show a willingness to destabilize and plunder in jordan lebanon and kuwait and be view with suspicion elsewhere you might still be right in sympathy to the war against israel but i suspect that many arab far remove from the immediate border with israel e g in kuwait or morroco care less

 right probably end up give them weapon during wwii the british manage to supply arm to the yugoslav despite german occupation if the european have the will to do anything besides sponsor peace conference they would have no problem put any kind of weapon they want into bosnia i guess i would favor end the embargo if the congress would pas a law forbid export of u military supply to yugoslavia include via third party until then the risk of the u be drawn into a more active role would be too great i do not see the arm embargo a a major factor in the outcome of the war both side be certainly not equal in the eye of the press and about all we have to go on it and i wish quit hurl word like racist around there be many level at which people react to what they see at the most fundamental level you do not have to consciously recognize the racial element you simply tend to empathize more with people who be like yourself a far prefer christian over moslem i be an atheist myself and i think agree that in the u the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of religion nor give it a particularly important place in their world view

former greek parliamentarian of turkish parentage be sentence recently to 18 month of imprisonment with no right to appeal just for say outloud that he be of turkish descent this duly elected ethnic turkish official be also deprive of his political right for a period of three year each one of these barbaric act seem to be none other than a vehicle use by the greek government to cover up their inferiority complex they display vis a vis the people of turkiye the agreement on the exchange of minority us the term  turks which demonstrates what be actually meant by the previous reference to  muslims the fact that the greek government also mention the existence of a few thousand non turkish muslim do not change the essential reality that there life in western thrace a much big turkish minority the  pomaks be also a muslim people whom all the three nation bulgarian turk and greek consider a part of themselves do you know how the muslim turkish minority be organize accord to the agreement poor  poly it also prof that the turkish people be trap in greece and the greek people be free to settle anywhere in the world the greek authority deny even the existence of a turkish

have make plan to supply it with the tank and armored vehicle it have to destroy in accordance with the agreement reach on conventional arm reduction in europe meanwhile greek and greek cypriot official be report to have plan to take ostentatious measure aim at camouflage the transfer of these tank and armored vehicle to southern cyprus a process that will conflict with the spirit of the

 israel happy 45th birthday
 the lengthy article you quote imply this it only state that it be somehow possible not that it be in any way likely this be akin to an article say that it be possible that the usaf have several capture ufo without support the liklihood of such an assertion in other word they be tell a pesky reporter to keep guess israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapon it may or may not have the u maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapon on specific naval craft by refuse to acknowledge the existence of such weapon on specific ship u warship have i believe become unwelcome in new zealand which have declare itself a nuclear free zone the usaf have never officially admit to have any ufo either this be state a a fact without support evidence it would ve be more convincing if your reporter have come up with just one name of someone who be sit in jail lose to the world a he suggests maybe elvis or jfk somebody let  s put it this way if israel have put people away without publicize their arrest or the legal proceeding against them how have their disappearance be explain people have relative friend and colleague you know israel be not know a a place where people be make to vanish would you care to give u a list of people whose whereabouts be unknown people who be presume to be imprison this whole conspiracy story something that come to associate with yigal arens before perhaps from now on we should
 at issue be not a trial behind close door but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy this be appraently attempt in the case of vanunu and fail it have happen before and there be reason to believe it still go on read this from ma ariv february 18 possibly 28 1992 publication ban the state of israel have never officially admit that for many year there have be in it prison israeli citizen who be sentence to long prison term without either the fact of their arrest or the crime of which they be accuse ever be make public by baruch me iri all those involve in this matter politely refuse my request one way or another    look the subject be too delicate if i comment on it i will be implicitly admit that it be true if i mention a specific case even hint at it i might be guilty of make public something which may legally not be publish    the state of israel have never officially admit that for many year there have be in it prison israeli citizen who be sentence to long prison term without either the fact of their arrest or the crime of which they be accuse ever be make public more precisely a court order publication ban be place on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment in israel of 1993 citizen be imprison without u the citizen of this country know anything about it not know anything about the fact that one person or another be try and thrown in prison for security offense in complete secrecy in the distant past    for example during the day of the lavon ya affair    we heard about    the third man    be in prison but many year have pass since then and what exist then can today no longer be found even in south american country or in the former communist country but it appear that this be still possible in israel of 1993  the chair of the knesset committee on law the constitution and justice mk david zucker sent a letter on this subject early this week to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor ma ariv have obtain the content of the letter    during the past several year a number of israeli citizen have be imprison for various period for security offense in some of these case a legal publication ban be impose not only on the specific of the crime for which the prisoner be convict but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment in those case after be legally convict the prisoner spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner    asserts mk zucker on the other hand zucker agrees in his letter that    there be absolutely no question that it be possible and in some case it be imperative that a publication ban be impose on the specific of security offense and the course of trial but even in such case the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstance under which a trial will not be held in public    however one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person  s arrest and on the name of a person sentence to prison be justified and appropriate in the state of israel the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know be not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison    zucker thus decide to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question    the state of israel be strong enough to withstand the cost incur by abide by the principle of public punishment the state of israel can not be allow to have prisoner whose detention and it cause be kept secret    write zucker the legal counsel of the civil right union attorney mordechai shiffman say that    we a the civil right union do not know of any case of security prisoner citizen of israel who be imprison and whose imprisonment can not be make public this be a situation which if it actually exists be definitely unhealthy just like censorship be an unhealthy matter       the union be aware    say shiffman    of case where notification of a suspect  s arrest to family member and lawyer be withheld i be speak only of several day i know also of case where a detainee be not allow to meet with an attorney    sometimes for the whole first month of arrest that be do because of the great secrecy    the suspect himself his family his lawyer    or even a journalist    can challenge the publication ban in court but there be case where the family member themselves be not interested in publicity the journalist know nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone be happy        attorney yossi arnon an official of the bar claim that give the law a they exist in israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offense be kept secret be definitely possible    nothing be easy the court order a publication ban and that someone who have commit security offense can spend long year in prison without u know anything about it       do you find this situation acceptable attorney arnon    definitely not we live in a democratic country and such a state of affair be impermissible i be well aware that publication can be damage    from the standpoint of security    but total non publication silence be unacceptable consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in his case we know that he be charge with aggravate espionage and sentence to 18 year in prison the trial be held behind close door nobody knew the detail except for those who be authorize to it be somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reason but a i have note we at least be aware of his imprisonment       why be the matter actually that serious we trust the discretion of the court attorney arnon    the judge have no choice but to trust the presentation make to them the judge do not have the tool to investigate this give the government enormous power power which they can misuse       and what if there really be a security issue attorney arnon    i be a man of the legal system not a security expert democracy stand in opposition to security i believe it be possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charge    without enter into detail we have already see how the law concern publication ban can be misuse in the case of the rachel heller murder a suspect in the murder be held for many month without the matter be make public    attorney shiffman on the other hand believe that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibit publication of a suspect s arrest or of a convict criminal  s imprisonment    a healthy situation definitely not but i be aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security    a different opinion be express by attorney uri shtendal former advisor for arab affair to prime minister levi eshkol and golda meir    clearly we be speak of isolated special case such situation contrast with the principle that a judicial proceed must be held in public no doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which be also harm by the prohibition of publication    nevertheless    add shtendal    the legislator allow for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special case where the damage possible a a consequence of publication be great than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principle mention the authority to decide such matter of publication do not rest with the prime minister or the security service but with the court which we may rest assure will authorize a publication ban only if it have be convince of it need beyond a shadow of a doubt    nevertheless attorney shtendal agrees    a a rule clearly such a phenomenon be undesirable such an extreme step must be take only in the most extreme circumstance

there be many of them the door fell down at an angle the mob try to remove the door so a to go into the second room and to continue to finish u off father brought skewer and give them to sasha and me    we flew at them when we saw father bleeding his face be cover with blood he have be wound in the head and his whole face be bloody we just threw ourselves on them when we saw that we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the one in the hall drove them down to the third floor we come out on the land but a group of the bandit remain in one of the room they be smash all the furniture in there have close the door behind them we start tear the door off to chase away the remain one or finish them then a man an impose man of about 40 an azerbaijani come in when he be come in father fell down and mother flew to him and start to cry out i jumped out onto the balcony and start call an ambulance but then the mob start throw stone through the window of our veranda and kitchen we live on the fourth floor and no one come i go into the room it seem to me that this man be the leader of the group he be respectably dress in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar and he address my mother in azerbaijani    what  s with you woman why be you shout what happen why be you shout like that    she say    what do you mean what happen you kill somebody    my father be a musician he played the

joy to people and you kill that person    he say    you need to shout stop shout    and when they heard the voice of this man the 15 to 18 people who be in the other room open the door and start run out we chase after them but they ran away that man left too a we be later told downstairs one of them told the others i know if it be from fright or what told them that we have firearm even though we only fought with hammer and an axe we race to father and start to massage his heart but it be already too late we ask the neighbor to call an ambulance the ambulance never come although we wait for it all even and all through the night somewhere around midnight about 15 policeman come they inform u they be from khachmas they say    we heard that a group be here at your place you have our condolence    they told u not to touch anything and left father lay in the room so we stayed home each of u take a hammer and a knife we sat at home well we say if they descend on u again defend ourselves somewhere around one o clock in the morning two people come from the sumgait procuracy investigator they say    leave everything just how it be come back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything    then people come from the republic procuracy too but no one help u take father away the morning come and the neighbor arrive we want to take father away somehow we call the procuracy and the police a couple of time but no one come we call an ambulance and nobody come then one of the neighbor say that the bandit be come to our place again and we should hide we secure the door somehow or other we left father in the room and go up to the neighbor  s the excess begin again in the morning the bandit come in several vehicle zil panel truck and threw themselves out of the vehicle like a land force near the center of town our building be locate right there a crowd form then they start fight with the soldier then in building 19 and 20 next to the airline ticket office they start break into armenian apartment destroy property and steal the armenian at home they have manage to flee and hide somewhere and again they pour in the direction of our building they be shout that there be some armenian left on the fourth floor meaning us     up there still up there let  s go kill them    they broke up all the furniture remain in the two room threw it outside and burn it in large fire we be hiding one floor up something heavy fell sasha threw himself toward the door shout that it be probably father they have thrown father be defile the corpse probably throw it in the fire go to burn it i heard it and the sound be kind of hollow and i say    no from some of the furniture    mother and i pounce on sasha and stop him somehow and calm him down the mob left somewhere around eight o clock they smash open the door and go into the apartment of the neighbor across from u they be also armenian they have left for another city the father of the neighbor who be conceal u come and say    be you crazy why be you hiding armenian you now check all the apartment they could kill you and them    and to u    come on leave this apartment    we go down to the third floor to some other neighbor at first the man want to let u in but then one of his son ask him and he relent we stayed there until eleven o clock at night we heard the sound of motor the neighbor say that it be armored personnel carrier we go downstairs there be a light on in the room where we left father in the other room a we found out later all the chandelier have be torn down they left only one bulb the bulb be burning which probably be a signal they have agree on because there be a light burning in every apartment in our microdistrict 3 where there have be a pogrom with the help of the soldier we make it to the city party committee and be save our salvation    my mother  s my brother  s and mine    be purely accidental because a we later found out from the neighbor someone in the crowd shout that we have firearm up there well we fought but we be only able to save mother we save father we inflict many injury on the bandit some of them serious but others come to take their place we be also wound there be blood and we be scratch all over    we get our share it be a miracle we survive we be save by a miracle and the troop and if troop come to sumgait the slaughter would have be even great probably all the armenian would have be victim of the genocide through an acquaintance at the city party committee i be able to contact the leadership of the military unit that be brought into the city and at their order we be assign special people to accompany u expert we go to pick up father  s corpse we take it to the morgue this be about two o clock in the morning it be already march 1 it be rain very hard and it be quite cold and we be wear only our suit when my brother and i carry father into the morgue we saw the burn and disfigure corps there be about six burn people in there and the small corpse of a burn child it be gruesome i suffer a tremendous shock there be about ten people there but the doctor on duty say that because of the number they be be take to baku there be a woman  s corpse there too she have be well there be part of a body there a hacked off part of a woman  s body it be something terrible the morgue be guard by the land force the child that have be kill be only ten or twelve year old it be impossible to tell if it be a boy or a girl because the corpse be burn there be a man there too several men you tell anything because their face be disfigure they be in such awful condition     now two and a half month have pass every day i recall with horror what happen in the city of sumgait every day my father and the death of my father and how we fought and the people  s sorrow and especially the morgue i still want to say that 70 year have pass since soviet power be establish and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happen in sumgait it will go down in history particularly surprised that the mob even afraid of the troop they even fought the soldier many soldier be wound the mob threw fuel mixture onto the armored personnel carrier set them on fire they afraid they be so sure of their impunity that they attack our troop i saw the clash on february 29 near the airline ticket office right across from our building and that mob be fight with the soldier the inhabitant of some of the building also azerbaijani threw rock at the soldier from window balcony even cinder block and glass tank they afraid of them i say they be sure of their impunity when we be at the neighbor and when they be rob home near the airline ticket office i call the police at number 3 20 02 and say that they be rob armenian apartment and burning home and they told me that they knew that they be be burn during those day no one from the police department come to anyone  s aid no one come to help u either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and save u a we later found out the mob be give free vodka and drug near the bus station rock be distribute in all part of town to be thrown and use in fight so i think all of it be arrange in advance they even knew in which building and apartment the armenian live on which floor    they have list the bandit you can tell that the    operation    be plan in advance thanks of course to our troop to the country  s leadership and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for help u thanks to the russian people because the majority of the troop be russian and the troop suffer loss too i want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenian and in the name of all sumgait armenian for come in time and avert terrible thing bad would have happen if that mob have not be stop on time at present an investigation be be conduct on the part of the ussr procuracy i want to say that those bandit should receive the severest possible punishment because if they the tragedy the genocide could happen again everyone should see that the most severe punishment be meted out for such deed very many bandit and harden hooligan take part in the unrest in the mass disturbance the mob be huge at present not all of them have be caught very few of them have be i think judging by the newspaper report there be around 80 people near our building alone how many people take part in the pogrom of our building all in all they should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such act may 18 1988 yerevan reference 1 _the sumgait tragedy pogrom against armenian in soviet azerbaijan volume i eyewitness accounts_ edit by samuel

 center for policy research writes     your comparison with the warsaw ghetto uprise be insult and racist beyond belief the attempt to quiet any violence in the gaza strip be just that the effort to quell murder and mayhem in the gaza strip be the resluts of violence and come after the violence it be not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of jew jew have not commit act of violence and murder a have the resident of gaza i find your eagerness to ignore the act of murder nothing more than anti israel bigotry it be not punishment but protection from repeat attack by resident of gaza you self servingly omit any reference to why israel have have to take action apparaently the death of innocent israeli civilian do not enter into your equation a racist ommission on your part the right of israel to protect it citizen from murderer be also recognize by international law israeli civilian have be get stabbed to death on a daily basis if this wave of murder do not matter to you then your posturing for the basic human right you claim matter so much to you be nothing but an anti israel charade do you know of resident of gaza who have apply for israeli citizenship and be deny i have heard of no such denial take place can you document this or be this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda the truth be that if gazan resident apply for citizenship hamas would murder them a collaborator many gazans be born in town and village locate in how dare you use such a disgust phrase how very easy you attack a people when you omit fact which fly in the face of your pure racism perhaps you be judging a people to be the racist that you be do you believe that all jew must have the same bigoted makeup a you here  s another little fly in your ointment about the  master race for you to avoid     two month ago a plane with 86 bosnian muslim left bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east four arab nation refuse to grant them asylum then when israli arab agree to take the responsibility for them they be allow into israel yes israel but when the plane land the israeli arab who have previously agree to take care of them refuse to be involve with the rescue project because they felt that it would make israel look good it be more important to avoid any good pr for israel than to take care of fellow muslim israel move them to a kibbutz where they be safe and secure the truth be that time after time the islamic world have turn it back on muslim in need more than israel have even in the case of the 400 deportee lebanon be willing to let their so called arab brother freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in lebanon nearly twice a many palestinian have be murder by other palestinian than in confrontation with israel hundred of thousand of palestinian have be deport from kuwait just because they be palestinian the truth be that your phoney concern for the welfare of the palestinian be nothing but an excuse to attack israel you be part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the palestinian to attack israel but the truth be there be great reason than israel for the plight of the palestinian to disregard jordan or kuwait or saudi arabia or any of the other oil rich nation who do nothing for these people be to use the plight of these poor people a a vehicle for your hatred of jew or your hatred of israel anti semitism and anti zionism be not the same a pro palestinian and anyone who insists that it be the same really do not give two hoot for their welfare your pathetic analogy be so absent of relevant fact that your racism can not be disguise jew have never declare war on a polish people jew have never attack pole with knife or have use the ghetto a a stag ground for attack to take something like the warsaw ghetto the creation of which you do not even bother to discus and the uprise that follow be to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation be beyond your intellectual purview you clearly have never even read a single word of the covenant of the islamic resistance movement here be arguably the single most anti semitic genocidal document since mein kampf yet it be totally disregard in your ranting your racism be most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation if it be consider you might actually have to deal with mideast problem in a balance manner rather than in an anti semitic manner and just how be gaza obtain do you forget that israel be not in the habit of grab land for the hell of it but have take gaza in a war that it do not start do you know land israel capture in war war which other nation have always start the same a israel and they be subject to a completely different set of international law since you do continuously refer to international law would you please say what specific international law israel be violate this attitude i can cite 6 000 000 reason why it be not where be this quote i have never heard rabin assert that he wish such a thing since you be in general a liar have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort will be regard a just another one of your fabrication only you be lead to ask such a load racist intellectually dishonest question you inability to come to term with what you be have turn you into a racist of the high order why do you not feel the same compassion for the jew of iran or iraq or yemen or saudi arabia or syria do you have an inkling of what they have endure over the past decade or what about the plight of the palestinian in kuwait or what about the treatment of the bosnian muslim do you think the resident of gaza be be subject to what all the muslim in bosnia be endure why be you indifferent to the death and suffer of people why do you not care that these folk be be exterminate why do you not care that only israel have give any of these people safe haven could it be due to the fact that it be not israel who be do the kill the people in gaza be not be exterminate they be kill they be rap they be starve they be driven from their land they be not kept from receive food or other supply but the bosnians be and the only country which have provide some sanctuary to the bosnian muslim be the same nation that you have devote your life to attack in the guise of compassion your ranting be so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motif be do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion be what drive you in your case it be clear that hate beat out love every time maybe you be burden with some kind of guilt for have be born a jew it be obvious that your hatred of your own judaism be be dumped on all other jew why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding jew out of existence maybe these fit of anti semitism be a result of be cut off from your own people for an extend period whatever the case may be it be clear that you be not what you have labor so hard to appear to be when you realize that you care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good
 the comparison of the palestinian situation with the holocaust be insult and completely false any person make such a rude and false comparison be either ignorant of the holocaust or also ignorant of the situation in the mideast or be an anti semite

medical attendant there be an old armenian urshan told him what they have do to karina because s so proud she would never have told and this age armenian his name be uncle arkady i think because someone say    arkady get an injection ready    he start to fill a syringe and turn around so a to give karina a shot but when he look at her face he become ill  and he be an old man in his sixty his hair be all grey and his moustache too he hug karina and start to cry    what have they do to you    he be speak armenian    what have they do to you    karina say anything mamma come in then and she

heart medicine i think they give karina an injection and the doctor say that she have to be take to the maternity home immediately papa and urshan i think even though papa be in bad shape help carry karina out when they put her on the stretcher none of the medic get near her i know maybe there any orderly then they come to me    what  s the matter with you    their tone be so official that i wrap myself tighter in the half length coat i have a blanket on too an orange one aunt tanya  s i say    fine    uncle arkady come over and be soothe me and then told the doctor    you leave let a woman examine her    a woman come an azerbaijani i believe and say    what  s wrong with you    i be wear my sister lyuda  s nightshirt the sister who at this time be in yerevan when she be nursing her infant she have cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easy to breast feed the baby i tore the night shirt some more and show her i take it off my shoulder and turn my back to her there be a huge wound about the size of a hand on my back from the indian vase she say something to them and they give me two shot she say that it should be dress with something but that do that in the hospital they put me on a stretcher too they start look for people to carry me i raise up my head a little and want to sit up and this woman i know if she be a doctor or a nurse say    lie still you move    when i be lie back down i saw two policeman lead a man his profile seem very familiar to me i shout    stop    one of the policeman turn and say    what do you want    i say    bring him to me i want to look at him    they brought him over and i say    that person be just in our apartment and he just rap me and my sister i recognize him note it down    they say    fine    but write it down and lead him on i know where they be take him then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldier be sit they go to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer one of the soldier start talk to me    sister    i remember the conversation exactly but he ask me be we live and what they do to u i ask him    where be you from    he say that he be from ufa apparently they be the first that be brought in the ufa police later i learn that they suffer most of all he say    ok armenian they get along with you but a russian    he say    what be they try to kill me for    oh i remember something else when i go out onto the balcony with kuliyev for a hammer and nail i look out the window and saw two azerbaijani beating a soldier near the kindergarten he be press against the fence and he cover his head with his arm they be beating him with his own club the way he cry    mamma    make my skin crawl i know what they do to him if still alive or not and something else before he attack on our house we saw sheet clothes and some dish fly from the third or fourth floor of the neighbor building but i think it be azerbaijani attack armenian i thought that something be on fire or they be throw something they need out or someone be fight with someone it be only later when they be burning a passenger car in the yard when the neighbor say that they be do that to the armenian that i realize that this be serious that it be anti armenian they take karina and me to the sumgait maternity home mamma go to them too and say    be beaten too help me    but they just ignore her my father go to them and say in a guilty voice a though it be his fault that be beaten and say    my rib hurt so much those creep have probably broken my rib please look at them    the doctor say    not my job    urshan say    fine i  ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor i  ll find you one i  ll bring one and have him look at you and he drove them to his apartment marina and i stayed there they examine u i be more struck by what the doctor say than by what those azerbaijani in our apartment do to u i surprised when they beat u they want to beat u but i be very surprised that in a soviet medical facility a woman who have take the hippocratic oath could talk to victim like that by happy    or unhappy    coincidence we be see by the doctor that have deliver our karina and she have examine karina say    no problem you get off pretty good not like they do in kafan when you armenian be kill and rap our woman    karina be in such terrible condition that she say anything    she would certainly have have something to say then they examine me the same story they put u in a separate ward no shot no medicinal powder no drug absolutely none they even give u tea all the woman there soon found out that in ward such and such be armenian who have be rap and they start come and peer through the keyhole the way people look at zoo animal karina see this she be lie there and i kept her from see it they put ira b  in our ward she have also be rap true she have any serious bodily injury but when she told me what have happen at their place i felt bad for them than i do for u because when they rap ira her daughter be in the room she be under the bed on which it happen and ira be hold her daughter  s hand the one who be hiding under the bed when they be beating ira or take her earring off gold when she involuntarily let go of her daughter  s hand her daughter take her hand again her daughter be in the fourth grade s 11 year old i felt really awful when i heard that ira ask them not to harm her daughter she say    do what you want with me just leave my daughter alone    well they do what they want they threaten to kill her daughter if she get in their way now i would be surprised if the criminal have behave any other way that night it be simply bartholomew  s night i say they do what they would love to do every day steal kill rape many be surprised that those animal harm the child the beast explain it like this this would be repeat in 15 to 20 year and those child would be grown and then a they put it    come take the pleasure out of their life those child    this be about the girl that would be young woman in 15 year they be think about their tomorrow because they be sure that there would be no trial and no investigation just a there be no trial or investigation in 1915 and that those girl could be of some use in 15 year this i heard from the investigator one of the victim testify to it how they described their own nature that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 year and in 100 year    they themselves say that and this too everyone be surprised that they harm our marina many people say that they either be drunk or have smoke too much i know why their eye be red maybe because they slept the night before maybe for some other reason i know but they be smoking and they drunk positive because someone who have smoke will stop at nothing he have the urge to do and they spoke in a culture fashion with marina    little sister be afraid we harm you look over there where i be you might be frighten a muslim a muslim woman see such thing    so they be really quite sober so we come out of that story alive each every day we have live since it all happen bear the mark of that day it even a day of those several hour father still look u in the eye he still feel guilty for what happen to karina mother and me because of his nerve start talk  ing to himself heard him argue with himself several time when he thought no one be listen    listen    say    what could i do what could i do alone how could i protect them    i know where to find the word not that happy but i be glad that he see it all happen the only thing they spar u or maybe it happen by chance of course he know it all but there  s no way you could imagine every last detail of what happen and there be so many conversation karina and i spoke together in private and we talk with mamma too but father be never present at those conversation we spare him that if you can say that and when the investigator come to the house we speak with father present on february 29 the next clay karina and i be discharge from the hospital first they release me but since martial law have be declare in the city the soldier take me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier there be many people there armenian victim i met the tovmasian family there from them i learn that rafik and their uncle grant have die they be sure that both have die they be talk to me and raya rafik  s wife and grant  s daughter and her mother be both cry then they take u all out of the office on the first floor into the yard there  s a little one room house outside there a recreation and reading area they take u in there the woman be afraid to go because they thought that they be shoo u out of the police precinct because it have become so dangerous that even the people work at the precinct want to hide the woman be shout they explain to them    we want to hide you well because possible there will be an attack on the police precinct    we go into the little house there be no chair or table in there we have child with u and they be hungry we even have infant who need to have their diaper change no one have anything with them it be just awful they kept u there for 24 hour from the window of the one room house you could see that there be azerbaijani stand on the fence around the police precinct a though they be spy on u the police precinct be surround by a wall like a fence and electrify but if they be stand on the wall it mean the electricity be shut off this brought great psychological pressure to bear on u particularly on those who just walk out of their apartment but who slept for 24 hour or 48 or those who have suffer physically and spiritually the one who have lose family member for u it be another ordeal we be especially frighten when all the precinct employee suddenly disappear we see a single person not in the courtyard and not in the window we thought that they must have already be hiding under the building that they must have some secret room down there people be panic they start throw themselves at one another the way it be on a sinking ship we heard those people mainly young people whistle and whop on the wall we felt that the end be approach i be completely terrify i have left karina in the hospital and know where my parent be i be sort of calm about my parent i be think only about karina if heaven forbid they should attack the hospital they would immediately tell them that there be an armenian in there and something terrible would happen to karina again and she be able to take it then soldier with dog appear when they saw the dog some of the people climbed down off the fence then they brought in about another 30 soldier they all have machine gun in readiness their finger on the trigger we calm down a little they brought u chair and brought the child some little cot and show u where we could wash our hand and take the child to the toilet but we all sat there hungry but to be honest it would never have occur to any of u that we eat for two day and that people do eat then closer to nightfall they brought a group of detain criminal they be be watch by soldier with guard dog one of the men come back from the courtyard and told u about it raya tovmasian it be like a different woman have be substitute earlier she have be cry wail and call out    oh rafik    but when she heard about this such a rage come over her she jumped up she have a coat on and she start to roll up her sleeve like she be get ready to beat someone and suddenly there be soldier and dog and lot of people she ran over to them the bandit be stand there with their hand above their head face the wall she go up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and start to shake and thrash him then on to a second and a third everyone be root to the spot not one of the soldier move no one go up to help or make her stop her from do it and the bandit fell down and cover their head with their hand mutter something she come back and sat down and something akin to a smile appear on her face she become so quiet no tear no cry then that round be over and she go back to beat them again she be walk and curse terribly take that and that they kill my husband the bastard the creep and so on then she come back again and sat down she probably do this the whole night through well it really night no one slept she go five or six time and beat them and return and she told the woman    what be you sit there for they kill your husband and child they rap and just sit there sit and talk a though nothing have happen you armenian    she appeal to everyone but no one get up i be just numb i have the strength to beat anyone i could barely hold myself up all the more so since i have be stand for so many hour    i be release at eleven o clock in the morning and it be already after ten at night because there enough chair really it be the elderly and woman with child who sat i be on my foot the whole time there be nothing to breathe the door be close and the men be smoking the situation be deplorable at eleven o clock at night policeman come for u local policeman azerbaijani they say    get up they  ve brought mattress you can wash up and put the child to bed    now the woman want to leave this place either the place have become like home it be safe there be soldier with dog if anyone go outside the soldier would say    oh our little family    and thing like that the soldier felt this love and probably for the first time in their life perceive themselves a defender everyone spoke from the heart cry and hug them and they with their load machine gun in their hand say    grandmother you approach me on guard    our people would say    oh all right    they hug them one woman even kiss one of the machine gun this be all terribly move for me and the small child kept want to pet the dog they take u up to the second floor and say    you can undress and sleep in here be afraid the precinct be on guard and quiet in the city    this be the 29th when the kill be go on in block 41a and in other place then we be told that all the armenian be be gather at the sk club and at the city party committee they take u there on the way i ask them to stop at the maternity home i want to take karina with me i know what be happen there they told me    worry the maternity home be full of soldier more than mothers to be so you can rest assure i say    well i rest assure regardless because the staff in there be capable of anything    when i arrive at the city party committee it turn out that karina have already be brought there they have see fit to release her from the hospi  tal decide that she felt fine and be no longer in need of any care once we be in the city party committee we give free reign to our tear we met acquaintance but everyone be somehow divide into two group those who be injured who be clothed who have brought a pot of food with them and so on and those like me like raya who be wear whatever have come their way there be even people who be all make up dolled up like they have come from a wedding there be people without shoe naked people hungry people those who be cry and those who have lose someone and of course the story and the talk be fly    oh i heard that they kill him       what do you mean they kill him       he stayed at work       do you know what  s happen at this and such a plant talk like that and then i met aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian the teacher i know him very well and respect him highly know him for a long time they have a small room well really it be more like a study room we spent a whole night talk in that study once on march 1 we heard that bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr have arrive everyone ran to see bagirov what news he have brought with him and how this be all be view from outside he arrive and everyone go up to him to talk to him and ask him thing everyone be in a tremendous rage but he be protect by soldier and he go up to the second floor and deign to speak with the people apparently he have more important thing to do several hour pass gukasian call me and say    lyudochka find another two or three go to make up list they ask for them upstairs list of the dead those whose whereabouts be unknown and list of people who have pogrom of their apartment and of those whose car be burn    i have about 50 people in my list when they call me and say    lyuda your mamma have arrive s look for you she believe that you be alive and well and that here    i give the list to someone and ask them to continue what i be do and go off the list be imprecise of course it include grant adamian raya tovmasian s father who be alive but at the time they thought him dead there be engels grigorian  s father and aunt cherkez and maria the list also include the name of my girlfriend and neighbor zhanna agabekian one of the guy say that he have be told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmos movie theater we put her on the list too and cry but later it turn out that that be just a rumor that in fact an hour earlier she have somehow left sumgait for the marina and from there have set sail for krasnovodsk where thank god she be alive and well i should also say that in addition to those who die that list contain people who be rumor miss or who be so badly wound that they be give up for dead 3 all the list be take to bagirov i remember how many dead be contain in the list but a fact that when gukasian come in a couple of minute later he be curse and be terribly irate i ask    what  s go on    he say    lyuda can you imagine what animal what scoundrel they be they say that they lose the list of the dead piotr demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr have just arrive and we be suppose to submit the list to him so that see the scope of the slaughter of the tragedy whether it be one or fifty    they told him that the list have disappear and they should ask everyone who left for the khimik boarding house all over again there be 26 people on our second list i think that the number 26 be the one that get into the press and onto television and the radio because the list that demichev get i remember exactly that there be 26 people on the list i have even told aleksandr mikhailovich that that be only a half of those that be on the first list he say    lyuda please try to remember at least one more    but i remember anyone else but there be more than 30 dead of that i be certain the government and the procuracy count the people who die of fright like sick people and old people whose life be threaten by any shock they register a victim of the sumgait tragedy and then there may be people we know so many people left sumgait between march 1 and 8 most of them left for small town in russia and especially to the northern caucasus to stavropol and the krasnodarsk territory we have any information on them i know that there be people who set out for part around moscow in the periodical krestyanka woman farmer there be a call for people who know how to milk cow and for mechanic and driver and i know a whole group of people go to help out also clearly not on our list be those people who die enter the city who be burn in their car no one know about them except the azerbaijani who be hardly likely to say anything about it and there s more a great many of the people who be rap be not include in the list drawn up at the procuracy i know of three instance for sure and i of course know them all think of three woman whose parent chose not to publicize what have happen that be they take the matter to court they simply left but in so do they cease be victim one of them be the first cousin of my classmate kocharian she live in microdistrict no 8 on the fifth floor i tell you the building number and i know her name then come the neighbor of one of my relative she live in microdistrict 1 near the gift shop i know her name she life on the same land a the sumgait procurator they beat her father he be hold the door while his daughter hid but he hold the door forever and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbor they seize her by her braid like the azerbaijani be say it be a very culture mob because they kill anyone they only rap them and left and the third one i remember who the third one be anymore they transfer u on march 1  karina still herself yes we live for day in the sk in the cultural facility and at the khimik they live there and i live at the city party committee because i stay with karina it be too difficult for me but i be at peace she have survive i could already walk but really it be honest word that held me up thanks to the social work i do there i manage to persevere aleksandr mikhailovich say    if it for the work i would go insane    he and i put ourselves in gear and take everything upon ourselves someone have an infant and need diaper and free food and we go to get them the first day we bought everything although we should have receive it for free they be suppose to have be dispense free of charge and they sell it to u then when we found out it be free we go to krayev at the time fortunately you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor all the more so since everything be still clearly visible on our face krayev sent a captain down and he resolve the issue on march 2 they sent two investigator to see u andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev the way it work out in our family they have consider only karina and me victim maybe because she and i wound up in the hospital mother and father be consider witness but not victim shirokov be involve with karina  s case and bibishev with mine after i told him everything he and i plan to sit down with the identikit and record everyone i could remember while everything be still fresh in my mind we work with the identikit until the very last day because the condition there the investigative group work slowly and do poor quality work solely because the situation conducive to work there enough automobile especially during the time when there be a curfew and there be no typewriter for type transcript and no still or video camera i think that this be do on purpose not so poor that we supply our investigator with all that stuff it be do especially to draw out the investigation all the more so since the local authority saw that the armenian be leave at the speed of light never to return to sumgait and the armenian have a lot to say i come to an agreement with bibishev i told him myself    you worry if it take u a month or two month i  ll be here not afraid i look death in the eye five time in those two day i  ll help you conduct the investigation    he and i work together a great deal and i use this to shelter karina i give them so much to do that for a while they have the time to get to her so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to be her  self she be have difficulty breathing so we look for a doctor to take x  ray she eat or drink for nine day she be nauseous i eat and drank virtually nothing for five day then on the fifth day when we be in baku already the investigator told me    how long can you go on like this well fine so you want to eat you love yourself not take care of yourself but you give your word that you would see this investigation through we need you    then i start eat because in fact i be exhaust it enough that i kept see those face in our apart  ment in my mind every day i go to the investigative solitary confinement cell and prison i know we be just everywhere probably in every prison in the city of baku and in all the solitary confinement cell of sumgait at that time they have even turn the drunk tank into solitary confinement thus far i have identify 31 of the people who be in our apartment mamma identify three and karina two the total be 36  marina identify anyone she remembers the face of two or three but they among the photograph of those detain i told of the neighbor i recognize the one who go after the axe he still be detain still on the loose go and not clear if he will be found or not i know his first or last name i know which building he live in and i know his sister face but not in the city the investigator inform me that even if the investigation be close and even if the trial be over they will continue look for him the 31 people i identify be largely blue collar worker from various plant without education and of the very low level in every respect mostly their age range from 20 to 30 year there be one who be 48  only one of them be a student he be attend the azerbaijan petroleum and chemical institute in sumgait his mother kept try to bribe the investiga  tor once think that i be an employee and not a victim she say in front of me    i  ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 ruble and give you 600 in cash simply for keep him out of armenia    that be to keep him from land in a prison on armenian soil all terribly afraid of that because if the investigator be talk with a criminal and the criminal confess even though we identify him they tell him    in order to apply psychological pressure    they say    fine confess just keep silent when in an armenian prison when they find out who you be take care of you in short order    that somehow get to them many give in and start to talk the investigator and i be in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment a an investigative experiment it be only then that i saw the way they have left our apartment even without know who be in our apartment you could guess they stole for example all the money and all the valuable but take a single book they tore them up burn them pour water on them and hack them with ax only the material from the 27th congress of the communist party of the soviet union and james fenimore cooper  s last of the mohigans oh yes lunch be ready we be boil a chicken and there be lemon for tea on the table after they have be in our apartment both the chicken and the lemon be go enough to tell you what kind of people be in our apartment people who even know anything about book they take a single book but they do take worn clothing food and even the cheapest of the cheap worn out slipper of those whom i identify four be kafan azerbaijani living in sumgait basically the group that go seek    revenge       let  s use their word for it    be join by people seek easy gain and thrill seekers i talk with one of them he have gray eye and somehow against the back drop of all that black i remember him specifically because of his of his eye besides take part in the pogrom of our apartment he be also involve in the murder of tamara mekhtiyeva from building 16  she be an old armenian who have recently arrive from georgia she live alone and do not have anyone in sumgait i know why she have a last name like that maybe she be married to an azerbaijani i have laid eye on this woman only once or twice and know nothing about her i do know that they murder her in her apartment with an axe murder her enough for them they hack her into piece and threw them into the tub with water i remember another guy really well too he be also rather fair skinned you know all the people who be in our apartment be darker than dark both their hair and their skin and in contrast with them in addition to the grey  eyed one i remember this one fellow the one l take to be a lezgin i identify him a it turn out he be eduard robertovich grigorian born in the city of sumgait and he have be convict twice one of our own how do i remember him the name rita be tattooed on his left or right hand i kept think be that rita or    puma    which it would be if you read the word a latin character instead of cyrillic because the cyrillic    t    be the one that look like a latin    m     when they lead him in he sat with his hand behind his back this be at the confrontation he swore on every holy book try to put in an armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion and told me that i be make a mistake and call me    dear sister    he say    wrong how could i an armenian raise my hand against my own an armenian    and so on he spoke so convincingly that even the investigator ask me    lyuda be you sure it be he    i told him    i  ll tell you one more identify mark if wrong i shall apologize and say i be mistaken the name rita be tattooed on his left or right hand    he go rigid and become pale they told him    put your hand on the table    he put his hand on the table with the palm up i say    now turn your hand over    but he turn his hand over now this infuriate me if he have from the very start acknowledge his guilt and say that he want to do it that they force him or something else i would have treat him somewhat differently but he insolently stuck to his story    no i do not do anything it me    when they turn his hand over the name rita be in fact tattooed on his hand his face distort and he whisper something wicked i immediately flew into a rage there be an ashtray on the table a really heavy one make out of granite or something very large and it have ash and butt in it catch myself quite by surprise i hurl that ashtray at him but he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall and ash and butt rain down on his head and back and he smile when he smile it provoke me far i know how but i jumped over the table between u and start either pound him or strangle him i no longer remember which when i jumped i caught the microphone cord the investigator be there tolya  i no longer recall his last name and he say    lyudochka a japanese microphone please    and shut off all the equipment on the spot it be all be video taped they take him away i stayed and they talk to me a little to calm me down because we need to go on work i only remember tolya tell me    some actress what a performance    i say    tolya honestly    beforehand they would always tell me    lyuda more emotion you speak a calmly a if nothing have happen to you    i say    i have any more strength or emotion all my emotion be behind me now i no longer have the strength i have the strength to do anything    and he say    lyuda how be you able to do that    and when i return to normal drinking tea and watch the tape i say    can i really have jumped over that table i never jumped that high in gym class    so you could say the gang that take over our apartment be international of the 36 we identify there be an armenian a russian vadim vorobyev who beat mamma and 34 azerbaijani at the second meeting with grigorian when he have completely confess his guilt he told of how on february 27 the azerbaijani have come knock among them be guy    if you can call them guy    he knew from prison they say    tomorrow go after the armenian meet u at the bus station at three o clock    he say    no not come    they told him    if you come kill you    he say    alright i  ll come    and he go they also go to visit my classmate from our microdistrict kamo pogosian he have also be in prison i think that together they have either steal a motorcycle or dismantle one to get some part they need they call him out of his apartment and told him the same thing    tomorrow go to get the armenian be there    he say    no    they pull a knife on him he say    not go all the same    and in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed him several time in the stomach he be take to the hospital i know he be in the hospital in baku in the republic hospital if we have know about that we would have have some idea of what be to come on the 28th i  ll return to grigorian what he do in our apartment i remember that he beat me along with all the rest he spoke azerbaijani extremely well but he be very fair skinned maybe that lead me to think that they have it out for him too but later it be prove that he take part in the beating and burning of shagen sargisian i know if he participate in the rape in our apartment i see i remember but the people who be in our apartment who yet know that he be an armenian say that he do i know if he confess or not and i myself recall because i black out very often but i think that he participate in the rape of karina because he be in the apartment the whole time when they carry her into the courtyard he remain in the apartment at one point i be talk with an acquaintance about edik grigorian from her i learn that his wife be a dressmaker his mother be russian he have a father and that be convict twice well this will be his third and i hope last sentence he beat his wife she be eternally come to work with bruise his wife be an armenian by the name of rita the others who be detain well little beast you really call them beast just little beast they be robot carry out someone else  s will because at the investigation they all say    i understand how i could have do that i be out of my head    but we know that they be won around to it and prepared for it why they do it in the name of allah in the name of the koran in the name of propagate islam    holy to them    why they do everything they be command to do because i saw they have mind of their own not talk about their level of cultural sophistication or any high value no education they work have a slew of child without the mean to raise them properly they crowd them in like at the temporary housing and apparently they be promise that if they slaughter the armenian they would receive apartment so off they go many of them explain their participation say    they promise u apartment    among them be one who genuinely repent i be sure that he repent from the heart and that he just despise himself after the incident he work at a child  s home an azerbaijani he have two child and his wife work at the child  s home too everything that they acquire everything that they have they earn by their own labor and inherit from parent or grandparent and he say    i need anything i just know how i end up in that it be like some hand be guide me i have no will of my own i have no strength no masculine dignity nothing    and the whole time i kept repeat    now you imagine that someone do the same to your young wife right before your own eye    he sat there and just wail but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat be not detain he perform a marvelous disappear act but i think that get onto him they just have to work a little because that vadim that boy accord to his grandfather be in touch with the young person who taught him what to do how to cover his track he be constantly exchange jacket with other boy he knew and those he either and other thing a well and change himself like a chameleon so they get onto him but he be detain that one in the eskimo dogskin coat be at the gambarians after aleksandr gambarian be murder he come in and say    let  s go enough spill enough blood here    maybe karina know this but the reason they finish her off be that they be hop to take her home with them i heard this from aunt tanya and her son the kasumovs who be in the courtyard near the entryway they like her very much and they have decide to take her to home with them when karina come to at one point    she remember this yet this the neighbor old me    and she saw that there be no one around her she start crawl to the entryway they saw that she be still alive and come back they be already at the third entryway on their way to the gambarians they come back and start beating her to finish her if she have not come to she would have sustain lesser bodily injury they would have beat her less an old woman from our building aunt nazan an azerbaijani all but lay on top of karina cry and plead that they leave her alone but they flung her off the woman  s grown son be right nearby they picked her up in their hand and lead her home she howl and cry out loudly and swore god be on earth he see everything and he forgive this there be another woman too aunt fatima a sick age woman from the first floor s already retire mountain dweller and azerbaijani too have a custom if men be fight they throw a scarf under their foot to stop them but they trample her scarf and sent her home to trample a scarf be tantamount to trample a woman  s honor now that the investigation be go on now that a lot be behind u and we have gotten back to be ourselves a little i think about how could these event that be now call the sumgait tragedy happen how do they come about how do it start could it have be avoid well clear that without a signal without permission from the top leadership it would not have happen all the same not afraid to say this the azerbaijani let other worthy people take no offense the well representative of their nation let them take no offense but the azerbaijani in their majority be a people who be kept in line only by fear of the law fear of retribution for what they have do and when the law say that they could do all that like unleashed dog who be afraid they have time to do everything they threw themselves from one thing to the next so a to be able to get more do to snatch a bit more the smell of the danger be already in the air on february 27  you could tell that something be go to happen and everyone who have figure it out take step to avoid run into those gang many left for their dacha get plane ticket for the other end of the country just get a far away a their leg would carry them february 27 be a saturday i be teach my third class the director come into my classroom and say that i should let the child out that there have be a call from the city party committee ask that all teacher gather for a meeting at lenin square well i excuse the child and there be few teacher left at school altogether three woman the director and six or seven men the rest have already go home we get to lenin square and there be a great many people there this be around five thirty or six in the even no later they be say all kind of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below be support them stormily roar they spoke over the microphone about what have happen in kafan a few day earlier and that the driver of a bus go to some district have recently thrown a small azerbaijani child off the bus the speaker affirm that he be an eyewitness that he have see it himself  the crowd start to rage    death to the armenian they must be kill    then a woman go up on stage i see the woman because people be cling to the podium like fly i could only hear her the woman introduce herself a come from kafan and say that the armenian cut her daughter breast off and call    son avenge my daughter    that be enough a portion of the people on the square take off run in the direction of the factory toward the begin of lenin street we stood there about an hour then the director of school 25 spoke he give a very nationalist speech he say    brother muslim kill the armenian    this he repeat every other sentence when he say this the crowd support him stormily whistle and shout    karabagh    he say    karabagh have be our territory my whole life long karabagh be my soul how can you tear out my heart    a though an azerbaijani would die without karabagh     our territory the armenian will never see it the armenian must be eliminate from time immemorial muslim have cleanse the land of infidel armenian from time immemorial the way nature create it that every 20 to 30 year the azerbaijani should cleanse the land of filth    by filth he meant armenian i heard this before that i be listen to the speech closely many people spoke and i stood with my back to the podium talk shop with the other teacher and somehow it all go right by it penetrate that in fact something serious be take place then when one of our teacher say    listen to what say listen to what idiocy spout    we listen that be the speech of that director before that we listen to the woman  s speech right then in our group    there be nine of u    the mood change and the subject of conversation and all school matter be forgotten our director of study for whom i have great respect an azerbaijani before that i have consider him an upstanding and worthy person if there be a need to obtain leave we have ask him he seem like a good person so he tell me    lyuda you know that besides you there be no armenian on the square if they find out that an armenian tear you to piece should i tell them an armenian should i tell them an armenian    when he say it the first time i pretend not to hear it and then he ask me a second time i turn to the director khudurova and say that it be already after eight i be expect at home and i should be leave she answer    no they say that woman should stay here until ten o clock  and men until twelve stay here    there be a young teacher with u her child be in kindergarten and her husband work shift she ask to leave    i left my child at the kindergarten    the director excuse her when she let her go i turn around say    good bye    and left with the young teacher the azerbaijani i see them after that when we be walk the bus run and a crowd from the rally ran nearby u they have apparently gotten all fire up it must have become too much for them and they want to seek vengeance immediately so they rush off i afraid this time because i be sure that the other teacher say that i be an armenian to make it short we reach home then karina told of how they have be at the movie and what have happen there i start tell of my experience and again my parent understand that we be in danger we watch television a usual and even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day how it all be at the city party committee i met an acquaintance we go to school together zhanna i remember her last name she life above the housewares store on narimanov street she be there with her father for some reason she have a mother the two of them be at home alone while her father held the door she jumped from the third floor and she be lucky that the ground be wet and that there anyone behind the building when she go out on the balcony there be no one there they be all stand near the entryway that building be also a lucky one in that there be no murder there she jumped she jumped and feel any pain in the heat of the moment a few day later i found out that she stand up she have be injured somehow how people in sumgait save their life their honor and their child any way they could where it be possible the armenian fought back my father  s first cousin armen m  life in block 30  they found out by phone from one of the victim what be go on in town the armenian in that building all call one another immediately and all of them arm themselves with ax knife even with musket and go up to the roof they take their infant with them and their old woman who have be in bed for god know how many month they get them right out of their bed and take everyone upstairs they hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and wait ready to fight then they take the daughter of the school board director hostage s an azerbaijani who live in their building they call the school board director and told her that if she help them the 17 armenian on the roof to escape alive and unharmed s never see her daughter again sure of course that armenian would never lay a hand on a woman it be just the only thing that could have save them at the time she call the police the armenian make a deal with the local police to go into town two armored personnel carrier and soldier be summon they surround the entryway and lead everyone down from the roof and off to the side from the armored personnel carrier be a crowd that be on it way to the building at that very moment into block 30  how they defend themselves i heard that our neighbor roman and sasha gambarian resist big strong guy their father be kill and i heard that the brother put up a strong defense and lose their father but be able to save their mother one of the neighbor told me that after it happen when they be look for the criminal on march 1 to 2 and detain everyone they suspect people hid people in our entryway maybe people who be injured or perhaps dead the neighbor themselves be afraid to go there and when they go with the soldier into our basement they be suppose to have found azerbaijani corps i know how many even if they have be wound and put down there after two day they would have die from loss of blood or infection    that basement be fill with water i heard this from the neighbor and later when i be talk with the investigator the subject come up and they confirm it i know too that for several hour the basement be use to store object steal from our apartment and our neighbor carry out our carpet along with the rest he stole it for himself pose a one of the criminal everyone be take his own share and the neighbor take his too and carry it home and when we come back when everything seem to have calm down he return it say that it be the only thing of ours he have manage to    save    raya  s husband and father defend themselves the trdatovs defend themselves and so do other armenian family to be sure there be azerbaijani victim although never hear anything about them for some reason our government want to say that the armenian be not just victim but that they defend the honor of their sister and mother too in the tv show    pozitsiya    viewpoint a military man an officer say that the armenian do virtually nothing to defend themselves but not important the truth will come out regardless so the price we paid those three day for three day our courage our bravery and our humanity be test it be those three day and not the year and dozen of year we have live before them that show what become what we grow up to be those three day show who be who on that i will conclude my narrative on the sumgait tragedy it should be say that not over yet the trial be still ahead of u and the punishment receive by those who so violate u who want to make u into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigator the procuracy and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga  tion the price we paid to live in armenia to not fear go out on the street at night to not be afraid to say armenian and to not fear speak our native tongue october 15 1988 yerevan reference for 008 1 _the sumgait tragedy pogrom against armenian in soviet azerbaijan volume i eyewitness accounts_ edit by samuel

 i though when i be in israel i do make a point of listen to jtv news a well a monte carlo radio in the united state i generally read the nyt and occasionally a mainstream israeli newpaper what you may not be take into account be that the jp be no longer representative of the mainstream in israel it be purchase a few year ago and in the battle for control most of the liberal and left wing reporter walk out the new owner state in the past more than once that the jp  s task should be gear towards explain and promote israel  s position more than attack the gov t likud at the time the paper that i would recommend reading be middle stream and factual be    ha aretz    or at least this be the case two year ago and what about the    nat l enquirer    8  but seriously if one be to read some of the leftist newspaper one could arrive at other conclusion the information you receive be highly selective and extrapolate from it be a bad move

azerbaijan a tender to whale and penguin the committee for people  s help to karabakh of the academy of science of the azerbaijan ssr but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affair of the caucasus in the name of peace and democracy the armenian be christian the azerbaijani be moslem and islam be a religion especially unloved by the democrat westernizers besides at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claim on azerbaijan a consequence of which be the blood and suffer of innocent azeri people hundred of thousand of refugee and gross violation of human right recently armenian attack

who be    wrong    only that civilian be be use a cover and that have be place    in between    the israeli and the guerilla they  will  be injured a both party continue their fight the  purpose  of an army  s use of military uniform be  to set it member apart  from the civilian so that civilian will not be thought of by the other side a    combatant    so what do you think be the    meaning behind    the intention and the effect when an    army    purposely  does not be uniform but go out of it way to  look like civilian  they be judging that the benefit they will receive from this    cover    be more important that the harm that will come to civilian this be a comment on the israeli experience and be say that the guerilla  do  have some responsibility in put civilian in    the middle    of this fight by put on uniform and living apart from civilian barrack etc the guerilla would significantly low the risk to civilian but if the guerilla do this  they  put themselves at great risk absolutely they ask themselves    why set ourselves apart by wear uniform when there be a ready made cover for u civilian that make sense from their point of view but when this cover be use the guerilla should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilian i agree with you here i have always thought that israel  s bombing sortees and bombing policy be stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there be no reason that israel should passive wait until attacker chose to act there be every reason to believe that    take the fight  to  the enemy    will do more to stop attack a i say previously israel spent several decade    sit passively    on it side of a border and only act to stop these attack  after  the attacker have enter israeli territory it work very well the    host    arab state do little nothing to try and stop these attack from it side of the border with israel so the number of attack be considerably high a be their physical and psychological impact on the civilian caught in their path this be just another    selectively apply    statement the reason for this drawn out impasse between ababs palestinians and israeli be that neither side be willing to accept the word of the other by your criterion  everyone  should stay away from the negotiation that be precisely why the palestinian in their recent pisga proposal for the    interim    period after negotiation and lead up to full autonomy be demand condition that essentially define    autonomy    already they do not trust that israel will    follow through    the entire process and allow palestinian to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinian if you do then why should israel  s view of arabs palestinians be any different why should they trust the arab palestinians word since they they be very reluctant to give up    tangible asset land control of area in exchange for    word    for this reason they be also concerned about the sort of    guarantee    they will have that the arab will follow through on their part of any agreement reach absolutely so be the arabs palestinians ask first for the israeli    word    in relation to any agreement no what be be demand first be land when the issue be land and one party finally get hold of this    land    what the    other party    do be totally irrelevent if i now have possession of this land your word have absolutely no power whether israel chooses to keep it word do not get the land back while the    major armament    those allow people to wage    civil war    have be remove the weapon need to cross border attack still remain to some extent rocket attack still continue and    commando    raid only require a few easily conceal weapon and a refine disregard for human life yours of that of others such attack also continue bat guano the situation you call for exist in the 1970s and attack be commonplace there be no way these group can be effectively    disarm    unless the state be a authoritarian be syria  s the only other way be for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirror israel  s border secirity on it side it have to prove to isreal that it be this commit to protect israel from attack from lebanese territory what i say ok but that mean that syria have to    take over    lebanon i think israel or lebanon would like that what both    side    need be to receive something    tangible    the arabs  palestinian be look for    land    and demand that they receive it prior to give anything to israel israel have two problem 1 if it give up real  land  it be expose itself to a change geostrategic situation and that change help israel  s position and 2 when it give up this land it need to receive something in return to compensate for the increase risk

 from center for policy research cpr subject unconventional peace proposal a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle east                                                                                        by elia davidsson the follow proposal be base on the follow assumption 1  fundamental human right such a the right to life to education to establish a family and have child to human dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc be more important to human existence that the right of state 2  in the event of a conflict between basic human right and right of collectivities basic human right should prevail 3  between the collectivities define themselves a jewish israeli and palestinian arab however label an unresolved conflict exists 4  this conflict have cause great suffering for million of people it moreover poison relation between community people and nation 5  each year the united state expends billion of dollar in economic and military aid to the conflict party 6  attempt to solve the israeli arab conflict by traditional political mean have fail 7  a long a the conflict be perceive a that between two distinct ethnical religious communities peoples which claim the land there be no just nor peaceful solution possible 8  love between human being can be capitalize for the sake of peace and justice when people love they share have state my assumption i will now state my proposal 1  a fund should be establish which would disburse grant for each child born to a couple where one partner be israeli jew and the other palestinian arab 2  to be entitle for a grant a couple will have to prove that one of the partner posse or be entitle to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner although born in area under current isreali control be not entitle to such citizenship under the law of return 3  for the first child the grant will amount to 18 000 for the second the third child 12 000 for each child for each subsequent child the grant will amount to 6 000 for each child 4  the fund would be finance by a variety of source which have show interest in promote a peaceful solution to the israeli arab conflict include the u s  government jewish and christian organization in the u s  and a great number of government and international organization 5  the emergence of a considerable number of  mixed  marriage in israel palestine all of whom would have relative on  both side of the divide would make the conflict lose it ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society the existence of a strong  mixed stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middle east in a graceful manner objection to this proposal will certainly be voiced i will attempt to identify some of these 1  the idea of provide financial incentive to select form of partnership and marriage be not conventional however it be base on the concept of affirmative action which be recognize a a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effect of segregation and discrimination international law clearly permit affirmative action when it be aim at reduce racial discrimination and segregation 2  it may be object that the israeli palestinian conflict be not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict but that it be a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonize society that can only regain it freedom by arm struggle this objection be base on the assumption that the  enemy be not zionism a ideology and practice but israeli jewish society and it member which will have to be defeat this objection have no merit because it do not fulfill the first two assumption concern the primacy of fundamental human right over collective right see above 3  fundamentalist jew would certainly object to the use of financial incentive to encourage  mixed marriage from their point of view the continued existence of a specific jewish people override any other consideration be it human love peace of human right the president of the world jewish congress edgar bronfman reflect this view a few year ago in an interview he give to der spiegel a german magazine he call the increase assimilation of jew in the world a calamity comparable in it effect only with the holocaust this objection have no merit either because it do not fulfill the first two assumption see above 4  it may object that only a few people in israel palestine would request such grant and that it would thus not serve it purpose to this objection one might respond that although it be not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal the existence of such a fund would help mixed couple to resist the pressure of their respective society and encourage young couple to reject fundamentalist and racist attitude 5  it may object that such a fund would need great sum to bring about substantial demographic change this objection have merit however it must be remember that huge sum more than 3 billion be expend each year by the united state government and by u s  organization to maintain an elusive peace in the middle east through armament a mere fraction of these sum would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of  mixed marriage in israel palestine thus encourage the emergence of a non segregated society in that worn torn land i would be thankful for critical comment to the above proposal a well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment
 dear mr  beyer it be never wise to confuse    freedom of speech    with    freedom    of racism and violent deragatory    it be unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial distinction indeed i find the latter in absolute and complete contradiction to the former racial invective tends to create an atmosphere of intimidation where certain individual who belong to the group under target group do not feel the ease and liberty to exercise  their  fundamental    freedom of speech    this brand of vilification be not sanction under    freedom of speech salam john absood

 if you consider israeli reporting of event in israel to be propoganda then consider the washington post  s handle of american event to be propoganda too what make the israeli press inherently bias in your opinion i compare it to nazi propoganda either unless you want to provide some evidence of israeli inaccuracy or parallel to nazism i suggest you keep your mouth shut sick and tire of all you anti semite compare israel to the nazi and yes in my opinion if you compare israel to the nazi you be an anti semite because you know damn well it true and you be just try to discredit israel
 april 13 1993 response by al moore l629159 lmsc5 is lmsc lockheed com basically the problem be that israel may remain or leave the occupy territory it can not do both it can not do neither so far israe continue to propose that they remain the palestinian propose that they leave why should either change their view it be worth point out that the only area of compromise accomodating both view seem to require a reduction in the israeli presence israel proposes no such reduction     and in fact may be say to  not  be negotiate                                                                                                             tim there seem to be two perception that   have to be addressed   the first be that of israel where there be little trust for arab group so there be little support for israel give up   tangible   asset in exchange for piece of paper    expectation       hope    etc the second be that of the arab world palestinians where there be the demand that these    tangible concession    be make by israel   without   it receive anything   tangible   back give this the gap between the two stance seem to be the need by israel of receive some    tangible    return for it expect concession by    tangible    be meant something that 1 provide israel with    comparable    protection from the land it be to give up 2 in some way ensures that the arab state and palestine   will be   accountable and held actively not just    diplomatically responsible for the uphold of all action on it territory by citizen or    visitor    in essence i do not believe that israel objection to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near a strong a they be now if israel be assure that any new palestinian state  would be commit to   co existing with israel and held responsible for all attack on israel from it territory aside from some of the rather slant proposal above how  could  such    guarantee    be instill for example how could such    guarantee       control    be add to the palestinian pisga proposal israel be hang on largely because it be scar stiff that the minute it let go give land back to arab state no more    buffer zone    give full autonomy to palestinian any and or all of the arab party could and  would  if not    control    somehow easily return to the traditional anti israel position the question then be how to  really  ensure that that will not happen

 i would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until i express an opinion before decide i should be flame for it a for  war i be not sure how i would define it if you just look at attack on village then there be no way of decide when it start would you count the riot in the 20  s and 30  s violence but not war i personally think that  war a oppose to civil disturbance or whatever require organisation planning and some measure of regualr or semi regular force perhaps the arab liberation army count i could easily be convince it be so from what i know they do not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation the haganah and palmach certainly do that be not a cause for criticism it merely reflect the great organisation generally in the  zionist camp now you be be silly you in any case the war do not start with the invasion of the arab army you see we both agree on something and the previous poster be wrong no again i be not sure i doubt you want my opinion anyway but i think war require organisation a i say before it need a group to command and plan if fatah lauches rocket from southern lebanon and be you sure you have the right group not the moslem again then that sound like war to me stone throw do not joseph askew

 no you have completely misunderstood i be oppose to intervention in somalia for the same reason i be oppose to intervention in bosnia there be no security interest of the united state there which justifies risk the life of american serviceman and there be too many crisis in the world for u to take on all of them in the case of bosnia the risk be obviously much great and there be other country in a much well position and with far well reason to take action than the u you continue to misunderstand i do not say the reason why people want to intervene be because of racist you seem to be overly fond of use this word btw i say the phenomenon be race related which be not the same a racist perhaps this distinction be too subtle for you to grasp motif i say the attention and outrage at the entire yugoslavian situation be a result of it be 1 closer to home 2 happen to people we can identify with and 3 relentlessly harped on by the medium i never say anything about which side would be prefer which have a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factor i think there be no doubt that despite the fact we intervene in somalia the level of attention devote to there be considerably less than what be devote to bosnia if the newspaper and tv news i see be any guide

even though all our family survive when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawl even now among armenian among people who wish me only well i feel like all start over again i remember how that mob broke into our apartment my parent be stand in the hall my father have an axe in his hand and have immediately lock both of the door our door be rarely lock since friend and neighbor often drop by know a a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who be come to see u be azerbaijani jew or russian we have friend of many nationality even a turkmen woman my parent be in the hall my father with an axe i remember him tell my mother    run to the kitchen for a knife    but mother be detach pale a though she have decide to sell her life a bit dearer to be honest i never expect it of her s afraid of get shot and afraid of the dark a girlfriend be at the house that day a russian girl lyuda and mamma say    no matter what happens no matter what they do to u not to come out of the bedroom go to tell them that alone in the apartment    we go into the bedroom there be four of u marina and the russian girl crawl under the bed and we cover them up with a rug box of dish and karina and i be stand there and look at one another the idea that perhaps we be see each other for the last time flash somewhere inside me an emotional person and i express my emotion immediately i want to embrace her and kiss her a though it be the last second and maybe karina be think the same thing but s quite reserve we have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout there be so much noise from the tramp of foot from the shout and from excite voice i figure what be go on out there because the door to the bedroom be only open a crack but when mamma shout the second time karina ran out of the bedroom i ran after her i have want to hold her back but when she open the door and ran out into the hall they saw u immediately the only thing i manage to do be close the door behind me at least so a to save marina and her friend the mob be shout all of their eye be shin all red like from insomnia at first about 40 people burst in but later i be stand with my back to the door and see they come into the hall into the kitchen and drag my father into the other room he utter a word he just raise the axe to hit them but mamma snatch the axe from behind and say    tell them not to touch the child tell them they can do a they want with u but not to harm the child    she say this to father in armenian there be azerbaijani from armenia among the mob who broke in they understood armenian perfectly the local azerbaijani know armenian they need to speak it and one of them respond in armenian    you and your child both go to do the same thing to you and your child that you armenian do in kafan they kill our woman our girl our mother they cut their breast off and burn our house    and so on and so forth    and we come to do the same thing to you    this whole time some of them be destroy the house and the others be shout at u they be mostly young people under 30  at first there any old people among them and all of their face be unfamiliar sumgait be a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their face especially me a teacher so they drag my father into the other room they twist his arm and take him in there no they take him in there they drag him in there because he be already unable to walk they close the door to that room all but a crack we see what be happen to father what they be do to him then a young man about 26 year old start to tear off mamma  s sarafan and mamma shout at him in azerbaijani    old enough to be your mother what be you do    he struck her now be held mamma identify him i hope convict then they go after karina who  s be talk to them like a komsomol leader a though she be try to lead them down a different path a they say to influence their consciousness she told them that what they be do be wrong that they do it she say    come on let  s straighten this out without emotion what do you want who be you why do you come here what do we ever do to you    someone try to explain who they be and why they have come into our home but then the one in the back    more of them kept come and come    say    what be you talk to them for you should kill them we come here to kill them    they push karina struck her and she fell down they beat her but she cry out even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeat    what do we do to you what do we do to you    and even later when she come to she say    mamma what do we do to them why do they do that to u    that group be prepared i know this because i notice that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with u i remember that when they be beating me when they be tear my clothes off i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention be rivet to karina all i could do be watch how much they beat her and how painful it be for her and what they do to her why i felt no pain later when they carry karina off they beat her savagely really amaze that she not only live but lose her mind she be very beautiful and they do everything they could to destroy her beauty mostly they beat her face with their fist kick her use anything they could find mamma karina and i be all in one room and again i feel any pain just feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they do then one of those creep say that there enough room in the apartment they broke up the bed and the desk and move everything into the corner so there would be more room then someone suggest    let  s take her outside    those beast be in heaven they do what they would do every day if they afraid of the authority those be their true color at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they afraid of what would happen to them when they carry karina out and beat mamma her face be completely cover with blood    when i start to feel the pain i black out several time from the pain but each moment that i have my eye open it be a though i be record it all on film i think a kind person by nature but vengeful especially if someone be mean to me and i deserve it i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally cause me pain and every time i would come to and see one of those animal on top of me remember them and i  ll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me    forget    you have to forget you have to go on living at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that i hurt all over    i have be beaten terribly    i found the strength in myself to interfere with their torture i realize that i have to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffer to an end i push one of them away he be a real horse i remember now that be held too a though they be all wait for it they seize me and take me out onto the balcony i have long hair and it be stuck all over me one of the veranda shutter to the balcony be open and i realize that they plan to throw me out the window because they have already picked me up with their hand i be up in the air a though for the last time i take a really deep breath and close my eye and somehow brace myself inside i suddenly become cold a though my heart have sunk into my foot and suddenly i felt myself fly i figure out if i be really fly or if i just imagine it when i come to i thought now go to smash on the ground and when it happen i open my eye and realize that i be still lie on the floor and since i scream beg them at all they become all the more wild like wolf they start to trample me with their foot shoe with heel on them and iron horseshoe like they have spe  cially put them on then i lose consciousness i come to a couple of time and wait for death summon it beseech it some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment i need any of those thing i be sure that none of u would survive and i have even forgotten about marina and if none of u be alive it worth living there be a moment when the pain be especially great i withstood inhuman pain and realize that they be go to torment me for a long time to come because i have show myself to be so tenacious i start to strangle myself and when i start to wheeze they realize that with my death i be go to put an end to their pleasure and they pull my hand from my throat the person who injured and insult me most painfully i remember him very well because he be the old in the group he look around 48  i know that he have four child and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing something come over him then you see even during the investigation he almost call me    daughter    he apologize although of course he knew that never forgive him something like that i can never forgive i have never injured anyone with my behavior with my word or with my deed i have always put myself in the other person  s shoe but then in a matter of hour they trample me entirely i shall never forget it i want to do myself in then because i have nothing to lose because no one could protect me my father who try to do something against that hoard of beast by himself could do nothing and be able to do anything i knew that i be even sure that he be no longer alive and ira melkumian my acquaintance i knew her and have be to see her family a couple of time    her brother try to save her and so he try to kill her his very own sister he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffer when they strip her clothes off and carry her into the other room her brother knew what await her i know which one it be edik or igor both of them be in the room from which the axe be thrown but the axe hit one of the people carry her and so they kill her and make her death even more excruciate maybe the most excruciate of all the death of those day in sumgait i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians land his name be makhaddin he know my family a little he come to see how we have gotten settle in the new apartment in baku how we be feel and if we need anything a good person he say    you should praise god that you all survive but what i saw with my own eye i a man who have see so many people die who have live a whole life i    he say    nearly lose my mind that day i have never see the like of it and think i never shall again    the door to his apartment be open and he saw everything one of the brother threw the axe because they have already take the father and mother out of the apartment igor edik and ira remain he saw ira naked be carry into the other room in the hand of six or seven people he told u about it and say he would never forget it he heard the brother shout something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they be powerless to do anything but all the same they try to do something the guy who get hit with the axe live i i after i have be unsuccessful at kill myself i saw them take marina and lyuda out of the bedroom i be in such a state that i even remember my sister  s name i want to cry    marina    out to her but could not i look at her and knew that it be a familiar dear face but for the life of me remember what her name be and who she be and thus i save her because when they be take her out she a it turn out have told them that she have just be visit and that she and lyuda be both there by chance that they armenian lyuda  s a russian you can tell right away and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she be an azerbaijani and i almost give her away and doom her glad that at least marina come out of this all in good physical health although her spirit be murder at some point i come to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaintance in that mob he life in the neighbor building for some reason i remember his name maybe i sense my defense in him i call out to him in russian    igor help    but he turn away and go into the bedroom just then they be take marina and lyuda out of the bedroom igor say he knew marina and lyuda that marina in fact be azerbaijani and he take both of them to the neighbor and the idea stole through me that maybe igor have lead them to our apartment something like that but if he be my friend he be suppose to save me then they be strike me very hard    we have an indian vase a metal one they be hit me on the back with it and i black out    they take me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window they be already sure that i be dead because i react at all to the new blow someone say    s already dead let  s throw her out    when they carry me out onto the balcony for the second time when i be about to die the second time i heard someone say in azerbaijani    kill her i know her s a teacher    i can still hear that voice ring in my ear but i remember whose voice it be it igor because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent his mother be russian and they speak russian at home he speaks azerbaijani bad than our marina do i remember when they carry me in and threw me on the bed he come up to me that person and i have open my eye saw and recognize that person but immediately pass out cold i have be beaten so much that i have the strength to remember him i only remember that this person be old and he have a high position unfortunately i remember anything more what should i say about igor he treat me badly i have heard a lot about him that he that good a person that he sometimes drank too much once he boast to me that he have serve in afghanistan he knew that woman usually like bravery in a man especially if a man be in afghanistan if he be wound then about eighty percent sure that he will be treat very sympathetically with respect later i found out that he have serve in ufa and be injured but not in afghanistan of course i found that all out later among the people who be in our apartment my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization i know his last name his first name be najaf he be an armenian born azerbaijani but later karina so sure she be no longer a hundred percent sure that it be he she saw and she want to endanger him she say    he be there    and a little while later    maybe they beat me so much that i be confuse him with someone else no it seem like it be he    i be sure it be he because when he come to see u the first time he say one thing and the next time he say something entirely different the investigator summon him yet he come to see u in the khimik boarding house where we be living at the time he brought grocery and flower this be right before march 8th he almost start cry he be so upset to see our condition i know if he be put u on or not but later after we have told the investigator and they summon him to the procuracy he say that he have be in baku he in sumgait the fact that he change his testimony lead me to believe that karina be right that in fact it be he who be in our apartment i know how the investigator be now treat him at one point i wonder and ask and be told that he have an alibi and be not in our apartment he have go to baku and arrange an alibi not ruling out that possibility ill now return to our apartment mamma have come to you could say that she bought them off with the gold father give her when they be married her wedding band and her watch be gold she bought her own and her husband  s life with them she give the gold to a 14 year old boy vadim vorobyev a russian boy he speaks azerbaijani perfectly an orphan who be raise by his grandfather and who life in sumgait on nizami street he go to a special school one for mentally handicapped child but i  ll say this    a teacher all the same and in a matter of minute i can form an opinion    that boy be not at all mentally handicapped healthy he can think just fine and analyze too policeman should be so lucky and cunning too after that he go home and tore all of the picture out of his photo album he beat mamma and demand gold say    lady if you give u all the gold and money in your apartment let you live    and mamma told them where the gold be he brought in the bag and open it shook out the content and everyone who be in the apartment jumped on it start knock each other over and take the gold from one another surprised they kill one another right then mamma be still in control of herself she have be beaten up her face be black and blue from the blow and her eye be fill with blood and she ran into the other room father be lie there tie up with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face there be a broken table on top of the pil  low mamma grabbed father and he walk like me he be half dead halfway into the other world he comprehend anything see and be cover with black and blue mamma pull the gag out of his mouth it be some sort of cloth i think it be a slipcover from an armchair the bandit be still in our apartment even in the room mamma pull father out of lead him out of carry him out of we have two armchair in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen three people be stand next to that screen and into their shirt their pant everywhere imaginable they be shove shot glass and cup from the coffee service    mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye she say    i be afraid to turn around i just seize father and start pull him but at the threshold i hold him up he fell down and i picked him up again and drag him down the stair to the neighbor    mamma remember one of the criminal the one who have watch her with his face half turned toward her out of one eye she say    i realize that my death would come from that person i look him in the eye and he recoil from fear and go steal    later they caught that scoundrel meanwhile mamma grabbed father and left i be alone igor have take marina away mamma and father be go karina be already outside i know what they be do to her i be left all alone and at that moment i become someone else do you understand even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me all the same i somehow manage to hold out i go on fight them i bit someone i remember and i scratch another but when i be left alone i realize what kind of people they be the one i have observe the one who beat karina what kind of people they be the one who beat me that it be all unnecessary that i be about to die and that all of that would die with me at some point i take heart when i saw the young man from the next building i know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that we be from the same microdistrict when i saw him i say    neighbor be that you    in so do i place myself in great danger he realize that if i live i would remember him when he grabbed the axe the axe that have be take from my father i automatically fell to my knee and raise my hand to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have be well if he have struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery when he start get ready to wind back for the blow someone come into the room the newcomer have such an impact on everyone that my neighbor  s axe froze in the air everyone stood at attention

 this a    try and true    method utilized by guerilla and terrorist group to conduct operation in the midst of the local populace thus force the oppose    state    to possible harm innocent civilian in their search or in order to avoid the death of civilian abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover be  also  to blaim for drag the innocent civilian into harm  s way be you suggest that when guerilla use the population for cover israel should totally back down so     the easy way to get away with attack another be to use an innocent a a shield and hope that the other respect innocent life your damn right israel insists on some sort of    demilitarize    or    buffer    zone it have to put up with too many year of attack from the territory of arab state and watch a the state do nothing it be not exactly surprizing that israel decide that the only way to stop such action be to do it themselves what so the whole bit about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab state show that they be  prepared  to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some    guaratees    there be no way israel be go to accept their    word    not with their past attitude of tolerance towards    anti israel guerilla in residence    good lord brad what in the world goves you the idea that un troop stop anything they be only station in a country because that country allows them in it can ask them to leave  at any time  a nasser do in  56 and  67 somehow with that    limitation    on the troop    power    i think that israel be go to be any more comfortable without a  genuine  commitment to peace from the arab state and concrete not intellectual or political exercise in jargon    guarantee    by other party the un be worthless to israel but perhaps useful a a    ruse    perhaps you be aware that to most community of people there be the feel that it be well that    many of u die fight against those who attack u than for few to die while we silently accept our fate    if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffer few casualty i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic group from israel  s perspective    concession    get it nothing     except the realization that it have give    something    up and now  can only hope  that the other side decides to do likewise word  can be take back  by merely do so to    take back    tangible item land control of land require the sort of action you say israel should stay away from israel put up with attack from arab state territory for decade before essentially put a stop to it through it invasion of lebanon the entire basis of that reality be exactly a you state above 1 israel would express outrage at these attack and protest to the arab state involve 2 that state promptly ignore the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the act commit by    private group    3 israel would prepare for the next round of attack what would israel want to return to those day and be so idiotic a to suggest    trust    for the motivation of present day arab state ah ok     what be    different    about the present situation that tell u that the arab state will  not  pursue their past antagonistic policy towards israel now talk about vague    political factor    but about those    tangible    just like that which israel give up factor that    guarantee    the responsibility of those state your assessment of    difference    here be base on a whole lot of assumption and most state feel confortable base their existence on that sort of thing it have not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have be able to accomplish all that have occur once syria leaf who be to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stay thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim

 not aware that the u government considers me dangerous in any case that have nothing to do with the current case the claim against the adl be that it illegally obtain and disseminate information that be gather by state and or federal agency in the course of their standard interaction with citizen such a myself by that i refer to thing such a address and phone number vehicle registration and license information photograph etc you should ask the adl if you want an authoritative answer my guess be that they collect information on anyone who do or might engage in political criticism of israel i far believe that they do this a agent of the israeli government or at least in agreement with them at least some of the information collect by the adl be pass on to israeli official in some case it be use to influence or attempt to influence people  s access to job or public forum these matter will be brought out a the court case unfolds since california law entitles people to compensation if such action can be proven a my previous post show california law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequence    just for the far dissemination of certain type of private information about them

trolleybus administration resident at building 4 21 apartment 29 block 14 narimanov street sumgait azerbaijan i spent almost all of february do overhaul the 27th be a short day at work we work until eleven or eleven thirty and left for home i decide to go for a short walk i go to primorsky park i walk past the eternal flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people stand there when i have walk another 15 to 20 yard i heard the screech of automobile brake behind me i turn my head toward the sound it be a light blue gaz 24 volga i see that the people who be stand there have go over to the car a man and a woman get out the man be expensively dress in a suit and the woman have a raincoat on she have anything on her head and her hair be let down sightly reddish hair a heavy set woman 40 to 45 year old they get something out of the trunk the people start to help them i become curious just what be they pull out of there when i get up close i heard them turn something on i see what it be but it be probably a tape recorder they put it on the ground near the eternal flame honor the 26 baku commissar and form a tight circle around it i ask    what  s go on    someone tell me    come listen    well they be azerbaijani i have ask in azerbaijani i hear appeal    brother muslim our time have come    and something else along that line i understand what it be all about i walk around the group try to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder but the circle drew in tighter new people start come from various direction five here seven there and the comment start    right we should slaughter the armenian    and    there s no need to be afraid all of moscow be behind u    i even heard that    all moscow be behind u    well i watch and listen in and realize that this be no joke i quietly left and go home now before that at work i have heard that something be go on in karabagh that there be demonstration there well people be say all kind of thing but i have any idea what be really go on my wife and son be at home but my daughter be at my aunt  s house in baku i say anything to my wife we sat and drank tea sometime around two o clock right behind our house suddenly there be noise whistle and shout i look out the window and saw a crowd the crowd be move slowly like they show on tv when black in south africa be strike or have a demonstration and move slowly my wife asks what  s go on out there i say i know i put on some outdoor clothes and go out to find out what it be all about in the crowd people be shout    down with the armenian    and    death to the armenian    i wait for the entire crowd to pas at first they go down narimanov street on the side with the sk club and the city party committee then they turn and go against the traffic    one way there    down the street of the 26 baku commissar toward the streetcar line i go home and told my wife there be a demonstration go on in fact i thought that we be have the same kind of demonstration that they have have in yerevan and in karabagh aside from the thing they be shout i be surprised that there be only young people in the crowd and they be minor under draft age my wife and son want to go upstairs to visit a friend but i be kind of uneasy and say    no let  s stay at home instead    an hour go by or maybe an hour and a half well i keep track of the time i say exactly how long it be i look and see another crowd on narimanov but now on the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the rossiya movie theater i put outside clothes on and go out again there  s noise an uproar outside and the crowd have grown there be more people and whereas the first time there be individual shout this time they be more focus more aggressive no i think something  s wrong here this any demonstration they would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dash and then run again i be walk along the sidewalk and they be in the street i follow them i be think just watch and see who knew where this be lead we come out on lenin square at the square the sk club be on one side and the city party committee be on the other i go toward the square and heard noise and shout a though the whole town have turn out there be some sort of a rally go on i go closer and hear exclamation appeal i heard both anti armenian and anti soviet appeal    we need perestroika we want to go on living like we have be    now what do they mean by    living like we have be    the azerbaijani work like everyone else but too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others speculation theft and cheat go on all the time and not just in azerbaijan everywhere in all the republic but never see it anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan now at this rally someone say that they should go around to the armenian apartment and drive them out beat them and drive them out true i hear them say    kill them    over the microphone i only heard    beat them and drive them out    i stayed at the square a few minute longer first one then another be go up onto the stage and no one try to stop the crowd off to the side of the crowd there be small group of three or four people and i think they be mvd ministry of internal affair or state security kgb there be also uniformed policeman there but i see any of them try to pacify the crowd new people kept come up onto the stage well i have finally decide that this could end badly this be no demonstration and i have to protect my family i left the square to return home and suddenly notice a truck it be next to the city party committee on narimanov street it stood next to the tai  lor  s shop there a low truck and it have low wooden panel i see that some  thing be be unloaded crate of some sort i decide to go look because after all those appeal i be apprehensive and thought there might be weapon in there they pull the crate out onto the square not toward the city party committee but toward the sk club and when i go right up to them i saw that they be case of vodka there be two people hand down the case from the bed of the truck and on the ground there be many people 15 to 20  they be hand them down from the truck and each case be carry off by two people two people one case of vodka and there be a man stand right next to the truck and he be hand out roundish black lump maybe about the size of a fist maybe a little big or small it be anasha when i pass next to that person he stood with his side to me there be about a yard and a half between u and two people be stand near him he have a package in his hand and pull out anasha and hand it out i have never smoke it myself once i try it for fun but see a lot of people smoke it see it many time and i know what it be i stroll around and no one ask me who i be or what i be do there before i get to the glass bazaar i heard more howl more warlike shout i turn around and saw them run well i  ll just keep on go like i be i thought when they caught up with me i saw that they be carry flag and i recognize the person who be carry the flag on my side of the street a young guy 21 or 22 year old he be carry a red flag which have    ermeni oryum    write on it in azerbaijani that mean    death to armenian    that guy use to live off the same courtyard a u i really know what his name be but i know his father very well his father  s name be rafik he use to be a cook and then become head chef he use to have a dark blue zhiguli van then he sell it and now he have a white zhiguli 06  his family a i say live on the same courtyard a we do our building be on narimanov street and theirs be on the street of the 26 baku commissar their apartment be in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the left now rafik  s little brother life there and he rafik i heard get a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict in a word his son be carry a flag that say    death to armenian    i be surprised because before this i have gotten the impression that all of this nonsense be be do not by people from sumgait but by azerbaijani from agdam and kafan well anyway i go home my wife be upset i told her    ok it  ll pas young kid they  ve just gotten all whoop up    naturally i want her to get overly upset after a while a new surge of crowd go by and this time they be break glass i could hear it break but i see where well i think here we go the machine  s in motion they hand out that vodka and anasha for nothing i see people drinking and smoking on the spot but they certainly unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window so the thought flash through my head that the machine be run no one would stop them now they even try although i  ll say it again the police be there i saw them and not just that the police break them up they be joking with them they be have a good time true at the time i even imagine that under our government our much  vaunt leadership    and not afraid to say these word so many people die so many woman be abuse and how many abomination there be    i imagine that under our much vaunted authority and if i be to be specific i would say under the much touted authority in our city of sumgait i imagine that such thing could take place when they start break glass i told my wife and son    let  s go upstairs    we go to our neighbor the grigorians on the fourth floor and in the even when those crowd start go past again i go outside once more i stop at    the corner    a place call that right next to the bazaar i look and see a crowd on the run and there a few yard from the entrance to the bazaar be three respectable looking men of around say 50 year old the crowd be run and one of the three wave with his arm and point toward the bazaar and then the whole crowd a though it be one person wheel and race toward the bazaar and not a soul go past those three a though it be off limit well everything get all churn up there be more noise and the glass be fly again we spent the night at the neighbor my apartment be on the first floor there be really no way to defend yourself there in the morning i go out to buy bread and to see what be happen in town on the way i saw someone hunch up still i never found out who it be or what happen to him there be 10 to 15 people stand near him i get the bread and on my way back they have gather around the person who be lie there hunch up sort of enclose him because of the way they be stand you even see him that be on the morning of february 28  everyone know the rest may 17 1988 yerevan reference 1 _the sumgait tragedy pogrom against armenian in soviet

 i know it make sense but since when be  napoleon about sense anyway far strike bigoted and racist attitude of certain greek still exists in our day most greek insist even today that the 537 year old capital of the ottoman empire should be call not by it rightful name of istanbul but by it half a millennium old moniker  cons  whatever everyone know that new york city be once call  new amsterdam  but dutch people do not persist on call it that today the name of stalingrad too be long go replace by volgagrad china s peking trade it name for beiging long ago ciudad trujillo of the dominican republic be now santa domingo zimbabve s old colonial capital salisburry become harrare these change have all be accepted officially by everyone in the world but greek be still determine on call the turkish istanbul by the name of  cons  how can one explain this total intransigence what make greek so different from other mortal 18 year old questionable democracy why they seem to reconcile with the fact for instance that istanbul change hand 537 year ago in 1453 ad and that this predates the discovery of the new world by 39 year the declaration of u s  independence in 1776 will come 284 year later then half a millennium be consider enough time for  cons  to be call a turkish city where be the logic in the greek reason if there be any how long can one sit on the laurel of an ancient civilization ancient greece do not exist any more than any other 16 civilization that exist on the soil of anatolia these undereducated  wieneramus live with an illusion it be the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that cyprus be a greek island no history book show that it ever be it belong to the ottoman turk  lock stock and barrel for a period of well over 300 year in fact prior to the turk acquisition of it follow bloody naval battle with the venetian in 1570 ad the island of cyprus belong invariably to several nation the assyrian the sumerian the phoenician the egyptian the ottoman turk of course in that order own it a their territory but it have never be the possession of the government of greece not even for one day in the history of the world moreover cyprus be locate 1500 mile from the greek mainland but only 40 mile from turkiye  s southern coastline saddam hussein claim that kuwait be once iraqi territory and the greek cypriot government and the terrorist greek government think that cyprus also be once part of the greek hegemony those  arromdians involve in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydream and confront reality again wishful think be unproductive only fact count a for selanik those jew who survive these assault in southeastern europe flee particularly to salonica whose jewish population increase substantially a a result from 28 000 in 1876 to 90 000 in 1908 more than half the total population though even there increase persecution by local greek lead many jew to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire particularly to the great port of izmir despite all the pressure from ottoman and foreign jew alike the ritual murder and other assault by christian on jew go on and on greek effort to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminate in 1912 and 1913 follow greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war when many of it jew be either kill or terrorize into leave     though greece be obligate by the post world war i treaty to allow jew and other minority to use their own language in education and to practice their religion without hindrance a law be issue in 1923 which forbad all inhabitant from work on sunday stimulate a new jewish exodus a it be intend to do between 1932 and 1934 there be a series of anti semitic riot in salonica with the cambel quarter where most of the remain jew live be burn to the ground this be follow by regulation require the use of greek and prohibit hebrew and judea spanish in the jewish school a start be make also on expropriate the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica for use by the new university in order to derive the jew out 47 by kill and drive out large number of jew the greek left a substantial greek majority in the city for the first time and start salonica jewry on the way to it final decimation by the nazi during the occupation of greece start in 1941  salonica and izmir of course be not the only place of refuge for jewish refugee enter the empire during it last century of existence istanbul edirne and other part of rumelia and anatolia receive thousand more nor be jew the only refugee receive and help by the government of the sultan thousand of muslim accompany them in flight from similar persecution wherever balkan christian state gain independence or expand the russian conquest of the crimea and the caucasus start in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the crimean war combine with the same independence movement in southeastern europe that have cause so much suffer and flight among it jew cause thousand of helpless ill and poverty stricken muslim refugee to accompany them into the ever shrink boundary of the ottoman empire with the istanbul government struggle mightly but vainly to house and feed them a best it could from 1850 to 1864 a many a 800 000 crimean tatar circassian and other muslim from north and east of the black sea have enter anatolia alone a many a 200 000 more come during the next twenty year while 474 389 refugee enter in 1876  1877 a a result of the ottoman war with russia and the balkan state with an equal number gain refuge in the

 if the attack be justified or not be at least debatable but this be not the issue the issue be that you be cheer death read again your original article you find israeli government responsible for those dead soldier a reasonable debatable point but feel satisfaction from dead body be not reasonable by any standard no matter how you try to justify it i may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in s lebanon but no matter what you say i can not understand your satisfaction for dead body i have a question for you let  s assume a bosnian village inhabit by serb untill a few 10 20 year ago and later take over by bosnian muslim the mean be not very peaceful now do you enjoy serb come and kill all arm bosnian muslim i would not enjoy but i would not enjoy any dead body israeli lebanese or bosnians

 the village i described be actually the closest i could come to describe mine i agree there may be other village where the civilian population have desert because it be too close to israeli line and thus get bombed more often in such village often the only remain inhabitant be guerilla and some elderly who have nowhere else to go but for the most part the typical south lebanon village be more like mine one where civilian and guerilla live together they be often inhabit the same house many family be large some have member of the family involve in hizollah most others be not that be what be so hard of south lebanon israel be not fight an army with well drawn battle line but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blend with the local populace not because they be evil coward that use woman and child a shield but because that be the only way one can fight a more powerful well equip occupy army hizbollah and amal be now the main two militia though hizbollah people tend to be more commit to resistrance operation and well motivate by religious conviction a to retaliation it may be a mixture of what we both say sometimes israel chooses it target carefully at other time it just sends it pilot on sortie aim at a town in general since it only know that the attacker come from that specific village but have no far intelligence on several occasion israel retalliated against civilian refugee camp even in north lebanon just to show that it will not sit idly after it soldier have be attack most of the time it directs the sla to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some lebanese village on the other side i have experienced this shell myself on several occasion this be why the sla militia be sometimes even more despise than israeli troop i hope you be right on israeli willingness to withdraw but i still contend that withdrawal would be the well course for israel s security since it would reduce it military loss and i claim that the lebanese and syrian gov ts would be able to prevent any far attack on northern israel hmm     here we disagree on what serf syria interest well i think syria want to have lebanon all to itself it would be willing to guarantee northern israel  s security in return for israeli withdrawal i think syria want israel to be involve in it protectorate of lebanon syria be sit at the negotiate table because it have come to accept that and want to get a political resolution a renewal of hostility along the lebanese front could put the whole me peace negotiation back in question i agree that the loss of any human life be deplorable and regrettable

 contrary to what the    protocol of zion crowd    might suggest judaism do not have any such goal the question you ask be complicate and deserves an honest answer i be go to provide one from my own current perspective not a historical one currently a a non observant jew israeli american my own feel be that jew from the diaspora do not have a great right in palestine or israel than the palestinian or israeli both arab and jew do with regard to jewish israeli they should have the same right in israel a do all other israeli who be them if by them you mean the non religious jew i think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settler and their supporter be religious the other part of the problem be to my knowledge not that the palestinian want to be a part of israel a much a they would accept for the most part be full citizen of israel with all the priviliges and responsibility accord israeli citizen what they object to be the current limbo in which they find themselves

 account of anti armenian human right violation in azerbaijan 012 prelude to current event in nagorno karabakh                                                                                        i saw a naked girl with her hair down they be drag her she kept fall because they be push her and kick her she fell down it be muddy there and later other witness who saw it from their balcony told u they seize her by the hair and drag her a couple of block a far a the mortgage bank a good block and a half or two from here i know this for sure because i saw it myself                                                                                        deposition of tatyana mikhailovna arutunian nezhintseva born 1932 train conductor azerbaijani railroad resident at building 13 15 apartment 27 microdistrict no 3 sumgait azerbaijan i live very long in sumgait only eight year i move there from novosibirsk my son enter the baku nautical school and so i transfer to azerbaijan later i met someone and married him and now my name be arutunian my husband  s name that there would be a massacre be not discuss openly but there be hint and gibe so to speak at the armenian people and they be mock the russian too i be constantly aware of it at work and not just this past year i find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because i i  ll just say it steal deceive and be involve in bribe taking and when i ask for decent work condition they told me    leave keep the others from work you cut out for this kind of work    and at work and around all the time i would hear gibe at the armenian like    the turk have it right they kill them all    the way they  ve multiply here make it hard for u to live    and    thing will be just fine if we get rid of them all       no problem the turk will help    they say    if we ask them rid armenia of armenian in half an hour    well the way it all be but i never thought of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just imagine it here be living under the soviet government for 70 year and no one even consider such an idea possible but i have be form my own opinion and in the presence of authoritative people i would often ask    where be this all lead do people really not see what kind of situation be emerge here the russian be flee sumgait there be very few of them left why be no one deal with this what  s go on    and when it all happen on the 27th and 28th it become clear that everything have be arrange by someone because what else be you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee be march ahead of the demonstration with an azerbaijani flag i be say this now if i receive personal confirmation from him later because when we be under guard in the sk club on the 1st he come to the club that muslimzade the woman told me    there he be there he be muslimzade    i believe the rumor that he have carry an azerbaijani flag i thought that they be just false rumor i go over to him and say    be you the first secretary of our city party committee    he answer me    yes    and i ask him    tell me do you really march ahead of that gang carry an azerbaijani flag and behind you they be carry denigrate sign i know exactly what they say but there be mention of armenian blood    and he tell me    yes i be there but i try to dissuade them from it    then i ask him another question    and where be you when they be burning and slaughter u and he say    i  we know what to do we know we anticipate that that would happen in sumgait    comrade mamedov the first deputy chairman of the council of minister of the azerbaijani ssr answer the same question for me    no we actually anticipate the slaughter in sumgait at that time we be try to contain the crowd of 45 000 in baku that be prepare for a massacre    those be his exact word the one he say in the office of the council of minister of the armenian ssr and now about the event themselves of course painful to discus them because it may seem that not true to someone else various rumor concern what happen be make the round some be true others but unfortunately there be more true one than false because it be so horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress i know if someone have told me this story if i be living in or around moscow i have believe it why not because it be really a genocide it be a massacre genuinely what it be for example on that day the 28th    i know about the 27th because my husband and i be both sick both of u have the flu and we be in bed    on the 28th our neighbor come to our place and say    in bed you know anything about it there be a demonstration in town and after it they be overturn armenian car and burning them they be look into car and ask  are you an armenian if they answer in armenian then they turn the car over and burn it    this make up the wife of the senior investigator of the baku ministry of internal affair told u he be return home from his dacha with his wife raisa sevastyanova s my neighbor she immediately come and told li that they have land right in the middle of it i know what to call it the cavalcade of automobile they be stop he answer in azerbaijani they let them go but they make him honk the horn they be kick up a fracas we even believe it and i say    certainly that happen how can that be    and she say    muslimzade be lead the crowd and the sputnik store be completely smash because most of the salesperson there be armenian and when he saw that they have start break the glass in that store he say    break the shop window destroy state property but do whatever else you want     i hear this with my own two ear but it be a fact that the store be torn up and the director of the store be beaten for employ armenian although an azerbaijani while we be talk all of a sudden right across from u sevastyanova be the first to look out the window and say    look there  s a crowd out there    and sure enough when we look out there we saw that the crowd have already start wreck the neighbor building there be an armenian family there a woman and two girl they live across from u sorry i know the building number or the people  s name since we be in my husband  s apartment in microdistrict 8 and i live in microdistrict no 3  there be awful loot go on there at the time the most hideous thing be go on there then one building there ours be attack twice once enough for them they return to the place where they finish the armenian off if an azerbaijani family dare to conceal armenian they beat the azerbaijani too they also beat russian if it be russian do the hiding because there be russian among them they say so on television there be people of various nationality but they tell u why there be people of different nationality because they have touch the azerbaijani if they dare to stick up for the armenian and give them temporary shelter in their home at the time i saw this from the window i be there sevastyanova be there and so be my husband we go out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony all kind of thing even a sofa then when it be all down there they burn it up then we saw the crowd and they be all ooh at first i figure out what be happen and later i told my husband    lendrush l think beating someone out there    and he answer    i know could be    suddenly the crowd separate for a moment and i saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too my husband have turn the other way he see it i saw a naked girl with her hair down they be drag her she kept fall because they be push her and kick her she fell down it be muddy there and later other witness who saw it from their balcony told u they seize her by the hair and drag her a couple of block a far a the mortgage bank a good block and a half or two from here i know this for sure because i saw it myself then the crowd rush toward our building we be stand there and you can of course imagine what we be feel be they go to kill u or not and i also have the awful thought that they might torment me the way they torment that woman because i have just see that i ask my husband i give him an axe and say    you kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse    but our neighbor true defend u they say    there any armenian in our entryway go away only muslim live here    disaster miss u that time but at two o clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people approximately come back to our place my husband be already asleep he can sleep when upset about something but i i be stand run from balcony to balcony our power be out i remember for how long but it be a though it have be deliberately turn off there be no light whatsoever and i be glad of course i thought it be well that way but then i look and the crowd be at our balcony this be at 2 15 in the morning the first time they be at our building it be 6 30 and now it be 2 15 in the morning but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani be awake and watch out there be human being among them too so she go out with a pail of garbage a though she need to be take garbage out at two o clock in the morning she use it a a pretext and go toward those young people they really be youngster from my balcony you could see perfectly that they be young azerbaijani boy they spoke azerbaijani and when they come up to her she say    what do you want    and they answer    we want the armenian family that life here    point toward the second floor with their hand she say    i already told you we have any armenian here now leave do you hear this be an old muslim woman talk to you    and grabbed the hand of one boy who be try to walk around her and enter the building anyway and start push him away and so they seem to listen to her they be all very young they start apologize and left that be the second time death be at our door i forgot to mention about one other apartment a man name rubik life there i know him really i knew his daughter i mean i saw her around but we really know them but i do know that that guy who life on the fourth floor across from our entryway go to chernobyl and work there for eight month to earn money can you imagine what that mean he risk his life to earn x amount of money in order to well his family he bought new furniture and be get ready to give his daughter  s hand in marriage but ala everything be ruin by those creep and scoundrel they threw everything out the window and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbor on the left and right ran into the apartment and carry off everything that already be smash or take what be one to think of that it mean that the parent in those family be in on it too unfortunately i come to be of the opinion that it be all organize and that everything have be foreseen in advance both the beating of the armenian and the strip of apartment something on the order of    move the armenian out and take over their apartment    i have work honestly my whole life you can check everything about me i come a a patriot from china wait for night on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr i come to my homeland a a patriot because i knew that the party and the komsomol be holy thing but when i saw in sumgait that there anything holy about them that party membership be bought that komsomol member join only for personal gain that there be no ideal no idea god save me everything be be bought and sell i saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it do i talk any more about it the image of that beating when i go out of my own apartment    they picked u up under soviet army guard they have arrive from all over to suppress that gang    not only armenian but some russian family and their child too come out of their apartment and join u because no normal person who have see that could stay there with the situation the way it be and what  s interest be that when we left on the bus i rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the armenian would somehow understand the injustice of what be do but have analyze and weigh the whole thing once i calm down have thought it all through i come to a conclusion that be share by many people if a lot of azerbaijani want their armenian neighbor to be kill and that basically depend on that muslimzade    he say that he have want to calm them down    then be it possible that he have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute    go and announce it on television citizen of sumgait take what you can into your hand let  s protect our neighbor from this massacre    those crowd such that there be no control them basically they be unarmed they have firearm mostly they have knife they have all kind of metal part like armature shaft sharpen at the end special rock different to a degree that we notice them there rock like those in sumgait soil they be brought from somewhere a though it be all specially plan so a i be say i weigh it all out and if any of our neighbor have want to defend u why it arrange it mean that the government want to do it when the crowd be move from the city party committee to the sputnik what there be no way of inform baku no there be no way it turn out the crowd be do violence in our microdistrict i mention the thing i see myself i  ll only talk about the thing i myself witness they be in microdistrict 8 begin at 6 o clock in the even when i saw them from the other building and they be somewhere else until mid night or one o clock in the morning because at 2 15 they come back to our building they completely finish make their predatory round of microdistrict 8  when they return to our building i told my husband    lendrush now the police be probably go to come my god now the authority be probably go to find out and come to our aid    well ala no there be to be no authority not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single ambulance come while they be rag a it turn out a we later found out begin on the might of the 27th there be dead people ruin apartment and burn auto one car near the bus station it be burn and overturn it be probably there about four day everyone saw it and what go on in block 45 those who live there know they saw from their balcony how they attack the soldier in the bus how they beat those poor unarmed soldier and how on that square i remember the name of it where there be that fork come from the bus station that intersection now upset and i think of the name there  s a tall building there a 9 story and from the balcony there people saw that butchery when the poor soldier wear only helmet with shield and those unfortunate club move against that mob and when they fell those 12 to 14 year old boy ran up and use stone big heavy stone beat them to death on their head who could have guess that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government the upshot be that this republic have not be under soviet control for a long time but no one want to pay any attention or get involve if you be to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that i tell the truth be struggle for truth for five year there already the five year that i work at the azerbaijani railroad some people there consider me a demagogue others who know what some think an adventure seeker and some a prankster but i want everything to be right i would become outrage how can this be why be it people treat one another this way on a soviet railroad a though the azerbaijani railroad be azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some    mafia    if i want to i  ll get you out of here if i want to i  ll get rid of you if i want to i  ll do something else and there  s a black market price for everything in the most brazen way a coach to moscow cost so much a coach on a local train cost so much once when i be complain to the head of the conductor  s pool he have the nerve to tell me maybe you even believe this but this afraid i heard with my own ear    tatyana just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect alone against everyone so instead why you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you    i start to cry turn and left what else could i do where else could i go to complain i realize that everything be useless and the root of the whole thing be that it all go on and no one want to see it i file a write complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed it i still have a copy but what  s the use when the general procuracy get involve with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair in addition to the information about what i saw what i be a witness to i give testimony about the mafia at the railroad they accepted my petition but i know if go to pursue it or not because excuse me i no longer believe in the thing i aspire to the thing i believe in before all dead they just spit on my soul stomp on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belonging nonsense that all come with time but when your soul be spit upon and when the best in you    your belief    be destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them     i want to tell of one incident i just know at the time i be in such a state that i even take minor thing into account here be an example of course not a minor one my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she have a son valery who be in the 9th grade in a school in microdistrict 8  a boy vitaly danielian i know his last name go to school with him or rather go to school with him i be just sit in an apartment try to make a phone call to moscow oh yes and there  s one important detail when the massacre begin for two to three hour the phone work in armenian apartment and later in several russian and azerbaijani apartment but the fact of the matter be that service be shut off you could not call anywhere why again it mean it be all plan how come service be cut off for no reason and the light go off and those brat be rag a they like they afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap their hand and no one would dare to stop them they knew it now go to tell about the incident so this little vitaly vitalik an armenian boy go to school with valery they be in the same class accord to what valery and his neighbor pal say    at the time i be in the same apartment a they be i sat at the phone wait for the call to be put through    a mob attack the building where vitalik live so valery ran to his mother and say    mamma please let me go to vitalik  s what if they kill him maybe still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow a nice guy we all like him a good person smart    his mother let him go in tear she say    valery you go because i be afraid    he say    mamma we can get around the crowd just watch just have a look    they make it through i know i think vitalik s parent live in microdistrict no 1 and when they get there they make a superficial deduction know that balcony and door be be broken everywhere that you could see from the street which be the armenian apartment in the building they go here and there and look and saw that the window be intact and so they calm down but even though the window in that apartment be not broken everything inside be totally smash and vitalik lay there with a broken skull and his mother and father have already be murder little vitalik even know they be dead so two week ago i know he be in critical condition no maybe it be longer we left sumgait on march 20 spent some time in moscow and then we come to yerevan so be about a month already so hard to keep all this straight so valery the next day when he found out that vitalik  s family have be kill and vitalik be ling in the semashko hospital in baku valery and his classmate get together and go to visit him but they admit them tell them that he be in critical condition and that he be still in a coma they cry and left have also found out that the girl i saw be kick and drag be in that hospital too a it turn out she be brought there in serious condition but at least she be alive at the time when we get to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourselves into their arm and kiss them because you have wonder if these friend be alive or not if those friend be alive or not and when you saw them you be so glad to find out that the family have live when you saw people you heard thing that make your hair stand on end if you publish everything that happen it will be a hideous book a book of thing it be even difficult to believe and those two girl who be rap be entirely black and blue the one at the sk they know not lie that girlfriend come up to one of them and say    what happen    and she bar her breast and they be completely cover in cigarette burn those rogue have put cigarette out on her breast after something like that i know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it now when we stayed at the military unit for a while they provide well basic condition for u there the military unit be locate in nasosny some six mile from sumgait and living there we met with a large group of people there be about 1 600 people at the unit you know there be a point when i even go outside because if you go outside you saw so much heartbreak around you and when you hear the false rumor yes by the way false rumor be spread in sumgait say that the armenian around yerevan have destroyed azerbaijani village and raze them to the ground with bulldozer i know whether to believe it or not and people who know any well get the idea that it be all do in revenge but when i arrive in armenia and be in spitak and in spitak all those village be not only intact but at that time have even be protect just in case they be guard they get well food than do the inhabitant of spitak not a single person there die and no one be planning to harm them around yerevan all the village be safe and unharmed and the armenian attack anyone but actually after an evil of the magnitude suffer in sumgait there could have be a feel of vengefulness but no one act on it and i know why you sometimes hear accusation to the effect that the armenian be guilty that it be they who organize it rumor like that be be spread in azerbaijan and if one old person say it and ten young one hear it they not only perceive it with their mind but with their heart too to them it seem that the old person be tell the truth for example one say    do you know that out of 31 people kill by the way originally they say 31 people but later they found a 32nd 30 be azerbaijani and one be an armenian    of course upset but utterly impossible to discus such thing and not become upset sometimes l forget thing but i know i want to return to the time when we be in the sk club across from the city party committee when i saw muslimzade in the sk club building i go to him to ask because i believe that he have march in the front carry a banner i already mention this and if i repeat anything please excuse me i ask him    why do you do that and why be you here now why do you come here to laugh at these woman who be strewn about on the floor    the overcrowd there be tremendous it be completely unsanitary and several of the child be already sick true the troop try to make it livable for u they cooked for u on their field stove and provide u with wonderful food but the thing be that their main job be to ferret out the gang that be still at it everywhere that be continue it sordid affair everywhere plus they be never give any direct order they know what they be authorize to do and not to do and it be only on march 8 at five o clock in the even that krayev himself the lieutenant general the city commandant of sumgait be give full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he want to do a his heart advise him and relocate people to the military unit but not what i want to talk about now muslimzade characteristically try to get me out of the sk building and take me to the city party committee which be across the square from the club he take me by the hand and say    citizen worry go and have a talk in my office i told him    no after everything do i believe one iota of what you say if i go to the city party committee i  ll disappear and the trace of me will disappear too because you stand it when    oh yes and there be another interest detail from that meeting it be even very funny although at the time i up to laugh he be in a nice expensive hat and so a to put him to shame so to speak i say    oh why do you come here all duded up like a london dandy you smell of good perfume in your starch shirt and you have your expensive hat on you come to ridicule the poor woman and child who be lie on the floor who be already get sick whose relative have die do you come to laugh at them    and the one who be accompany him an azerbaijani i know who he be or what his title be he quickly snatch the hat off muslimzade  s head and hid it then i say    my god not marauder not you we come to you with the intention of steal       well kill me kill me    muslimzade say to me    but not guilty kill me kill me but not guilty    and i say    ok fine not guilty have it your way but give u an answer ask you where be you when they be torture and rap those poor woman when they be kill the child burning thing carry on outrageously and wreck all those apartment where be you then       you know we expect it we do not know what to do we anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait    i start laugh and say    truly funny    he say    what could i do we know what to do    and i say    sorry but it  ll be ridiculous if i tell you the first secretary of the city party committee march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body what you should have do the way it be during the war not a single party committee secretary compromise himself either he die or he lead people into battle and what do you do you ran away you left you hid you march with a flag because you be afraid excuse my language you fear for your own damn hide and when we ask you you tell u that you get confuse and you ask me what you could have do right    i told him    the city party committee get confuse all the party committee get confuse the police get confuse baku get confuse they all lay in a faint for two week and the gang ran the show with impunity and if it for the troop it have be just two day there be a single armenian left in sumgait for sure they would have finish their bloody affair because they brazenly go up to some russian too the one who try to say something to them and they told them  as soon a we finish with the armenian come after you too    and by the way there be a colonel who take u to the military unit he be the one with the light blue collar tab who flew in and two hour later arrive on an armored personnel carrier when we be at the sk and take u to the military unit and who later start move u from the military unit we ask him    what how what will come of u    he openly say    you know for u the main thing now be to catch that gang finish that quickly stay at the military unit for the time be and decide later    the general procuracy of the ussr arrive it consists of investigator from all city there be some from stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair be truly frightful about this by the way comrade katusev spoke a everyone know the first deputy general procurator of the ussr when he give u a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he told u the honest truth because he not say it because he be still experience his first impression of what he have see and he say    there be afghanistan and it be bad but sumgait    horrible and the people who dare to do such a thing will be severely punish in accordance with our law    and a quote then one mother throw herself at him    her two son have die before her very eye    and say    who will return my son who be go to punish the culprit    they try to calm her down and he say    in order for u to conduct a proper investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help u because we know maybe there be someone else in the gang who be now be conceal in home and maybe the neighbor know maybe someone saw something be afraid write about it in detail so that not afraid everyone know that many of you be afraid have live through such horror they think that if they write the whole truth about let  s say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later go to do it like this go to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there we need to know who write it the name of the people who write be make public but we need all the information let each and every one not be afraid let each write what be necessary who they saw in that gang who make threat or shout threaten gibe about the armenian you must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn    two soldier and a major guard the urn and sure enough many people people who even want to write  i know one woman who ask me she come up and say    you a a russian the same thing happen to you a will happen to me so please i  ll give you the information and you please write it down for me    so she be afraid and there be a lot like her but later after katusev make his speech she sat and write down everything she knew and we threw it all into the urn now we know if it will be of any use for a factual picture will emerge from all that information one person can lie but thousand lie thousand simply lie you have to agree with that a fact be a fact why for example should someone say that black be white if it be really black the first deputy chairman of the council of minister of the azerbaijani ssr mamedov a i say be in yerevan my husband and i be at the council of minister of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov be present the one who have come to convince the people of sumgait to return to their previous dwelling to their old apartment we ask for a meeting with him and it be grant when we go to see him he try to behave properly very politely delicately but when the truth be told right to his face and when i ask him some of the same question i have ask muslimzade    where be you personally when they be beating u now try to convince u to return why you think at the time that they be slaughter u where it be all lead    he say    tell the truth let  s not mince word told me right to my face and i  ll tell you straight i  ll tell you the pure truth i be gotten out of bed in the even the whole government be up include me and we be restrain a crowd of about 45 000 in baku but we never expect that in a city like sumgait with it fine international record such a thing could happen we expect it in baku    i say    so that mean you expect it all the same why be you expect it    and he say    you know it just happen that way we be expect it in baku we be try to restrain it but in sumgait    i say    fine you know for the first three or four hour but then you should have know why do no one help u    and he say    well ok we know what to do    and thing like that basically it be the same story i get from muslimzade later when he say    you go on back the situation in sumgait be favorable now everything be fine the armenian be friendly with the azerbaijani    to this l answer    you know what speak with you a a member of a neutral nation i have never argue with armenian or with azerbaijani and i be an eyewitness you tell me please comrade mamedov    i ask him    what would you say about this honestly if you be be completely frank with u    then he say    yes i admit that i be honestly ashamed shame on the entire azerbaijani nation we have disgrace ourselves not only before the entire soviet union but before the whole world because now the voice of america and all the other foreign radio station of various hue be branding u with all kind of rumor too    and i say    there  s nothing to add to what really happen i think possible to add anything more awful    he say    yes i agree with you i understand your pain it be truly an unfortunate occurrence    i repeat that he say    unfortunate occurrence    and then he suddenly remember himself what he be say    he have a pen in his hand he be fidget with it nervously    and say    oh excuse me a tragedy really    i take this to mean that he really think an    unfortunate occurrence       and of course    he say    i understand that have go through all this you return to sumgait but necessary to cool down and realize that all those people be be try    and he even give a detail which i know if it matter or not that 160 policeman be be try specifically in relation to that bloody affair yes by the way there be another good detail how i be set up at work in baku after the event i go to an undergarment plant there be an azerbaijani work there and suddenly she tell me    what they nail your husband they screw up    i be floor i imagine that anyone in baku too could say something like that well after that i go up to see to my office i need to find out about those day what be go to happen with them how they be go to put down those day from february 29 to march 10 and the administrator told me    i know tatyana go to the head of the conductor pool be grateful if they put it down a unexcused absence    i be really discourage by this they all know that we be but a hair away from death and barely survive and here tell me that i be skip work a though i be off enjoy myself somewhere i go to the office of the chief of the pool his last name be rasulov and have that position for many year incidentally a party member and be a big man in town and suddenly when i go to him and say    comrade rasulov this be the way it be    he look at me askance and say    and why be you       he know me by my previous last name       why do you get wrap up in this mess    i say    what do you mean why do i get wrap up in this mess my husband  s an armenian    i tell him    i have an armenian last name    and he screw up his face make a kind of a grimace a though he have eat something sour and say    i expect that you would    what do he mean by that and    how    should he behave the chief of the pool a man who supervises 1 700 worker now true there be a reduction but for sure there be still 1 200 conductor work for him and if someone who supervises a staff that size say thing like that then what can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person go to believe any and all rumor that the armenian be like this the armenian be like that and so on by the way that mamedov    now go back to mamedov  s office when i ask him    be you really go to guarantee the safety of our life if we return to sumgait    he answer    yes you know i would guarantee them i want to take on too much i would guarantee them firmly for 50 year but i guarantee them for longer than 50 year    i say    so get another thing like that plan for 50 year from now so be quiet and then in another 50 year it  ll happen again    i contain myself any more and i also told him    and how do it get to that point certainly you knew about it how they be treat the russian for example in baku and in sumgait how they be hound from their job certainly you receive complaint i write some myself why do no one respond to them why do everyone ignore what be go on you prepare people for this by the way you treat them    and he say    you know finally start to insult me    he threw his pen on the desk    maybe now say a scoundrel too    i say    you know not talk about you because i know but about the one who i do know i can say with conviction yes that comrade be involve in this that and that because i know for certain    well anyway he assure u that here in yerevan there be false rumor that 3 000 sumgait armenian be here and 15 000 be in sumgait and have gotten back to work everyone be work he say and life be very good    we drove about the town ourselves comrade arutiunian first secretary of the communist party of armenia ssr come from the council of minister of armenian he come and brought information show that everything be fine in sumgait    when i ask mamedov how he have reach that conclusion he say    well i walk down the street    and i say    walk down the street in any city even if i be to go to new york i would never understand the situation because i would be a guest i have any contact with people but if you spend 10 day among some blue collar worker in such a way that they know you be the first deputy chairman of the council of minister hear something quite different    i told him for example that i drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartment they take u all in turn to pick thing up since people have flee to the military unit they get on the bus just to save themselves a soon a possible how be the neighbor in the microdistrict how will they view u what do they think i thought maybe that in fact it something general of a mass nature some anti national something and when that bus take u to our building because it be the same bus while we be go up to our apartment an arm soldier accompany u what do that say it speaks of the fact that if everything there be fine why do we need to have soldier go there and come back with u go from apartment to apartment and in fact especially with the young people you could sense the delight at our misfortune the grin and they be make comment too and that be in the presence of troop when police detachment be in the microdistricts and armored personnel carrier and tank be passing by and if people be take such malicious delight when the situation be like that then what be it go to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether there will be more outrage of course perhaps not organize but in the alley april 20 1988 yerevan reference 1 _the sumgait tragedy pogrom against

 be you try to say that there be no massacre in deir yassin or in sabra and shatila if so then let me tell you some good joke there be not and be not any such thing like jewish kill in wwii palestinian just do what davidians do for fourty year and more in fact no one be kill in any war at any time or any place people die that be all no one get kill maybe also vietamiese die in vietnam war kill by american napalm they be just pyromaniac and all maybe jew just like gas chamber and no one force them to get in there they may be thought it be like snifing cocaine no what do you think of this it stupid to say so well it be a stupid a what you say  next time you want to lie do it intelligently sincerely yours hassan arab civilian do die at dir yassin but there be no massacre first of all the village house many  armed  troop secondly the irgun and stern fighter have absolutely no intention of kill civilian the village be attack only for it military significance in fact a warn be give to the occupant of the village to leave before the attack be to begin by all rational standard dir yassin be not a massacre the kill be unintentional the village house arab sniper and arab troop thus it be attack for it military significance it be not attack with intention of kill any civilian to even compare dir yassin in which some 120 or so arab die to the holocaust be absurd the irgun do not want to kill any civilian the village have almost 1000 inhabitant most of whom survive
 pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for plant the bomb which kill the three idf troop and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them several village be shell how could the idf possibly have know that there be guerrilla in each of the targetted village you see it be an arbitrary act of    retaliation    the problem tim be that the original reason for the invasion be palestinian attack on israel not lebanese attack first i believe that my statement applies to both side have say that i think it be neccessary to separate what be legitimately negotiable and what be not for example no country have the right to abuse one  s human right decide whether there will be one or two state in palestine be a legitimate question while de facto one state exists israel must treat all within it domain equitably yes i be afraid that what you say be true but that still do not justify occupy your neighbor  s land israel must resolve it dispute with the native palestinian if it want peace from such attack not true lebanese be not attack israel in the 1970s with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrol the palestinian heavy weapon have be siezed in past year and i do not see a significant a threat a once exist

 i thought the implication be that the prince destroyed one fourth of the remain persian troop on the second round and then 1 11 of those remain on the third round this would mean
 from _quantum_ magazine march april 1993 page 42 46 the problem book of anania of shirak                                                          on the ancient peak of ararat the century have come like second and pass on     avetik issahakian by yuri danilov some year ago journalist interview celebrity like to ask them    what book would you take with you if you be to go off on a space flight    and though the number of book allow on the trip varied from 10 to 30 depend on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer and celebrity be people of the most varied taste age and profession not one of them dare to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problem some of these people certainly exclude this kind of literature because they be train in the humanity and have nothing but scorn for    number    though secretly afraid of them others steer clear of such puzzle book because they be master of incomparably more difficult branch of modern mathematics and mind say for all the world to hear that they know how to solve mere arithmetic problem professional mathematician be no exception here  s what the russian mathematician alexander khinchin a specialist in statistic write about arithmetic    i willingly confess that any time a fifth grader ask me to help solve an arithmetic problem it be a hard work for me and sometimes i fail completely of course like most of my friend i could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route    construct equation or set of equation but we be suppose to avoid use algebraic analysis at all cost by the way a fact that be well know and oft repeat that a a rule neither high school graduate nor student at teach college nor teacher begin their career nor i must add scientific researcher can solve arithmetic problem it seem the only people in the world who be able to solve them be fifth grade teacher    now not insist that a book of arithmetic problem be include in the bookbag of anyone fly into space but a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the moon but for a extend space voyage    say to venus and back one for the    road    they both take out the book they brought for the road kingsley glance at the royal astronomer  s book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroat shoot at each other with revolver    god know what this kind of stuff lead to    thought kingsley the royal astronomer look at kingsley  s book and saw the history of herodotus    good lord next be reading thucydides    thought the royal astronomer    fred hoyle the black cloud the book talk about very big but it 24 problem constitute 24 elegant miniature from seventh century armenia naive and wise at the same time rich in strike detail and the bright coloration of the period these problem be reminiscent of the relief on the famous monument of armenian architecture the church on the island of akhtamar in lake van in what be now turkey_ they be a inseparable from the image of armenia a the elegant letter of the armenian alphabet invent by mesrop mashtots or the song of komitas or the painting of saryan an edition of these incredibly beautiful problem have long be a bibliographic rarity it be publish under the title problem and solution of vardapet 1 anania of shirak armenian mathematician of the seventh century translate and publish by i  a  orbeli petrograd 1918 the abundance of close observation and wide ranging information about the way of life and custom of that remote epoch when anania of shirak live and work have actually render a disservice to his problem book for many year the book be know only to researcher in the humanity    specialist in armenian history who jealously guard their treasure and let just anyone see it even now after research by k  p  patkanov the learn monk father kaloust j i orbeli a  abramyan v  k  chaloyan and others have brought the work of anania of shirak to light in scholarly circle the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book vardapet anania of shirak once fell in love with the art of calculation i thought that no philosophical notion can be construct without number consider it the mother of all wisdom    anania of shirak among ancient armenian thinker vardapet anania of shirak stand out because of the breadth of his interest and the unique mathematical orientation of his work some of his work have be preserve in addition to the problem and solution the follow tract have found a special place in the estimation of scholar on weight and measure cosmography and calendrical theory and armenian geography of the seventh century a d  the authorship of the last work be long attribute to another outstanding thinker of ancient armenia movses of khoren in his autobiography anania of shirak have this to say about himself i anania of shirak have study all the science of our armenian land and have learn the holy scripture intimately in the expression of the psalmist    every day i illuminate the eye of my mind    feel myself lack in the art of calculation i come to the conclusion that it be fruitless to study philosophy the mother of all science without number i could find in armenia neither a man verse in philosophy nor book that explain the science i therefore go to greece and met in theodosiople a man name iliazar who be well verse in ecclesiastical work he told me that in forth armenia 2 there live a famous mathematician christosatur i go this person and spent six month with him but soon i notice that christosatur be a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary fact i then go to constantinople where i met acquaintance who told me    why do you go so far when much closer to u in trebizon on the coast of pontus 3 life the byzantine vardapet tyukhik he be full of wisdom be know to king and know armenian literature    i ask them how they knew this they answer    we saw ourselves that many people travel long distance to become pupil of so learn a man indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of constantinople philagrus travel with u bring many young person to become pupil of tyukhik    when i heard this i express my gratitude to god who have quenched the thirst of his slave i go to tyukhik at the monastery of st  eugene and explain why i he sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of st  gregory i be glad that all your country will learn from me i myself live in armenia for many year a a youth ignorance reign there    vardapet tyukhik love me a a son and share all his thought with me the lord bestow upon me his blessing i completely assimilate the science of number and with such success that my fellow student at the king  s court begin to envy me i spent eight year with tyukhik and study many book that have not be translate into our language for the vardapet have an innumerable collection of book secret and explicit ecclesiastical and pagan book on art history and medicine book of chronology why enumerate them by title in a word there be no book that tyukhik do not have and he have such a gift from the holy spirit for translate that when he sat down to translate something from the greek into armenian he do not struggle a other translator do and the translation read a if the work be write in that language originally tyukhik told me how he have achieve such vast erudition and how he have learn the armenian language    when i be young    he say    i live in trebizon at the court of the military chief ioannus patricus and for a long time up to the accession of mauritius to the throne i serve a a military man in armenia and learn your language and literature during one attack by persian troop on the greek i be wound and escape to antioch i lose all my possession pray to the lord to heal my wound i make a promise    if you prolong my life i shall dedicate it not to accumulate perishable treasure but to collect treasure of knowledge    and the lord heard my prayer after i recover i go to jerusalem and from there to alexandria and rome upon return to constantinople i met a famous philosopher from athens and study with him for many year after that i return to my homeland and begin to teach and instruct my people    after some year that philosopher die not find a replacement for him the king and his courtier sent for tyukhik and invite him to assume the teacher  s position tyukhik cite the promise he make to god not to move far from the city turn down the offer but because of his wide lean people come stream from all country to study with him and i the most insignificant of all armenian have learn from him this powerful science desire by king brought it to our country support by no one obligate only to my own industry god  s help and the prayer of the bless educator and no one thanked me for my effort problem and solution a half and one sixth and one nine ninth of all the book be print on verge one fifth and one two hundred eighty fifth    on rag paper one forty fifth and one eight hundred fifty fifth    on vellum and forty five inscribed copy    on dutch paper and so find how many copy be print in all    imitation of anania of shirak a latin proverb say habent sua fata libelli    book have their own fate    the fate of problem and solution by anania of shirak be quite amaze the manuscript of anania  s book be preserve only because accord to armenian historian    in ancient and medieval armenia manuscript be guard from invader like weapon and cherished like one  s own child    biding their time the manuscript lay in the matenadaran a renowned depository of ancient manuscript now the mesrop mashtots institute of ancient manuscript and it hour finally arrive in 1896 the learn monk father kaloust use two manuscript to publish the problem book supplement it with an introduction and commentary in 1918 the book be translate into russian edit annotate and typeset by iosef orbeli a prominent scholar and later a member of the academy of science of the ussr in the translator  s word the problem of anania be    amuse full of life and simple    orbeli go on to say    the subject of the problem be generally take from everyday life the scene be predominantly his homeland shirak and the surround countryside and the dramatis persona if they be name be the local prince    the kamsarakans include nersekh who be a contemporary of anania    like other ancient author anania of shirak use only    aliquot       that be fraction with a numerator of 1  when it be necessary to write fraction with numerator other than 1 one have to represent it a a sum of aliquot see the epigraph above like any true work of art the problem of anania suffer terribly in the retell you have to read the original albeit in translation in their full glory so let  s open anania  s problem book    a gift from across the age problem 1 and 8 relate to the armenian uprise against the persian in a d  572  problem 1 my father told me the follow story during the famous war between the armenian and the persian prince zaurak kamsarakan perform extraordinary heroic deed three time in a single month he attack the persian troop the first time he struck down half of the persian army the second time pursue the persian he slaughter one fourth of the soldier the third time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army the persian who be still alive number two hundred eighty flee to nakhichevan and so from this remainder find how many persian soldier there be before the massacre problem 8 during the famous armenian uprise against the persian when zaurak kamsarakan kill suren one of the armenian azats 4 sent an envoy to the persian king to report the baleful news the envoy cover fifty mile in a day fifteen day later when he learn of this zaurak kamsarakan sent rider in pursuit to bring the envoy back the rider cover eighty mile in a day and so find how many day it take them to catch the envoy problem 18 mention vessel make of vary amount of metal in the russian translation they be all call    dish    but in the original armenian accord to orbeli  s note the dish in the first and second instance be call mesur and in the third instance scutel scutel be a common armenian word but mesur have not be encounter in armenian literature before anania  s problem and solution problem 18 there be a tray in my house i melt it down and make other vessel from the metal from one third i make a mesur from one fourth another mesur from one fifth two goblet from one sixth two scutels and from two hundred ten dram i make a bowl and now find the weight of the tray several of the problem reflect the richness of the caucasian fauna in anania  s time    for instance problem 7  problem 7 once i be in marmet the capital of the kamsarakans stroll along the bank of the river akhuryan i saw a school of fish and order that a net be cast we caught a half and a quarter of the school and all the fish that slip out of the net end up in a creel when i look in the creel i found forty five fish and now find how many fish here be in all the temptation be great to present all 24 problem but i  ll restrain myself and offer you just one more problem 20 provide some interest information about the wild animal that inhabit armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there be no mention of them even in zoological reference book the wild donkey accord to the generally accepted view never roam the armenian land yet anania of shirak offer evidence to the contrary problem 20 the hunt preserve of nersekh kamsarakan ter 5 of shirak and asharunik be at the base of the mountain call artin one night great herd of wild donkey enter the preserve the hunter could not cope with the donkey and run to the village of talin told nersekh about them when he arrive with his brother and azats and enter the preserve they begin kill the wild beast half of the animal be caught in trap one fourth be kill by arrow the young which constitute one twelfth of all the animal be caught alive and three hundred sixty wild donkey be kill by spear and so find how many beast there be at the start of this massacre    set in type by me iosef orbeli    his biography could not be squeeze into the framework of a bibliography    k uzbashyan academician iosef abgarovich orbeli anyone who be lucky enough to hold a copy 1 n of the small printing    n be the solution to the epigraph in the previous section of the russian translation of anania of shirak  s problem and solution a thin book with yellowed page have probably notice the variety of the font the elegance of the border and the high quality of the design printing and binding such great attention to detail be characteristic of work that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking and this problem book be indeed a kind of diploma attest to the professional maturity of the man who create it an advertisement at the end of the book read    this book be typeset in december 1917 at the printing office of the russian academy of science by me iosef orbeli the text be also proofread laid out and decorate with border by me various circumstance prevent me from carry this project to the end the final page of the book be typeset by m strolman    typeset be neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist iosef orbeli who later become the director of the hermitage museum in leningrad he be also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith orbeli have already become acquaint with the famous academic printing house typis academiae found in 1728 and know all over the scientific world for it rich collection of font and it virtuoso typesetter in prepare to publish the corpus of ancient inscription preserve on the wall of armenian church orbeli

 there have be a number of article on the pb frontline program about iranian bomb here be my 0 02 on this and related subject one be curious to know the real reason behind this and related public relation campaign about iran in recent month these include 1 attempt to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade center despite great effort in this direction they have not succeed in this they however have indirectly create the impression that iran be behind the rise of fundamentalist islamic movement and thus be indirectly implicate in this matter 2 public statement by the secretary of state christoffer and other official source regard iran be a terrorist and outlaw state 3 and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program i suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and perhaps intensify why this increase pressure on iran a number of factor may have be behind this these include 1 the rise of islamic movement in north africa and radical hamas movement in the israeli occupy territory this movement be basically anti western and be not necessarily fuel by iran the cause for accelerate pace of this movement be probably the gulf war which sought to return colonial shieks and amir to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom also the obvious support of algerian military coup against the democratically elect algerian islamic front which clearly expose the democracy myth a far cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of bosnian moslem 2 possible future implication of this movement in saudi arabia and other u client state and endangerment of the cheap oil source from this region 3 a need to create an enemy a an excuse for huge defense expenditure this have become necessary after the demise of soveit union the recent pr campaign against iran however seem to be direct from israel rather than washington there be no fundamental conflict of interest between iran and the u and in my opinion it be in the interest of both country to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relation this may have a moderate effect on the rise of radical movement within the islamic world and iran
 and lebanon have a right to make this decision without syrian troop control the country until syria leaf and free election take place it be rediculous to claim that the lebanese would even be involve in determine what happens to their country i expect you will agree that the same hold true for syria have no right to be in lebanon the un also thought zionism be racism that fails to make it true they last week against tank in  48 and stop those tank from advance they also last day in  73 there be little evidence for the claim that they be military liability they evidence be there to show that when infiltration take place over the jordan river the existance of large patrol kibutzim force terrorist into a very small area where they be usually picked up in the morning nonsense israel have be try to get it neighbor to the negotiate table for 40 year it be the gulf war that brought the arab to the table not the israeli nonsense accord to arafat israel must be destroyed he have never come clean and deny that this be his plan he always waffle on what he mean    when the arab set off their volcano there will only be arab in this part of the world our people will continue to fuel the torch of the revolution with river of blood until the whole of the occupy homeland be liberate           yasser arafat ap 3 12 79 adam shostack adam das harvard edu
 yes victim exist there be a stagger number of victim in the world and more each day i think on balance intervention would create more victim include american one since the first responsibility of the u government be to protect american i think they serve that role best by stay away from bosnia and other regional conflict of course not the jew be not try to carve a territory out of germany either and except for small scale resistance and a few large uprising do not have an army or a government i see the pattern of atrocity a a fairly often practice tactic of a colonize power drive away and or eliminate the population of an area they want to control the u try basically that in vietnam the iraqi in kuwait the israeli in palestine south africa etc etc etc it suck ugly and sadden but it be not genocide it be not my impression that the serb want to eliminate every muslim in yugoslavia i still say the bosnians be get their ass kick they should surrender and evacuate the area they hold i be a staunch republican btw the irony of argue against military intervention with argument base on vietnam have not escape me i be oppose to u intervention in somalia for the same reason although clearly it be not nearly a risky well one thing you have to remember be the press like a good story good for business you know and btw not    everyone    want to help the side that be less like u i never say the two side be morally equivalent i say neither one be innocent there be just too many good reason to stay away 1 the european be perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their border in any way we do it put another way we have no assistance to offer the european which they do not already posse themselves it be not good to promote the idea in anyone  s mind that the united state be responsible for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world 2 clinton be not the man to lead this country into a military adventure full stop
 just an interrupt comment here since early 1980  s israeli say they be willing to give up the adminstration rule of the occupy terretories to palestineans palestineans refuse and will refuse such settlement that denies them their right of self determination period ok  i donot know why there be israeli voice against negotiation however i would guess that be because they refuse give back a land for those who have the right for it a for the arabian and palestinean voice that be against the current negotiation and the so called peace process they be not against peace per se but rather for their well founded prediction that israel would not give an inch of the west bank and most probably the same for golan height back to the arab an 18 month of    negotiation    in madrid and washington prove these prediction now many will jump on me say why be you blame israeli for no result negotiation i would say why would the arab stall the negotiation what do they have to loose arab feel that the current    negotiation    be only for legitimize the current status quo and for opening the door of the arab market for israeli trade and    orange    that be simply unacceptable and would be revoke just an opinion

officer karagodaviev today some turk be murder on the street on february 12 some armenian have shot more than ten innocent moslem the russian soldier who attempt to save these people be threaten with

annihilate on the same day when antranik enter erzurum i report the massacre to him and ask him to track down the perpetrator of this horrible act however no result be achieve in the village whose inhabitant have be massacre there be a natural silence on the night of 26 27 february the armenian deceive the russian perpetrate a massacre and escape for fear of the turkish soldier later it be understood that this massacre have be base upon a method organize and plan in a circular the population have be herd in a certain place and then kill one by one the number of murder commit on that night reach three thousand it be the armenian who brag to about the detail of the massacre the armenian fight against the turkish soldier be so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldier who consist of only five hundred people and two cannon for one night and ran away the lead armenian of the community could have prevent this massacre however the armenian intellectual have share the same idea with the renegade in this massacre just a in all the others the low class within the armenian community have always obeyed the order of the lead armenian figure and commander i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectual be accessory to these murder no for there be people who oppose the armenian for such action since they understood that it would yield no result however such people be only a minority furthermore such people be consider a traitor to the armenian cause some have seemingly oppose the armenian murder but have support the

 it be very encourage that a number of people take so interest in my posting i recieved a couple of letter too some have debate the statement that event in bosnia be unprecedented in the history of the modern world those who contest this statement present the figure of the world war ii however we must keep in mind that it be a world war and no country have the power to stop it today be the matter not of the power but of the will it seem to be that what we lack be the will second point of difference which make it different from the holocast sp be that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event today inspite of all the might the international community be not just stand neutral but have place an arm embargo which be to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally mankind have side with the killers and this i think be unprecedented in the history of the modern world

 well if you put thing into historical perspective the turk move into an area which be inhabit by greek this be how the history between the two nation start some century ago since then it have be a continuous battle between the two nation from my perspective i see why i should say that greek have be responsible for what have happen between the two nation of course it would not be reasonable to argue that the hostility should drag till we kick the turk out of this area this go to happen so the best would be to improve the relation between the two country a golden oportunity exists with cyprus if thing work there there any possible way that could work between our nation i always avoid to discus such thing i consider it a waist of my time besides a i say i do not want to open a new flame i thought it be a smart move to receive more money from greek tourist i bet that this week there should be about 200 000 tourist from greece in turkey each one will leave at least 1 000 so go and figure what this mean to your economy if you have kept the visa requirement how many greek would bother to visit turkey come on do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience you err if you think get a reasonable conclusion

 first let me correct myself in that it be goerbels and not goering airforce who ran the nazi propaganda machine i agree that arab news source be also inherently bias but i believe the statement i be react to be that since the american account of event be not fully like the israeli account the american be bias i just thought that the israeli have more motivation for bias the un have try many time to condemn israel for it gross violation of human right however the u have vetoed most such attempt it be interest to note that the u s  be often the only country oppose such condemnation well the u s  and israel it be also interest to note that that mean other western country realize these human right violation so maybe there be human right violation go on after all

 true but maybe not the bad possible see algeria this be true and i may add the adjective    stupid    until the intifada since then no serious israeli leader include shamir really think the the occupy territory worth the trouble the only question become the question of price and other quantitative detail the best thing the palestinian can do for themselves these day be to stop the intifada and try to live a normally a possible i know hard under occupation otherwise people might think that five year of stone throw a justified a it may be have cause the palestinian an irreversible damage that prevents them from run a normal state when the time come currently it serf no purpose and just a waste of human life and economic resource
 amir y rosenblatt writes sam zbib writes no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity palestinian be no exception perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business world since we be debate the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the law govern the guideline and ethic of such transaction basic anti trust law say that while you can purchase ibm stock for the purpose of invest you can not acquire a large number of those share with the intent or control ibm you can do so only if you make your intention clear apriori clearly the jew who purchase property from palastenians have some design they be not buying a dwell or a real estate they be establish a bridgehead for the european jew the palastenians sell their property to the jew in the old tradition of arab hospitality be a multi ethnic multi religious society accept the jew a neighbour be no different just another religion plus they paid fair market value etc     they do not know they be victim of an international conspiracy not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one be hard to dismiss amir why would you categorize the sale of land a shaft be it because it be sell to jew be it fair to assume that the fallahin would be mistreat by the jew be this the norm of any commerce read shaft between arab and jew your claim that the lebanese syrian landlord sell palestine if true even partially omits the fact that the mandate treaty put lebanon and syria under french rule while palestine under british obiviously any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in palestine and would be motivate to sell regardless of the price it be interest though that you acknowledge that the palestinian be shaft do many israeli or jew share your opinion do you absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitment just because it write down all told i do not see an answer in your response the question be whether the intent behind the purchase be aim at control the public asset land infra structure etc     imho the palestinian have ground to contest the legality of the purchase say in world court sam

 the hamas way of death follow be a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape make last summer by the qassam battalion the military arm of hamas an islamic palestinian group hamas figure significantly in the middle east equation in december israel deport more than 400 palestinian to lebanon in response to hamas  s kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier a longer version appear in the may issue of harper  s magazine which obtain and translate the tape my name be yasir hammad al hassan ali i live in nuseirat a refugee camp in the gaza strip i be born in 1964  i finish high school then attend gaza polytechnic later i go to work for islamic university in gaza a a clerk married and i have two daughter the qassam battalion be the only group in palestine explicitly dedicate to jihad holy war our primary concern be palestinian who collaborate with the enemy many young men and woman have fall prey to the cunning trap laid by the israeli security service since our enemy be try to obliterate our nation cooperation with them be clearly a terrible crime our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration to do so we abduct collaborator intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborator and expose the method that the enemy us to lure palestinian into collaboration in the first place in addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborator by execute them we execute every collaborator after all about 70 percent of them be innocent victim tricked or black mailed into their misdeed the decision whether to execute a collaborator be base on the seriousness of his crime if like many collaborator he have be recruit a an agent of the israeli border guard then it be imperative that he be execute at once a dangerous a an israeli soldier so we treat him like an israeli soldier there  s another group of collaborator who perform an even more loathsome role    the one who help the enemy trap young men and woman in blackmail scheme that force them to become collaborator i regard the    isqat    the process by which a palestinian be blackmail into collaboration of single person a great crime than the kill of a demonstrator if someone be guilty of cause repeat case of isqat than it be our religious duty to execute him a third group of collaborator be responsible for the distribution of narcotic they work on direct order from the security service to distribute drug a widely a possible their victim become addict and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more they collaborate in order to get the drug they crave the dealer must also be execute in the battalion we have developed a very careful method of uncover collaborator we afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person his reputation be tarnished forever we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt have be establish    never before if after interrogation the collaborator be found guilty beyond any doubt then he be execute in many case we have to make our evidence against collaborator public because everyone know that guilty but when the public aware that a certain individual be a collaborator and we accuse him people be bound to ask for evidence many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he be execute this proof be usually obtain in the form of a confession at first every collaborator denies his crime so we start off by show the collaborator the testimony against him we tell him that he still have a chance to serve his people even in the last moment of his life by confess and give u the information we need we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he have be a victim that kind of talk be convincing most of them confess after that others hold out in those case we apply pressure both psychological and physical then the holdout confess a well only one collaborator have ever be execute without an interrogation in that case the collaborator have be see work for the border guard since before the intifada and he himself confess his involvement to a friend who disclose the information to u in addition three member of his network of collaborator told u that he have cause their isqat with this much evidence there be no need to interrogate him but we be very careful to avoid wrongful execution in every case our principal be the same the accuse should be interrogate until he himself confesses his crime a few week ago we sat down and comply a list of collaborator to decide whether there be any who could be execute without interrogation an although we have hundred of name still because of our fear of god and of hell we could not mark any of these men except for the one i just mention for execution when we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we shoot him    to do so might give away our location why collaborator be

 proven maybe not but it can certainly be verify beyond a reasonable doubt this statement and statement like it be a matter of public record before the six day war 1967 i think nasser and some other arab leader be broadcasting these statement on arab radio you might want to check out some old newspaper ahmed i think if you take a look at the hamas covenant write in 1988 you might get a different impression i have the convenant in the original arabic with a translation that verify with arabic speaker the document be rife with call to kill jew and spread islam and so forth

 not acceptable syria and lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the french invasion where they be both part of the same    mandate territory    read colony israel have no right to determine what happens in lebanon invade another country because you consider them a threat be precisely the way that almost all war of aggression have start again territorial expansion by force the un defines them a occupy they be recognise a such by every nation on earth exclude one small caribean island so the adam think that peace be possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence that be a completely unsustainable situation because the usa be bankrupt and simply can not afford to finance the israeli ecconomy any more there be no money for such an occupation they be move in a part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupy territory machiavelli described the reason in the prince the clear intention be to create a constituency which the likud beleived could not be deprive of the land steal from the indigenous population the pretext under which the settler aquired land be through the redefinition of much land use in common a    public land    the assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual have title be clearly an excuse when the land be use to build a condominium for alien brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there be a clear breach of the geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupy territory must not be change no amount of self justify on the part of likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world government and all of those that actually have any power have condemn this practice theyu also be a liability we be talk about civilian encampment that would last no more than hour against tank fool yourself it be the gulf war that brought the israeli to the negotiate table once their u backer have a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else if the creation of settlement have go on any longer the usa would have cut the money supply not at all they can chose to live in an arab state or return to israel the existence of a comunity do not give the right for another country to annexe territory not in bosnia not in the west bank unless the new boundary drawn up be those of 48 there will be no peace araffat have precious little authority to agree to anything else the real issue be not the land treaty but the trade treaty since the palestinian will remain heavily dependent on israel indefinitely it be this that will be the guarantor of peace another factor will be the return of land confiscate by the israeli state within israel and the dismantle of the shadow structure which allow discrimination against non jew within what be nominaly a secular state the irony be that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state have a non descrimination law in order to protect the remain settler the israeli state be go to be force inot the same position this will mean outlaw of discrimination such a that which prevents arab from buying or use much of the land

 thank you brad ali for warn u about the danger of propaganda funny though come from you who be it that executes these    pin point attack    on israeli the guy in the white hat or the one in the black hat neither you mean that they be just civilian farmer teacher school child well maybe they be terrorist after all and maybe that    propaganda    be correct too hmm
    fete    since this word both formally and commonly refers to positive joyous event your misuse of it here be rather unsettle i certainly abhor those israeli policy and attitude that be abusive towards the palestinians gazans give that however there  is no comparison  between the reality of the warsaw ghetto and in gaza just a international law recognizes the right of the occupy entity to maintain order especially in the face of element that be consciously attempt to disrupt the civil structure ironically international law recognizes each of these focus that of the occupy and the occupier even though they be inherently in conflict israel certainly can not and should not continue it present policy towards gazan resident there be however a third alternative  the creation and implementation of a jewish    dhimmi    system with gazans palestinians a benignly    protect    citizen would you find that a acceptable in that form a you do with regard to islam  s policy towards it minority it be a race then between israel  s anti palestinian gazan    final solution    and the arab world  s anti israel jewish    final solution    do you favor one neither since there be justifiable worry by various party that israel and arab palestinian    final solution    intention exist it important that both israeli  and  palestinian gazan    right    be secure

 great interview with benjamin netanyahu on cnn larry king live 4 15 93 this guy be know what he be talk about he be truely charismatic articulate intelligent and demonstrates real leadership quality i agree but i wish i like his politics
 it be more appropriate to address netters with their name a they appear in their signature i fail to do so since you do not bother to sign your post not only because it be the polite thing to do but also to avoid address lady with    mr     a you have do secondly the island of which the name be more correctly spell a cyprus have never be greek but rather it have be home to a bi communal society form of greek and turk it seem that you know a little about the history and the demography of the island a you know about the essence of turkey  s military intervention to it under international agreement be that a it may an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what be go on today on azerbaijani land can only be drawn with the expansionist policy that armenia be now pursue but i could agree that it be not for u to issue diagnosis to the political conduct of country and promulgate them in such terminology a    itchy bitchy        onur yalcin

     henrik country turk and azeri consistantly want to drag armenia into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan bm gim me a break capital letter or not the above be pure nonsense it bm seem to me that short sight armenian be escalate the hostility                                        henrik again armenian in karabakh be simply defend themselves what do henrik want them to do lay down their arm and let azeri walk all over them news report see say otherwise both location and motif wise cap change fact bm while hop that turkey will stay out stop and think for a moment bm will you armenia need anyone to drag her into the conflict it bm be a part of it henrik armenian knew from the begining that turk be fully engage henrik training azeri militarily to fight against karabakhi armenians so should i at this point break into cap and start talk about defense etc  i know how  fully engage turkey is was though henrik the karabakhi armenians who have live in their homeland for 3000 henrik year cut off from armenia and give to azeri by stalin be the henrik one directly involve in the conflict they be defend henrik themselves against azeri aggression bm huh you expect azeri  s to be friendly to force fight with them bm within their border henrik well history be sad remember those be relocate azeri into henrik the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime so i hear this justifies bloodshed n year after the fact henrik at last i hope that the u s  insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik occur again bm not play with a full deck be you where would turkey invade henrik it be not up to me to speculate but i be sure turkey would have step henrik into armenia if she could why would turkey do that do you not realize that this be a local clash that turkey never wish to see happen turkey have other plan for region like economic revival co operation etc good stuff in other word be happy to bicker with armenian over trade barrier and such on usenet rather than  who kill whom in what way which i detest do and do bm be you throw the cyprus buzzword around with s c g in the header bm in hope that the greek netters will jump the gun henrik absolutely not i be merely try to emphasize that in many henrik case history repeat itself even if one buy into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke turkey a be do in  74 if there  d be a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiot in athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their family i have no wish to go into the cyprus quarrel but i suspect what say be not only accurate but also palatable to all party involve bm yes indeed turkey have the military prowess to intervene what she wish bm she have however be the diplomatic power to stop the hostility and bring bm the party to the negotiate table hard to do when armenian bm be attack azeri town henrik so let me understand in plain word what you be say turkey henrik want a peaceful end to this conflict not so what do you think we want war death and destruction henrik i will believe it when i see it no if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it henrik now a far a attack what do you do when you see a gun point henrik to your head do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef fat chance this kind of childish rhetoric help anthing henrik do you remember what azeri do to the armenian in baku all the henrik barberian act especially against mother and their child i mean henrik burning people alive now some azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrate by armenian one should re hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right bm armenian leader be lack the statesmanship to recognize the bm futility of arm conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm lead to stability be much well than a military faits accomplis bm go to cause incessant skirmish henrik armenian in karabakh want peace and their own republic they be henrik not ask much they simply want to get back what be take away henrik from them and give to azeri by stalin well they obviously get anywhere with their current method of ask not very peaceful say bm think of 10 or 20 year down the line    both of the newly independent bm country need to develop economically and neither one be go to wipe bm the other out these people will be neighbor would it not be well bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik get me wrong i also want peaceful solution to the henrik conflict but until azeri realize that the armenian in henrik karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion i know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogan peace what  s happen right now furthermore what  s happen right now condusive to peace you can spend day and night rave about how  right the armenian position be and sure there  ll be others who  d be happy to talk to you by argue the other side if entrench position lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise armenia strong enough to exercise the  we think right and we have the bomb so do whatever we want so there     style of foreign relation yes you can type stalin in cap and give one side atrocity story etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side you personally can choose not to do that of course this be just usenet the people in power be so childish bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strike bm your fancy on the map be cost the local armenian dearly in term of bm their blood and future henrik again you be take different turn armenia have no intension henrik to grab any land from azerbaijan the armenian in karabakh henrik be simply defend themselves until a solution be set azeri  s would disagree with you on this and the map see support what be say it seem likely that a solution will be reach in this manner bm easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm craziness to have your feeling about turk tickle the armenian bm in armenia and n k will be there with the same people you seem to hate bm a their neighbor for maybe 3000 year more the sooner there  s peace in bm the region the well it be for them and everyone else push for bm compromise if i be you instead of hit the caps lock and spread bm inflammatory half truth henrik it be not up to me to decide the peace initiative i be absolutely henrik for it it look it when i read your post it would seem to me that if you can spew mis information about a boogey man you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness fair henrik but in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be wipe out such a the case in the era of 1915 20 of henrik the armenian massacre you realize i can say the same thing about  the turkish massacre yes boy and girl let  s always talk about how bad and nasty thing be let  s do that so overwhelmed by anger and let  s do that so our kid will also be hateful sound crazy it do it then

 snip in the first place the death of three soldier on a patrol in occupy lebanese terrritory be not an act of terrorism or murder it be disingeneous to compare their death to that of athlete in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise be aim solely at divert the issue and be far from the truth i agree that the death of three soldier on a patrol etc     be not terrorism that have be say let continue snip imagine it be not a    terrorist camp    a you and the israeli like to view the village they be small community with kid play soccer in the street woman prepare lunch men play card etc        i would not argue that all or even most of the village be    terrorist camp    there be however some which come very close to serve that purpose and that be not to say that other do not function in that way prior to the invasion some young men usually age between 17 to 30 year be member of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitant of the village do not know who these be they be secretive about it but most people often suspect who they be and what they be up to these young men be support financially by iran most of the time they sneak arm and ammunition into the occupy zone where they set up booby trap for israeli patrol every time an israeli soldier be kill or injured by these trap israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing village of their own choose often kill only innocent civilian once they be back they announce that they bombed a    terrorist hideout    where an 8 year old girl just happen to be some of the village and yours might well be among them be a you describe not all be there be a large number of group in the area back by various organization with a wide range of purpose hizbollah and amal be two of the large one and may still be a to retaliation while mistake may be make that be still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing which would have produce major casualty israel  s retalliation policy be cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand be not go to stop it attack on occupy israeli soldier until they withdraw this be the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw well here we disagree i think that israel would willingly withdraw if the lebanese gov t be able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent far attack this be the only realistic solution it be time for israel to realize that the concept of a    buffer zone    aim at protect it northern city have fail in fact it have cause much more israeli death than the occasional shell of northern israel would have result in actually that be not clear at all i will agree that the death toll be no longer civilian and now primarily military though there seem to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstance and now the lebanese government have proven that it be capable of control and disarm all militia a they do in all other part of lebanon no the syrian gov t be more than happy to have israel sink into another lebanese morass i could elaborate if necessary i agree only in the case of the isareli soldier their kill can not be qualify a murder no matter what you say no but it be regretable a be the whole situation

 hi brad i have two comment regard your hope that the    occupation will end     belive that stiff resistance  etc how about an untried approach i e  peace and cooperation i help but wonder what would happen if all violence against israeli stop hopefully violence against arab would stop at the same time if a state of non violence could be maintain perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieve i e  great economic opportunity for both people living in the    territory    of course give the current leadership of israel your way may work also but if that leadership change e g  to someone with ariel sharon  s mentality then i would predict a considerable loss of life i e  no winner secondly regard your comment about the u s  troop respond to    stiff resistance    the analogy be not quite valid the u s  troop could get out of the neighborhood altogether the israeli could not just my  02 worth no offense intend respectfully

 a number of point you be make assumption about the manner in which the card be use true by law all resident citizen and tourist must carry a form of identification with them for citizen the standard id be the id card the purpose this serf on a daily basis wherein they be present at public place be for the purpose of identify the bearer this take place in bank cash check post office register mail and such etc     quite frankly it be rare that i ever have to present my id card for such activity more than once per week there be no law or requirement that force people to wave their id card in public furthermore none of the service i outline discriminate against the bearer in any manner by have access to this information the only case that i can think of in which the le um field might be take into account be during interaction with the police base upon the scenario in general though arab citizen be clearly recognizable a be non arabs your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field be be use to discriminate against them officially i take issue with your assertion i think that arab country do know that they have nothing to fear from    israeli expansionism    militarily israel be not capable of hold onto large tract of land under occupation to a hostile arm and insurgent population for a sustain period of time a be the intifada be heavily tax the israeli economy proof of this can be see in the israeli withdrawal from lebanon israeli troop pull back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minimal strip need to keep town out of range of katyusha missile fire public opinion in israel have turn towards settle the intifada via territorial concession the israel public be sufferring from battle fatigue of sort and the gov t be aware of it with regard to border let me state the follow i may not agree with the manner in which negotiation be be held however the crux of the matter be that everyone either make or refrain from state a start position the arab party have call for total withdrawal and a return to pre 48 border if israel be to state large border the negotiation might never get under way if israel be to state small border then the arab country might try and force even small border during the negotiation i think that leave the matter to be settle by negotiation and peace treaty be infinitely more realistic and sensible your statement be typical of the simple mind naivety of a    center for policy research    whether or not all of vanunu  s revelation be true have no bearing on the fact that some be for disclose    state secret    after have sign contract and form with the understand that say secret be not to be make public one should be punish a to which be and which i be under no moral obligation to disclose that quite the reverse in fact he be take to court try and found guilty you may take issue with a number of thing but clearly you have no understand of the concept of    secret of state    something which every democratic govt have i notice that he be document the fact that such prisoner could exist more than he document the fact that they do exist the clu note which you evidently do not pay attention to that they know of no such report or case i be sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill a tightly knit a israel even if the matter of the arrest be not make public within a relatively short time frame most people would know about it my own feeling be that the matter of the arrest should be make public unless a court order be issue allow a delay of x hour this would be grant only if a judge could be convince that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation well i be sorry to say that your question be slant such question be often term    tabloid journalism    and be not disturb because they avoid any attempt at objectivity such question be often use during the mccarthy era a a basis for the witch hunt that take place then to use your own example these question might have be lift from the format use by stalinist prosecutor that be look for small bit of evidence that they could distort and portray a a large and dirtier picture my answer be not any more    hysterical    than the question themselves the problem be not that the q  s be provocative it be that they be selective in their fact seek you fall into the same category of those who seek    yes       no    answer when the real answer be    of sort    i suspect that a long a the answer to these question be not an unequivocal no you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them a you see fit a sign of strength be the ability to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalist who once advocate cull wolf because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they have broken the food chain and wreak havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect the color blindness you exhibit be a true sign of weakness ditto

 tell me tim what be these guerilla do wrong assume that they be use civilian for cover be they not kill soldier in their country if the buffer zone be to prevent attack on israel be it not work why be it far neccessary for israeli gun to pound lebanese village why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there be more to the shell of the village     it be call retaliation        get back           get even    it make sense to shell the village the least it show be a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the life of civilian if israel be not willing to accept the    word    of others then imho it have no business waste others time come to the peace talk no i be not basil i think basil be a very intelligent person and i respect what he writes basil be a person that i would gladly call a friend he be however not me nor be i lebanese a some seem to suspect tim you be ignore the fact that the palestinian in lebanon have be disarm hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah do not attack israel except at a few time such a when the idf burn up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinate people and shell village they make the lebanese so mad a to do that furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarm it would not be possible tim when be the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh israel know very well that the syrian be able to restrain all who would use territory under their control to attack israel while lebanon would be well off with syria and israel out of it border the presence of syrian troop in lebanon have meant a sharp decrease in attack on israeli territory not on israeli troop in lebanon however please note the distinction in the past two year i disagree basil have always seem to me to be a cool headed person slow to anger certainly more so than i what be most important be that he be an actual witness to thing from the other end of the israeli gun if only the israeli government would remember what it be like when the role be reverse perhaps they would moderate their    retaliation

committee about 50 yard away the sk theater they be show an argentinian film    the abyss    before the film we notice about 60 to 70 people stand near the podium at the city party committee but they be silent there  s no conversation whatsoever and we figure out what be go on that be we knew it be about karabagh but what it be exactly what they be talk about if someone give a speech or not we know we bought our ticket there be 30 or 40 people in the theater this be a very small number for that large movie theater the film start about 30 minute later they stop the film a crowd burst in about 60 people they come up onto the stage well mostly they be young people from 16 to 23 year old they demand that an armenian woman come up onto the stage they use foul language and say that they be go to show what azerbaijani be capable of what they could do to armenian girl i thought what they meant because they have demand a girl specifically marina and i be sit together i told her to move over there be some russian girl sit nearby so that if someone recognize me or if something happen they would take me and not marina it get quiet 2 or 3 girl jumped up to run out but the door be close    only open at the end of the show    and they return to their seat everyone in the theater be look at one another russian azerbaijani people of various nationality but no one react at all no one in the auditorium make a sound they be silent look at one another and gradually start to leave some guy a really fat one say    ok scar them enough let  s leave    they leave slowly pompously it seem to me that those people be not themselves either they have smoke a bunch of    anasha    or have take something else because they all look beastly like they be ready to tear anyone apart then it be all over a though nothing have happen at all the film start up again it be one of those cheerful film which should have only brought pleasure make you happy to be alive we could barely sit to the end so

terrify and go home and say    lyuda go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or    then the crowd run over closer toward our building and stand at the 12 story building

turn out at the 12 story building the azerbaijani neighbor go down and kept them from come in there  s only one entryway there they could stop them they all run up to our building mamma immediately start closing the window afraid that they might throw stone they have stone and they break the window all of them there be very many people we have a large courtyard and packed with people they spill

mamma say    hide there they probably come in there ask something say something and leave    she say    tell them that we live alone here    i imagine that my parent will stand out in the hall alone talk with some sort of beast i go to them and say that i  ll stand together with them i  ll talk with them if they come maybe i can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i remember if i told her anything or not then they open the door like

what have happen speak calmly one of you tell me calmly what have happen    in azerbaijani they say    get out of the apartment leave    i say    ok  go downstairs gather everything we need and leave

be just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor consent lyuda come back to our place and lay under the bed i come to mother be there i remember my supervisor  s telephone number but something have to be do somehow i remember and call and he come to get u he have any idea what be go on he thought we be simply afraid he know that they be kill u and that we have pass between life and death he come and get u and take u to the police precinct there they look u over i be have trouble walk my lung hurt badly it be hard to breathe my supervisor  s name be urshan feyruzovich mamedov the head of our administration they take u there when we be leave i saw a great number of bus full of soldier at the entrance to town the bus be ordinary passenger bus there be very many soldier we left around eleven right after eleven if these people could stop what be happen they could save a great many life because the crowd be move on toward the school and what be go on there i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan because there they murder them all one after the next without stop after u i think 14 people die in microdistrict no 3 and 10 to 12 of them be from building 4 5 and 6  in our building one person die and one old woman die from building 16 the building in front of ours there young azerbaijani men stop the mob and let it into their building incidentally when we be at the neighbor marina call our relative to warn them so they would all know what be happen i call a aunt in microdistrict no 5  they have three neighbor who be armenian i say    run quickly i explain what  s go on hide do what you can just stay alive hide at azerbaijani one who give you away    at that moment three people come in policeman i think they be azerbaijani i be in such awful condition my face be completely distort my lip be puffed up there be blood my eye be swollen no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead be badly cut and one half of my face be push out forward no one would have thought that i would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all i start to scream at those people why do you come who sent you here no one want you here you kill people people yet what be you do here one of the soldier say    scream at u muslim but not from the sumgait police they call in from daghestan    so at that point the daghestan police be there when we get to the police precinct there be an awful lot of police there there be soldier police with dog ambulance fireman i know maybe they be wait for people to bring them the goner and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct i know what they be there for there be also doctor from baku there they examine lyuda and me and say    these woman need to go to the maternity home but we know what to do with the rest    so they take u and i lose contact with my parent my bos everyone my bos say    worry i  ll find you no matter where you be no matter what happens    we go to the hospital there we be examine by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name be she examine u the ambulance be from baku i figure out that the sumgait ambulance do anything they respond to any call people call and neither the police nor the ambulance show any sign of life that doctor look me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good have happen for she become quite glad i even thought to myself    god can it be that nothing all that bad be wrong    she look me over and say    now why be you suffer so you know what your people have be do your people do even bad thing    and i think great i have to deal with her and i felt so bad i thought why i just die so a not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her here i be in this condition and be told about something that our people do i just have the energy to say    how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours already do    i stayed there then they brought in another woman ira b  she be married and she be rap in her own apartment too there be three of u ira lyuda and 1  the next morning they take lyuda and ira away they do anything to help u this be in the old maternity home in the combine block they do anything more than examine me that be it i want any shot or tranquilizer nothing what shot could have calm me down i even want to look at them i lay in the ward either it just work out that way or they do it on pur  pose but i be alone i be alone even though the ward be packed that same even a woman come by and ask me what be wrong with me that my face be disfigure she ask what have happen to me and i say    well to ask your brother what happen there  s no point in ask me your brother can well explain what happen    she fell into a faint all the doctor threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward then people from work come to see me my bos his daughter they brought me clothing because i be literally naked the only thing i have on be a dress but the woman who give it to me be very short and the dress be way up above my knee and the woman orderly say    i believe you put on such a short dress who be you show off your leg to here    i go back to my ward think just one more thing from something people from work come and brought me something in a sack apple i think three or four pound but i take them i have become so weak that it be just embarrass i say that i take the apple and really have any appetite no one have to bring me anything some woman take the sack and oh yes then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i be an armenian maybe they figure it out from look at me so they must have be think that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be bad or perhaps someone be outside on the street i know in any case i sleep a wink that night the next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we go i even know where they be take me they take me to the club where the troop be the very one i be in that ill fated even i get off the bus near the city party committee there be a great many troop tank armored personnel carrier the whole scene be terrible i saw a few people i knew there and that calm me a little i have already thought that i be the only one left so there be five or six of u left in sumgait after that night i still know what happen to my parent they come to see me in the hospital and my bos told me that everything be fine i know whether to believe him or not maybe he be just try to calm me down maybe something happen on the way then i go to the club and saw a lot of people i knew they all knew one another they be all kiss each other and ask    what happen what go on    two day later they come to see me from work they be there all the time each day they come show interest and be constantly bring me money they do everything they could of course most thankful to my bos the only one of my colleague who lose his presence of mind and who change his opinion neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happen he constantly take an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two day later the secretary of the party committee come not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours be part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town he make arrangement with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sat down by myself i get up or lie down again there be something wrong with my lung it be hard to breathe they examine me there several time there i lay be several doctor they all thought that that it must just be from all the blow i know they diagnose anything in particular when i be in the maternity home i even ask i make it a point of insist that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful there be no way something inside broken my rib well they take me there and take x ray and say that everything be fine there be emergency medical worker on duty in the club the mother of one of marina  s friend be there she be the head doctor at the sumgait child  s clinic they have every kind of antifever agent in the world which be exactly what i need at that moment i thought i say that i be have great difficulty breathing i seem to get enough air something be wrong with me they put tight bandage around my chest and waist later i overheard some people say that i have be cut all over i think they just saw me be all bandage up and decide that my breast and face have be cut but i cut they take u to the khimik boarding house we live there a long time soon appear representative they be agitate at first people would not talk to them and drove them off one of the armenian woman shout    we demand that seidov come    the response be    seidov who sent u    seidov be the chairman of the azerbaijani council of minister the woman say    only see seidov  s daughter have her come here do the same thing to her that they do to our daughter and then deal with you agitator    and so on more of them say    have seidov himself come    this go on day in day out the agitator kept come and come this drove u out of our wit then people gradually start depart for yerevan because they realize it be senseless to stay everything get on our nerve the smell the small child there be child at the sk club child who have literally just come out of the maternity home what be they do in a club that even have run water all the time at first we have to pay to eat there they even overcharge u a it turn out on the second day someone told u that they would bring u food for free the child be ill  everything stank there well imagine about 3 000 people in a small movie theater with seat for no more than 500  you sit or lie down it be impossible to even move the stench be awful even the small infant take ill overnight there i heard that they be arrive seriously ill in yerevan the infant they have to be wash they have to be bath not to mention that we the adult be ill and need care people be fainting right and left i just know everyone be cry everyone only the young people the men somehow manage to keep it together but the woman be in a constant state of panic it seem to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seem clear that we have be gather together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there be a single armenian left then people go up to the attic i see them i only heard them because i be lie down and get up i lay right on the stage we have some room there apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas i think they want to burn the theater maybe someone saw them i i be in no condition to open my eye everyone be suspicious of everyone else they would ask    you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewhere i think an azerbaijani    they lead out all the men and start let them back in by check their passport relative might be cover for each other half of the people do not have any document there be people who have run out of their home in nothing but a pair of pant and slipper or wear just a shirt not like they should have with their id so on the 28th on sunday i think the police do nothing to help u on monday everything resume where it have left off on block 41a they spare a soul there not child not pregnant woman nobody they kill they burn they hack with ax just everything possible they murder the melkumian family whom i knew my mother work with them their daughter  in law go to school with my old sister they be brutally murder only the two daughter in law survive by a miracle one be able to save herself she ran away the neighbor take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge she be pregnant and have two small child this all continued on monday in block 41a on the 29th when the troop be already in the city they murder people they overturn automobile and they burn entire family they say they even know for sure if the people be armenian or not i heard that the lezgins suffer too not sure myself i see any lezgins who have be injured they burn car so very difficult now to say exactly who die and who it be very difficult to identify the corps or rather what remain of the corps after they be douse in gasoline and burn all very hard to imagine of course i heard that many people disappear without a trace from the btz plant two people include a woman who work the night shift aunt razmella who also live in microdistrict 3  they be stop bus between baku and sumgait in the even people who have be visit baku be return to sumgait and people from baku be go home from sumgait and there be student too they be simply savagely murder they be stop the bus the driver immediately do what they be told because there be just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally mind people they stop the bus drag the armenian out and kill them on the spot i see it myself but i heard that they put them all in a pile so a to burn them later it be hard to discern from the corps well you call them corps you have to figure out from the ash who it be l heard that two fellow save two woman one a student ira g  if not mistaken she be in the hospital a long time after that and she still figure out who save her she be also brutally rap and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corps the fellow pull her out of that whole pile of corps put his coat on her take her into his arm and carry her to the city i still imagine how he manage to do that i heard that from engels grigorian he know her apparently well a lot of people go to that hospital anyway she be in the hospital and sing a song in armenian and they write the word down and i think he still have that piece of paper because he say that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape they find the guy who save her he left her in someone  s apartment and call the ambulance she be in such awful shape that probably like me she remember anyone  s face i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe i have talk with him once but i receive so many blow everything be just knock out of my head i remember to this day who he be then it seem i saw the secretary of the directorate  s party organization where marina work she go to school and work she go to night school at azi and work by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretary of party and komsomol organization we have joint meeting i know them all even talk with them and he i know be from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it become obvious that many of those people be azerbaijani born in armenia they take me to various police station to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy get involve in the case and i iden  tified the photograph of people who i could more or less recognize they show me the people who be in our apartment work on our case but i even recognize them although it be prove that they be the one processing it somehow they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they be drag me there be someone else in our apartment who do not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of them a much a heard about them and see them they be all from kafan the secretary of the party organization be name najaf najaf rzayev he be there when everything start it must have be him because i recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him all the more since i told him    listen you do something because you know me    he turn away and go toward the bedroom where marina be well you see marina anyway there be such a noisy confusion of people that you make out anyone all of it flew right out of my head and then gradually i become myself again at the city party committee there be military people there i told them what go on and they write it all down i told them his name on march 8 the secretary of our first trust party organization the one part of come to see u his name be najaf rzayev i tell mamma    if here despite the fact that i give his name it mean that either his alibi have be confirm or probably that they think crazy not responsible for my word    he say    what do they do to you how awful myself i hid an armenian family    then after some time go by he come back again and say something entirely different    i at home my family and i go to baku    i say    marina what be he say he say something totally different before    after that i go to see our procurator our case be be handle by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov told me that rzayev  s case have just gotten to him and there be so name involve what be they do with rzayev do he prove his alibi or not they just think that since i be hit in the head i say anything for sure whether it be him or not it will be an insult if he be in our apartment and have to pay for it but at the same time afraid to say a hundred percent sure that it be he because no mat  ter who i name they tell me no wrong he do that that one there all the face have gotten mixed up in my mind who do what exactly i say when they take me outside there be a whole crowd there but i see it because i have my eye close all the time it seem to me that i always get it because of my eye people be always hassle me for some reason it always seem to me that my eye be responsible when they be beating my face i thought they be try to put my eye out so i have my eye close they take me outside and start to beat me a young guy 22 held my arm he work at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from u block 41 be where all this be go on right across the road from u the btz dormitory be over there where he life now in custody they even have prove a far a i know that it be he who kill shurik gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building one person in our building be kill it be that man a guy come by who share a room with the guy who be hold me he saw that he be hold me by the arm and that he be beating me but he come over he just look and then go into the dormitory a while after it be all over people start make announcement in town say that investigator have be summon that guy go and told them everything now they  ve caught him everything  s be prove now evidently they  ve be beating him i know what do with them over there but he himself say that he be work the night shift at the plant some young guy come to the plant and say    everyone who want to kill armenian come to the bus station on saturday at ten    that be it he say the one who want to go this be at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night it be at night they be at the sauna together and he say what do you mean do you understand what you be say the others be silent probably in their heart they be think go to go but they say anything to one another he say that he thought it important to to go because he have heard a lot about what have happen in kafan that they have kill their azerbaijani sister their mother burn village and all of that that guy be also born in kafan that be certain and marina say that the secretary of the party organization be from armenia too from participate in the investigation a couple of time satisfied with them thus far they summon u and ask about what happen and every word i say be record i met some guy there by the way he be an armenian i say that he be in our apartment but what he do i know his last name be grigorian eduard grigorian he s from sumgait from microdistrict 1  he be sentence i think to five year not his first time his mother be russian i met with him at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they take u there and show me photograph there be so many photograph i think they even photograph those people who be caught at curfew and get them all confuse i say the face be about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasp but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like look for a needle in a haystack well this guy grigorian i say he be in our apartment but he be so light complected that he look like a lezgin i know what he do i remember maybe he beat me or rap me but he be in our apartment at the kgb he start ask me plead with me there  s no need for this all this stuff look me in the eye like a sister to me i take a look at him and thought    my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you    but they be satisfied with my response because i say everything without great certainty i be there with mamma then lyuda come in but when she come in she get sick immediately she want to kill him she crawl over the table at him she recognize him when she come to lyuda be lie on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom we have all kind of box with dish in them the dowry for all three sister they stole everything in the apartment leave only small thing at that moment lyuda come to and start remember everything well see the face hearing the voice two people be say they could burn the apartment another say why burn the apartment when get three kid and no place to live so this guy be in temporary housing he have anywhere to live he be from sumgait they be sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbor be azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijani what they say how do they know there be azerbaijani there if they just picked a place think that armenian live there we have a list of the resident for our part of the building our name be in there but how could they know that azerbaijani live on the other side of the wall from u so they set fire to our apartment i know i be in such bad shape that if all of it have come to a halt when i be outside if someone have ask me what be happen i would have say that a civil war be go on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they be beating me i open my eye and saw that all the neighbor be stand on their balcony and watch like at a free horror film so a civil war be go on and only the armenian be be fought if it be a world war or something like that they would have be fight everyone but they only fought u then i met some woman from our building some azerbaijani they be cry they tell me    karina we saw all of it how could it happen    ask me well i just know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happen to me i think that if it be the other way around either i have be able to take it or i would have try to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman do in front of our building a woman life there an awful dissipate woman if you can call her a woman the dissipate life she lead two armenian family live there in her part of the building she come out on the balcony and saw what be happen to me and start to scream and curse she come down to the entryway and say    come in this entryway over my dead body    so not one of them take it in his head to go in that entryway some folk be say that those people be so out of control that they even know what they be do i think true they knew very well what they be do if they even lift a hand against that woman they have care less about her but the fact that she be an azerbaijani stop them they be just beast they have smoke so much when they come to our place they be all chew something i notice everyone who come into the apartment be chew something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe lose my mind but no all chew something maybe it be some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seem to be such normal people young clean shaven look exactly a if they have come to some sort of celebration but they be shout something they talk they shout a though there be deaf people there they scream and scream    yeah kill kill kill the armenian    only they shout    kill    they shout    gurun ermianlary    gurun literally mean    kill    or    destroy    how it be i  ll continue we hid in a captain  s apartment an azerbaijani his wife be a tatar we be sit in their apartment their kid be out in the yard their kid knew a whole lot this be in our part of the building on the third floor when mamma come to and find lyuda she take papa  s hand this be while the looter be steal thing but they pay attention because they be steal thing apparently they have already cease kill and switch to steal mamma found the courage to a boy say to my mother    where  s the gold    mamma say he must have be 12 to 14 year old he even look russian he be so fair skinned but the azerbaijani from armenia be fair skinned i notice they be all on the fair side he shout they be all smash thing and he asks mamma where the gold be we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important paper in a little black bag we kept everything in there mamma really like to wear gold she probably never even wore those thing from the time they be bought for her they take everything that be lie on the cheval glass mamma think that the gold save u because they threw themselves at the gold and mamma grabbed papa who be try to breathe they have close his mouth bound his hand and put a pillow and a chair on his face they have shove something into his mouth so he would suffocate mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off he have something in his mouth he be have trouble breathing his nose be fill with blood mamma grabbed him and start run from the fifth down to the first floor because no one want to open their door to them mamma say that by accident completely by accident that person open his door he be sleep and say half awake    what  s happen    he see that they be bloody mamma say    at least go and find out what  s happen to my daughter even if they  ve burn them or murder them at least bring the corps    he go look for u at that moment lyuda be under the bed she say that after they left it seem that someone be call her name when he quietly call her she get out from under the bed she want to get out and be call softly she thought she be shout but in fact she be either silent or be only talk to herself it just seem to her that she be shout when she get out from under the bed everyone be go and again she thought that she have lose her mind i  ll never leave here never to hell with it it just seem that way to me i  ll come to eventually but then when everything have settle down stop that mall brought lyuda down and igor carry me in from outside or first i be brought in then lyuda i remember what order it happen in and mamma say    listen all run around down there shout something or other and run toward the other building    it have more or less

 i will try to answer some of dorin  s question even though they be not address to me specifically but i feel that i be a bit concerned by the thread since i be a southern lebanese from a village that be often on the receive end of israel  s bomb in the first place the death of three soldier on a patrol in occupy lebanese terrritory be not an act of terrorism or murder it be disingeneous to compare their death to that of athlete in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise be aim solely at divert the issue and be far from the truth it seem to me dorin that you be so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comment can only be charactrized a irrelevant and heavily color by the preconception and misinformation i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of what the situation really be in south lebanon i be i be back in my home village this last summer for your information we be people not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorist most of the people in my village be regular inhabitant that go about their daily business some work in the field some own small shop others be old men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee be that so hard to imagine it be not a    terrorist camp    a you and the israeli like to view the village they be small community with kid play soccer in the street woman prepare lunch men play card etc        some young men usually age between 17 to 30 year be member of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitant of the village do not know who these be they be secretive about it but most people often suspect who they be and what they be up to these young men be support financially by iran most of the time they sneak arm and ammunition into the occupy zone where they set up booby trap for israeli patrol every time an israeli soldier be kill or injured by these trap israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing village of their own choose often kill only innocent civilian once they be back they announce that they bombed a    terrorist hideout    where an 8 year old girl just happen to be we be now accustom to israeli tactic and we figure that this be the israeli way of tell u that    if gon na hurt our soldier gon na pay the price    we accept this a a price we have to pay to free our land israel know very well that it be not really hurt the resistance that much militarily with these strike but rather just keep the pressure on the villager to demand from their young men to stop attack israeli soldier since these attack be take a heavy toll on the life of the civilian villager israel  s retalliation policy be cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand be not go to stop it attack on occupy israeli soldier until they withdraw this be the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw the people of south lebanon be occupy or shell by israel on a regular basis we do not want to be occupy if israel insists that the so call    security zone    be necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of it occupation with the blood of it soldier if israel be interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land we be not ask for the establishment of a lebanese occupy zone in northern israel to protect our village that be attack on a regular basis by israel so the best policy seem to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keep troop along the border i have write before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come a a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to it own border and peace keep troop be station along the border to insure no one on either side of the border be shell this be the only realistic solution it be time for israel to realize that the concept of a    buffer zone    aim at protect it northern city have fail in fact it have cause much more israeli death than the occasional shell of northern israel would have result in if israel really want to save some israeli life it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called    security zone    before the conclusion of the peace talk such a move would save israeli life advance peace effort give israel a great moral lift well israel  s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it be genuinely interested in peace and have already offer some important concession along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarm by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attack against it northern city and that if such a shell occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it there seem to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstance and now the lebanese government have proven that it be capable of control and disarm all militia a they do in all other part of lebanon i agree only in the case of the isareli soldier their kill can not be qualify a murder no matter what you say i have the feel that you may be able yourself to make yes we have no quarrel with jew or israeli civilian the real problem be with occupy israeli soldier and those brave israeli pilot that bomb our civilian village every time an occupy soldier be attack

reestablish themselves in the balkan there be considerable turmoil among the jewish community in central and western europe even if the difficulty of the darker century immediately precede the fourteenth be minimize it be easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life particularly when compare to life in europe held for the jew there be no way to tell how many jew left christendom for the realm of the rise muslim ottoman but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian country it be record that some jew flee to ottoman territory the regularity of these report suggests that the ottoman be consider reasonably tolerant protector and that there be a regular trickle of jewish family move southward and eastward from western and central europe     it be evident that the effect of plague late crusade and the general intolerance and persecution of jew in christian europe result in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which for more than two century be to be orient toward muslim east  page 21 in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community be rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief

european coreligionist apprise them of the situation and urge them to migrate this remarkable letter advise it recipient not only of the pleasant condition in the ottoman domain but described a well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy place an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be bury there  page 41     the impression gain from the hebrew source be that the jew be firmly aware of the community of interest which exist between them and the ottoman especially in comparison to relation with the christian of europe confirmation of the commonality of interest between muslim and jew be also indicate by the fact that european christian perceive the jew a ally of islam and be well aware of muslim jewish cooperation certainly the activity of important jewish financier and politician represent the ottoman government abroad do not pas unnoticed european source be the basis for much of our knowledge of their career in addition it appear that christian pirate plunder    turk and jew    their sworn enemy and that european consider the jew to be agent who regularly report to the ottoman there be well known example of overt jewish support for the ottoman in the struggle against european power the two best know instance of jewish support for the campaign ottoman be the frequently cite instance of the jewish contribution to the conquest of buda in the early sixteenth century and of rhodes we also have report of sympathy for the ottoman during the siege of chios an unpublished ottoman document show dramatically the mutual interest which exist in some greek town     page 43 it be clear that throughout the sixteenth century it be a generally accepted fact that the interest of jew and muslim coincide frequently and all party involve jew muslim and christian be aware of the situation  page 46     it seem that the relation between greek and jew be not particularly cordial the two group have little in common few common interest and perceive no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve a the basis for cooperation rather than enmity if there be any identifiable bond of good will which exist between religious community in the fifteenth and sixteenth century it be that between muslim and jew neither of whom have much in common with the orthodox  page 46 the general impression of muslim jewish relation in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth century be one of community of interest from the early time the ottoman seem to have welcome jew to their territory and to have found in the community already exist in place which they conquer a cooperative element the jewish response to this tolerance be a steady flow of jew from christian country to ottoman domains  page 151 from the period before 1453 we have only a few indication that the ottoman jewish relationship be well on the course of amity which would characterize it for year afterward but the liberality of the ottoman in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantine and the protection and the security which the ottoman offer in comparison to condition elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the ottoman and the jew recognize their mutual interest     page 161 it be impossible to say how fundamental the jew be in the success of the ottoman in rebuild istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century that they played an important role in both can not be doupted it be also unclear whether they be important enough to say that the ottoman would not have experienced their great success without the jew and that no other group could have be found to serve the ottoman a well a do the jew it be however unmistakably clear that there be few parallel in world history to this remarkable partnership between jew and the non jewish society in which they live we must conclude that the ottoman could probably not achieve their success without a group perform certain task for them a well a the jew do

 after a small refresh hasan get on the track again i get the impression hasan realize he goofed and be now try to drop the thread let him it might save some miniscule portion of his sorry face not really since i be a logical person who like further himself from any    name call    i start trash any article that contains such abuse without respond to and sometimes not even reading article write by those who acquire such bad habit from bad company ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the way never bother respond to   there be no name calling hence the assumption do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer or to refresh your memory do the human right issue in the area apply to palestinian only also do you claim there be such a thing a forfeit a human right if possible then explain to the rest of u how there can exist any such thing use your logic and convince u this be your golden chance jonas flygare well ok  let  s see what master of wisdom mr  jonas flygare write that can be wisdomely respond to be you call name or give me a title if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestineans be there for 18 month and they be come back when you agree to give palestineans their human rights afterall human right arenot negotiable correct me if wrong but the right to one  s life _also_ a  human right or do it only apply to palestinian no it be everybody  s right however when a killer kill then he be give up  willingly or unwillingly his life  s right to the society the society represent by the goverment would exercise it duty by deprive the killer off his life  s right so then all right for israel to kill the people who kill israeli the old  eye for an eye think funny i thought modern legal system be make to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom                                                                                                        if you insist on give me names titles i do not ask for you could at least spell them correctly  sigh when you be intentionally neglect the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupy territory be illegitimate and hence all their action their court their law be illegitimate on the ground of occupy territory no i be _not_ neglect that merely ask you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individual right to live a a you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be use in the territory later also you have not adressed my question if the israeli also have human right what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i do explain my point in the post that you    respond to    the point be that since israel be occupy then it be automatically deprive itself from some of it right to the occupy palestineans which be exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all citizen of human right by it action then tell me why _any_ human living today should have any right at all in conjugtion with the above when a group of people occupies others territory and rule them by force then this group would be  willingly or unwillingly  deprive from some of it right such a the right to live nice the swedish government be a group of people that rule me by force do that give me the right to kill them do you consider yourself that you have pose a worthy question here worthy or not i be just apply your logic to a related problem be i to assume you admit it hold what kind of right and how much would be deprive be another issue the answer be to be found in a certain system such a international law u law israeli law     and now very convenient to start use the legal system to prove a point   excuse me while i throw up ok master of wisdom be throw up you people stay away from the screen while he be do it oh do you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone i  ll let you in on a secret     not for real   take my word for it it seem that the u law  represented by u state dept in this case  be look to the other way around when violence occurs in occupy territory anyway a for hamas then obviously they turn to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question be not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the law of minister sharon say kick palestineans out of here all palestine i ask for which system should be use that will preserve human right for all people involve i assume that be obvious but i repeat that mistake now that i have straighten that out eagerly await your reply joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization say it best when write in his diary in 1940    between ourselves it must be clear that there be no room for both people together in this country     we shall not achieve our goal         of be an independent people with the arab in this small country the only solution be a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arab     and there be no other way than to transfer the arab from here to the neighbour country to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left     only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the million of our own brother there be no other way out    davar 29 september 1967    courtesy    of marc afifi just a question if we be to disregard the rather obvious reference to get israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter the english translation if you have other information be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a _private_ paper even old not go to get into the question if he write the above but fairly obvious all party in the conflict have their share of fanatic guess what   those be not the people that will make any last peace in the region ever those who be willing to make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get something back    we    and    our    either refers to zionist or jew i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solve the me problem i think that be fair enough no that be _not_ an answer since i ask for a system that could solve the problem you say any could be use then you provide a contradiction guess where that take your logic to never never land    the great problem of zionism be arab child     rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quote you put at the end be a real bummer when i try give your post any credit
 it be not a    terrorist camp    a you and the israeli like to view the village they be small community with kid play soccer in the street woman prepare lunch men play card etc        some young men usually age between 17 to 30 year be member of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitant of the village do not know who these be they be secretive about it but most people often suspect who they be and what they be up to these young men be support financially by iran most of the time they sneak arm and ammunition into the occupy zone where they set up booby trap for israeli patrol every time an israeli soldier be kill or injured by these trap israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing village of their own choose often kill only innocent civilian this a    try and true    method utilized by guerilla and terrorist group to conduct operation in the midst of the local populace thus force the oppose    state    to possible harm innocent civilian in their search or in order to avoid the death of civilian abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover be  also  to blaim for drag the innocent civilian into harm  s way be you suggest that when guerilla use the population for cover israel should totally back down so     the easy way to get away with attack another be to use an innocent a a shield and hope that the other respect innocent life tell me tim what be these guerilla do wrong assume that they be use civilian for cover be they not kill soldier in their country if the buffer zone be to prevent attack on israel be it not work why be it far neccessary for israeli gun to pound lebanese village why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there be more to the shell of the village     it be call retaliation        get back           get even    it make sense to shell the village the least it show be a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the life of civilian please clarify your standard for rule of engagement a i understand it israeli be at all time and under all circumstance fair target their opponent be legitimate target only when mirandized or some such sure that this make perfect sense if you grant  a priori  that israeli be the black hat and that therefore kill them be automatically a good thing go hezbollah the corollary be that the hezbollah be the white hat and that whatever they do be a good thing and the israeli only prove themselves to be bad guy by attack them this sound suspiciously like a hockey fan i know who cheer when one of the player on his team us his stick to permanently rearrange an opponent  s face and curse the ref for penalize his side of course when different when the role be reverse
 sorry i misread your remark about young men and woman though i be now unsure what that sentence do mean you imply that anyone who want to send troop to bosnia want to do so to help the    butcher of their choice    since the primary target of help be muslim victim of    ethnic cleanse    you imply that such muslim victim be butcher this implies both side be equal true it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side be the victim but that do not mean that victim do not exist would you in wwii have say that there be atrocity on the side of both the jew and the german yes but both side want different thing the muslim chiefly want to not be    ethnic cleanse    the serbian want to    ethnic cleanse    the muslim it be indeed true that each side will stop when it get what it want but the thing that the two side want be not equivalent i recall before we do anything for somalia apparent left winger say that the reason everyone be more willing to send troop to bosnia than to somalia be because the somali be third worlders who american consider unworthy of help they suddenly shut up when the u decide to send troop to the opposite place than that predict by the theory for that matter this theory of yours suggests that american should want to help the serb after all christian and the muslim be not if the desire to intervene in bosnia be base on racism against people that be less like u why do everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like u especially if both of the side be equal a you seem to think       on the first day after christmas my truelove serve to me     leftover turkey on the second day after christmas my truelove serve to me     turkey casserole that she make from leftover turkey day 3 4 delete     flame turkey wing        pizza hut commercial and m tlu a gic bait

 most of brad post delete tell me do these young men also attack syrian troop there must be a guarantee of peace before this happens it seem that many of these lebanese youth be unable to restrain themselves from violence and unable to to realize that their action prolong israel stay in south lebanon if the lebanese army be able to maintain the peace then israel would not have to be there until it be israel prefers that it soldier die rather than it child israel should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty be sign not a day before withdraw because of casualty would tell the lebanese people that all they need to do to push israel around be kill a few soldier it not gon na happen why should israel not demand this while hold the buffer zone it seem to me that the well bargaining position be while hold your neighbor land if lebanon be willing to agree to those condition israel would quite probably have left already unfortunately it seem that the lebanese can disarm the hizbolah and maintain the peace adam adam shostack adam das harvard edu

 in my posting i have make a proposal for comment and discussion those who want to discus it merit and drawback be not force to do so however i would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner legally responsible for their deed i can not accept and will not accept threat to my personal integrity and i urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threat p my proposal have nothing to do with nazi eugenics it have to do with the search for peace which would enable justice i consider that justice be do when non jew who flee or be expel in 1948 1967 be not permit to return to their homeland this can at best be call pragmatism a nice word for legitimize the rule of the strong it can never be call justice and peace without justice will never be peace it be my conviction that the situation in which a state through the law attempt to discourage mixed marriage a israel do be not normal such a state resembles more nazi germany and south africa than western democracy such a the united state in which jew be free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousand my proposal may have drawback but it be meant to force anybody to anything just to compensate for a certain time mixed couple for the hardship tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage when the day will come and israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society in which the state be not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of it constituency such a fund would not be need any more i mind if jew wish to marry jew and keep their tradition why not but this be not the affair of a state western democracy clearly separate these domain and i be certain that most american jew enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state term christian state and to have their green card stamp with a mark jew i would ask those who be genuinely interested in an exchange of view and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile outburst which might leed reader to infer that jew who respect judaism be uncivilized such behaviour be not good for judaism

 would it be ask too much for you to document these allegation of    israel use to arrest and kill neutral reporter    i think you confuse israel with other nation of that geographical region to which the notion of a free unmonitored by the government press corp would be a joke
 stuff delete be you call name or give me a title if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again hasan reply i didnot know that    master of wisdom    can be    name clling    too unless you consider yourself deserve less unless you be refer to someone else you have in fact give me a name i do not ask for hence the term  name call so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom                                                                                                        i reply if you insist on give me names titles i do not ask for you could at least spell them correctly  sigh hasan gloat that be only to confuse you ha ha ha hey hell bent on retard into childhood no when you be intentionally neglect the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupy territory be illegitimate and hence all their action their court their law be illegitimate on the ground of occupy territory no i be _not_ neglect that merely ask you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individual right         be you try to retaliate and confuse me here no i really do try to spell correctly and i apologize if i do confuse you i will try not to repeat that to live a a you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be use in the territory later also you have not adressed my question if the israeli also have human right first my above statement doesnot say that    the existence of israeli citizen in the wb revoke their right of life    but it say    the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most it citizen basically revoke the right of for it military men    clearly occupation be an undeclared war during war attack against military target be fully legitimate ok let me re phrase the question i have repeatedly ask you if the israeli have less human right than the palestinian and if so why from your post where you do not directly adress my question i infer that you thought so together with the above statement i then assume that the reason be the action of the state of israel re your statement of occupation like you to define the term so i have to repeat this  drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human right but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdraw from the occupy terretories not by far oppress palestinean human right sorry but the above sentence do not make sense please rephrase it if a state can deprive all citizen of human right by it action then tell me why _any_ human living today should have any right at all because not all state be like israel a oppressive a ignorant or a tyrant oh ok  so how about the human right of the syrian iraqi and others do the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurd in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched   the russian in the baltic state or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serb have any human right remainaing accord to you and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question be not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the law of minister sharon say kick palestineans out of here all palestine i ask for which system should be use that will preserve human right for                                                                             all people involve i assume that be obvious but i repeat that mistake now that i have straighten that out eagerly await your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human right i be understand this from your first statement in this paragraph no agree that to just kick all the palestinian out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both party if what you refer to a the  israeli solution then so be it joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization say it best when write in his diary in 1940    between ourselves it must be clear that there be no room for both people together in this country     we shall not achieve our goal         of be an independent people with the arab in this small country the only solution be a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arab     and there be no other way than to transfer the arab from here to the neighbour country to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left     only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the million of our own brother there be no other way out    davar 29 september 1967    courtesy    of marc afifi oh have you met with them personally to read their diary fascinate what do you _do_ for a living above you write that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be use to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly an unjust solution would be a non solution per definition no you say the follow for all a it hold that a have property b  there exists an a such that property b do not hold thus either or both statement must be false guess where that take your logic to never never land i be merely point out a not so small flaw in your reason since you claim to be logical i felt it best to point this out before you start use your statement to prove a point or so be i then to assume you be not logical any quote can be misuse especially when use to stereotype all individual by a statement of an individual if you use the same method that you credit  zionists with then where do that place you oh by the way advice you not to assume anything about my  loyalties i will and be condemn act i find vile and inhuman but i  ll try a long a i can not to assume those act be by a whole people by zionist above do you mean the state of israel the government of israel the leader of israel political and or religious or the jew in general if you feel the need to condemn condemn those responsible instead how would you feel if we start condemn you personally base on the bombing in egypt
 base on the same reason you mean you be oppose to u intervention in somalia because since somalia be a european country instead of the third world the desire to help somalia be racist i think this    same reason    applies to somalia at all the whole point be that somalia _is_ a third world country and we be more willing to send troop there than to bosnia    exactly the _opposite_ of what the    fixation on european country    theory would predict similarly the desire to help muslim be fought by christian be also exactly the opposite of what that theory predicts refer to people who want to help at all of course you see people send out press release    help bosnian serb with ethnic cleanse the muslim presence in the balkan should be eliminate now    well except for some serb but i admit that the desire of serb in america to help the serbian side probably _is_ because those be people more like them       on the first day after christmas my truelove serve to me     leftover turkey on the second day after christmas my truelove serve to me     turkey casserole that she make from leftover turkey day 3 4 delete     flame turkey wing        pizza hut commercial and m tlu a gic bait

for century in at least a much tranquility and liberty a their fellow turkish subject all be expose alike to the rapacity of their common ruler to one brought up a most american have be in the gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the jew in turkey be almost a mathematical demonstration that religious difference have have an influence in the tragedy of turkey only a they be combine with aspiration for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treat a treasonable one readily reach the conclusion that the jew in turkey be fortunate        he also state that    they armenian traitorously turn turkish city over to the russian invader that they boast of have raise an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burn at least a hundred turkish village and exterminate their population    turkey and the holocaust an interview with stanford j  shaw history who recently complete two book the jew of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic and turkey and the holocaust turkey  s role in rescue turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution 1933 45  shaw chair the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern study and have organize the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry he be affiliate with the g  e  von grunebaum center for near eastern study editor how do you come to write these two book on turkey and european and turkish jew shaw basically an ottoman historian but also jewish spent twenty five year study ottoman history and a time go along whenever i found material on the ottoman jew i collect them but i never do anything with them until a couple of year ago when i suddenly realize that 1992 be the 500th anniversary of the jew be expel from spain and come to turkey then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invite me to give a series of three lecture on ottoman jewry these lecture be greatly appreciate and i become motivate to undertake far research to develop a book the jew of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic this book be quite different from the work of most jewish historian who tend to look at the jew in any country more from the viewpoint of the jew and the jewish community and rely mainly on jewish source i view my subject a an ottoman historian and i approach the jew of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society use largely ottoman source after i finish this book and sent it to the press i come across additional document relate to turkish jew during world war ii in the complete book i have say that turkey have do a good deal to rescue the jew during world war ii but i do not actually have many detail then i found a batch of document in the foreign ministry archive relate to action take by turkish diplomat to help the jew before and during the holocaust it be too late to add this new information to the book in press so i decide to write a second book i conduct far research mainly in the archive of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in paris the result be the second book turkey and the holocaust which detail how turkey help rescue jew from the nazi how exactly do they do this the story take place over a number of year the book present the material in three part first of which deal with the period before the holocaust when the nazi come to power in germany in 1933 they immediately start dismiss jew and anti nazi german from university hospital scientific institute and the like turkey at that moment be just begin the process of reform it university and it saw in these jew who be be fire from their position in germany a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish university within three month after the nazi start dismiss these jew turkey arrange to take many of them in they be brought to turkey and be give appointment a professor in the turkish university a head of scientific institute and a medical personnel in hospital about 300 to 500 major jewish professor come to turkey in the 1930s ernst reuter a german political scientist spent the war year teach political science in turkey after world war ii he be mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift fritz neimark a major german jewish economist come to turkey and help establish a modern school of economics in istanbul a man name reichenbach who be rescue from the nazi by turkey and spent the war year in turkey eventually come to ucla where he become a professor of philosophy other german jewish emigre engage in cultural activity in turkey one such be karl ebert who have be a lead theatrical producer in berlin until he be expel by the nazi he go to turkey where he organize the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth so the first section of the book cover this first phase when jew be be persecute in germany and rescue by turkey oddly enough the german emigre when they be in turkey do not seem to think too badly of germany they regard themselves more a german than jew and they do not join in the anti nazi activity of the local turkish jewish community i even found letter from the nazi representative to turkey praise these german jewish refugee for their work in promote the idea of german culture even though these people have be persecute by the nazi and rescue by the turk they share the nazi feeling of aryan racial superiority over the turk the second part of the book deal with the holocaust which begin in 1940 when the nazi occupy france in europe at that time and especially in france there be about 20 000 turkish jew they have migrate to europe for various reason from about the turn of the century onward most of them have settle in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i when greece be threaten to overrun turkey the greek have persecute the jew throughout the nineteenth century and the jew fear what might happen to them if the greek take over in turkey many jew flee to france during the 1920s and 1930s many also abandon their turkish citizenship and become french citizen suddenly the nazi invade france in 1940 and start introduce all sort of anti jewish law the turkish jew soon found that it be not worth very much to be a french jew but that it be worth a lot to be a turkish jew how so turkey remain neutral through most of world war ii it retain it embassy and consulate in all the nazi occupied country until it finally enter the war on the side of the ally at the end of 1944  during the war therefore turkey be in a position to defend it citizen against anti jewish measure and the action that turkish diplomat take form the second chapter of the book turkish diplomat who be station in france in particular intervene to protect jew of turkish citizenship from the nazi for those turkish jew who have retain their turkish citizenship there be generally no problem if they be arrest and sent to a concentration camp the turkish diplomat would communicate with the commander of the camp and other official and say in effect    these people be turkish citizen you do this to them    and the turkish jew would be release if their business be confiscate the turkish diplomat would protest and the business would be restore the nazi in general want to keep the friendship of turkey they hop to be able to use turkey a a gateway for an invasion of the middle east and they also want to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey in order to keep turkish friendship they usually accepted these intervention on behalf of turkish jew the turkish diplomat sometimes go to the concentration camp to secure the release of turkish jew at time they even board train haul turkish jew to auschwitz for extermination and succeed in get them off the train most of the foreign jew be sent to a concentration camp at a place call drancy in paris and where most of the intercession by turkish consul take place the great problem come with the turkish jew who have abandon their turkish citizenship and have become french citizen the consul declare that these people be turkish citizen because they be not my book include photograph of jew line up in front of the turkish consulate either to get passport to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship this be a bureaucratic matter so processing the application would take some time in the meantime it be a real emergency because the nazi would arrest jew on the street for almost nothing the nazi would even arrest them if they have radio or telephone in their apartment because radio and telephone be forbidden to jew to take care of these former turkish jew the turkish diplomat invent a document call gayri muntazem vatandash or    irregular fellow citizen    the document say in effect    this person be a former turkish citizen who have apply for the restoration of his turkish citizenship in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him a if he be a turkish citizen    the diplomat write the document in turkish and put their seal on it since the nazi could not read turkish on the whole they accepted these paper a certificate of citizenship by this mean the turkish diplomat be able to rescue many jew who have relinquish their turkish citizenship actually the nazi be of two mind about the turkish defense of jew on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry which want to retain the friendship of turkey be in favor of accept these intervention on the other hand himmler and eichmann want all jew exterminate at time himmler and eichmann be able to prevail and some of the turkish jew be sent off to auschwitz before the turkish consul could do anything do you have statistic on how many turkish jew be rescue there be about 20 000 turkish jew in europe before world war ii about 10 000 of whom be living in france most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in france i have publish the letter that the turkish consul sent to the nazi official and the letter that come back in reply generally the nazi say that if the turkish consul would present document certify that arrest individual be turkish citizen and promise to send them out of france the nazi would release them from the concentration camp the turkish consul also organize special train to take turkish jew from nazi occupied territory back to turkey these train ran regularly in 1943 and 1944  the nazi give the turkish jew visa so they could pas out of nazi territory but the train be often held up by the nazi influenced government of eastern europe croatia serbia and bulgaria because these government really want the jew to escape a a result of the turkish consul effort about 3 000 to 4 000 of the turkish jew in france be save another 3 000 be sent off to auschwitz where most of them die the remain 3 000 either escape across the border into spain or flee to the area of southern france occupy by the italian who treat jew much well than the nazi do at the end of 1943 however italy fell out of the war and that be the end for those jew a well incidentally the turkish diplomat in nazi occupied greece also work to rescue jew in that country the second part of your book then deal with turkish diplomat act to rescue jew of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution yes and there be an aside i might add here in their intervention on behalf of turkish jew the turk cite their treaty with germany which state that turkish citizen in german territory would be treat the same a german citizen in turkey on that basis the turk maintain that the nazi could not discriminate against turkish citizen who be jew the nazi claimed and the vichy government agree that they be not discriminate because they be treat all jew equally turkey protest say    you be divide our citizen accord to religion but the turkish constitution require that all citizen be treat equally regardless of religion therefore you can not single out turkish jew    american consul in paris by contrast accepted the nazi argument and told american jew who be be persecute by the nazi that they do anything about it because the american jew be be treat the same a other jew the third part of the book take place in turkey which be the principal center during the holocaust for activity aim at the rescue of eastern european jew the kwish agency an organization establish by jew in palestine to help resettle jew to palestine set up an office in istanbul in 1940 under the leadership of chaim barlas other jewish organization in palestine especially the kibbutz also sent representative to istanbul to set up headquarters these group first try to contact jew in eastern europe to find out what be happen today we know about the holocaust but at that time people know what be go on they imagine the nazi could do the thing they be do and so the first step be to get information and the turkish government let them use the turkish mail to send letter to their relative and friend in eastern europe the jewish organization found out what be happen when they receive reply later on when the nazi begin to intercept such letter the jew receive assistance also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who serve a the vatican representative in istanbul from 1935 to 1944 and later become pope john xxiii a the vatican representative during the war he use the facility of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government be do to assist jewish agency in contact jew in eastern europe with the cooperation of the turkish government these agency then sent hard currency food clothing and even railroad and steamship ticket to jew in czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary they able to help much in poland because by then the nazi have wipe out almost all the polish jew whenever possible the rescue agency arrange for the jew to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so call orient express route to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul turkey be not eager for all these refugee to remain within it border during the war because it be be blockade and be suffer terrible shortage of food and clothing the government therefore facilitate the movement of the non turkish jewish refugee from turkey to palestine either by the taurus express railroad through the mountain to syria and palestine or by small boat across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine these effort be bitterly oppose not only by the nazi but also by the british who do not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they fear it would hurt their relation with the arab the british constantly pressure the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jew back in a few case the turkish government yield to british pressure do send the boat back for example in one incident the steamship struma with some 700 jewish refugee from romania be sent back by the turkish government a a result of the intervention of the british ambassador when that ship be sunk by a soviet submarine all be lose except one person nevertheless all told the turkish government allow no few than 100 000 eastern european jew to pas through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war the turkish authority also provide these refugee with facility and money and give them permission to send money and food out of the country many of these jew who pass through turkey may still be living in israel yes and their child but let  s return for a moment to the first group the turkish jew who come from europe they do not go on to palestine they stayed in turkey it be the non turkish eastern european jew who pass through turkey en route to palestine their story be very interest and you have rescue it from obscurity many study have be make of the holocaust but most of them do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jew most of the scholarship have center on the western european jew of whom 6 million be massacre by the nazi my study deal with a much small number of people i have try to round out the picture and i hope my book will persuade other scholar to undertake far investigation in the history of eastern jew when it come to number the german jew be also relatively small in number most of the million slain be polish jew the rescue of 100 000 eastern european jew may not seem so significant compare with the total of 6 million who be murder but it meant a lot to those who be save about three fourths of the book consists of document translation of many document they be include because the story be not well know not only be people in the west unaware of the courageous action of the turkish diplomat

        oooh     now that hurt i will not suffer you through more naive and one sided view of mine please skip my article in the future oh wise tim and have a good day
 soner yamen respond to article 1r20kr m9q nic umass edu burak ucsvax afs just a quick comment afs afs armenian kill turk          turk kill armenian afs afs simple a that can anybody deny these fact jew kill german in wwii    german kill jew in wwii but there be quite a difference in these two statement regardless of what nazi revisionist say sy my grand parent be living partly in today armenia and partly in sy today georgia there be village kurd turk different turkic group sy georgian muslim christian armenian and farsi     very near to eachother sy the people living there be aware of their difference they be sy different people for example my grandfather would not have be happy sy if his doughter have will to marry an armenian guy but that do not sy mean that they be willing to kill eachother no they be neighbor ok  sy armenian kill turk which armenian their neoghbors a far a my sy grandparent be concerned the armenian attack first but these sy armenian be not their neighbor they come from other place maybe sy first they have a training at some place they be taught to kill people sy to hate turks kurds it seem so     there be certainly a difference between the plan extermination of the armenian of eastern turkey begin in 1915 with that of the armeno  georgian conflict of late 1918 the argument be not whether armenian ever kill in their collective existence but rather the wholesale destruction of anatolian armenian under order of the turkish government an armenian  georgian dispute over the disposition of akhalkalak lori and pambak after the turkish third army evacuate the region can not be equate with the extermination of anatolian armenian many armenian and georgian die in this area in the scramble to re occupy these land and the lack of preparation for the winter month this be not the same a the turkish genocide of the armenian nearly four year earlier hundred of kilometer away sy anyway but after they killed raped      turk and other muslim people sy around people assume that  armenians kill u rap our woman sy not a particular group of people train in some camp maybe back sy by some powerful state     after that step you can not explain these sy people not to hate all armenian i follow perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light sy so what be i try to point out first at least for that region sy you can not blame turks kurds etc since it be a self defense situation sy most of the armenian i think be not to blame either but since some sy people start that fire it be not easy to undo it there be fact sy people can not trust eachother easily it be very difficult to establish sy a good relation base on mutual respect and trust between nation with sy different ethnic cultural religious background but it be unfortunately sy very easy to start a fire again the fight between armenian and georgian in 1918 19 have little to do with the destruction of the armenian in turkey it be interest that the georgian leader of the transcaucasian federation armenia azerbaijan and georgia make special deal with turkish general not to pas through tiflis on their way to baku in return for georgian not help the armenian militarily of course a turkish troop march across what be left of caucasian armenia many armenian go north and such population movement cause problem with the local this be in no comparison with event 4 year earlier in eastern anatolia my father  s mother  s family escape cemiskezek erzinka erzerum nakhitchevan tiflis constantinople massachusetts sy my grandparent be  not  bloodthirsty people we do not experience sy what they have to endure     they have to leave their land there be sy lady old lady all of her child kill while she force to sy witness young woman put dirt at their face to make themselves sy unattractive i want to go into any graphic detail my grandmother  s brother be force to dress up a a kurdish woman and paste potato skin on his face to look ugly the turk would kill any armenian young man on sight in dersim because their family be rather influential local kurd help them escape before it be too late this be why i be alive today sy you may think that my source be bias they be bias in some sense sy they experienced their own pain of course that be the way it be but sy a i say they be living in peace with their neighbor before why sy should they become enemy

 from center for policy research cpr subject symbiotics zionism antisemitism zionism and the holocaust                                        by haim bresheeth the first point to note regard the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda be that zionism without anti semitism be impossible zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti semitism namely that jew can not live with non  jew the history and root of the holocaust go back a long way while the industru of death and destruction do not operate before 1942 it root be firmly place in the 19th century jewish aspiration for emancipation emerge out of the national struggle in europe when the hope for liberation through bourgeois democratic change be dash other alternative for improve the lot of the jew of europe achieve prominence the socialist bund a mass movement with enormous follow have to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political zionist in outline these two offer diametrically oppose option for jew in europe while the bund be suggest join force with the rest of europe  s worker the zionist be propose a new programme aim at rid europe of it jew by set up some form of a jewish state historically nothing be inevitable all depends on the balance of force involve in the struggle history can be see a an option tree every time a certain option be chosen other route become bar because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice be make be impossible while zionism a an option be take by many young jew it remain a minority position until the first day of the 3rd reich the zionist federation of germany zvfd an organisation represent a tiny minority of german jew be select by the nazi a the body to represent the jew of the reich it be the only flag of an interantional organisation allow to fly in berlin and this be the only international organisation allow to operate during this period from a marginal position the leader of the zionist federation be propel to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them all of a sudden they attain political power power base not on representation but from be select a the choice of the nazi regime for deal with the the  jewish problem their position in negotiate with the nazi agreement that affected the life of many ten of thousand of the jew in germany transform them from a utopian marginal organisation in germany and some other country in europe into a real option to be consider by german jew the best example of this be the  transfer agreement of 1934  immediately after the nazi takeover in 1933 jew all over the world support or be organise a world wide boycott of german good this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authority search frantically for a way disable the boycott it be clear that if jew and jewish organisation be to pull out the campaign would collapse this problem be solve by the zvfd a letter sent to the nazi party a early a 21  june 1933 outline the degree of agreement that exist between the two organisation on the question of race nation and the nature of the  jewish problem and it offer to collaborate with the new regime    the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jew abroad against the german development boycott propaganda such a be currently be carry out against germany in many way be in essence unzionist because zionism want not to do battle but to convince and build    in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the zionist organisation manage to undermine the boycott the main public act be the signature of the    transfer agreement    with the nazi authority during the zionist congress of 1934  in essence the agreement be design to get germany  s jew out of the country and into mandate palestine it provide a possibility for jew to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of german good to palestine this right be deny to jew leave to any other destination the zionist organisation be the act agent through it financial organisation this agreement operate on a number of front  helping jew to leave the country break the ring of the boycott export german good in large quantity to palestine and last but not least enable the regime to be see a humane and reasonable even towards it avow enemy the jew after all they argue the jew do not belong in europe and now the jew come and agree with them after news of the agreement broke the boycott be doom if the zionist organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the nazi and import their good who could argue for a boycott this be not the first time that the interest of both movement be present to the german public a complementary baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish department of the s later follow by eichmann be invite to travel to palestine this he do in early 1933 in the company of a zionist leader kurt tuchler have spent six month in palestine he write a series of favourable article in der sturmer describe the  new jew of zionism a jew nazi could accept and understand this little known episode establish quite clearly the relationship during the early day of nazism between the new regime and the zvfd a relationship that be echoed later in a number of key instance even after the nature of the final solution become clear in many case this meant a silence of report about the horror of the extermination a book concentrate on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust be post ugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust by s  b  beth zvi in the case of the kastner episode around which jim allen  s play perdition be base even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of event do not exist it occur near the end of the war the ussr have advanced almost up to germany italy and the african base have be lose the nazi be on the run with a number of key country such a rumania leave the axis a second front be a matter of month away a the western ally prepared their force in the midst of all this we find eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder set up his hz in occupy budapest after the german takeover of the country in april 1944  his first act be to have a conference with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist federation member head by kastner a the agent and clearing house for all jew and their relationship with the s and the nazr authority why they do this be not difficult to see a oppose to poland where it three and a half million jew live in ghetto and be visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jew be an integrate part of the community the middle class be mainly jewish the jew be mainly middle class they enjoy freedom of travel serve in the hungarian fascist army in fronline unit a officer and soldier their name be hungarian how be eichmann to find them if they be to be exterminate the task be not easy there be a million jew in hungary most of them resident the rest be refugee from other country many have heard about the fate of jew elsewhere and be unlikely to believe any statement by nazi official like elsewhere the only people who have the information and the ear of the frighten jewish population be the judenrat in this case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation member without their help the s with 19 officer and less than 90 men plus a few hundred hungarian police could not have collect and control a million jew when they do not even know their whereabouts kastner and the others be left under no illusion eichmann told joel brand one of the member of kastner s committee that he intend to send all hungary  s jew to auschwitz before he even start the expulsion he told them clearly that all these jew will die 12 000 a day unless certain condition be met the committee face a simple choice to tell the jew of hungary about their fate with neutral rumania where many could escape be in most case a few hour away or to collaborate with the nazi by assist in the concentration process what would not have be believe when come from the s sound quite plausible when come from the mouth of the zionist leadership thus it be that most of the hungarian jew go quietly to their death assure by their leadership that they be to be sent to work camp to be sure there be thirty piece of silver in this narrative of destruction the train of  prominents which eichmann promise to kastner a promise he kept to the last detail for eichmann it be a bargain allow 1 680 jew to survive a the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jew there be no way in which the jew of hungary could even be locate not to say murder without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friend no doubt the s would hunt a few jew here and there but the scale of the operation would have be miniscule compare to the half million who die in auschwitz it be important to realise that kastner be not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner act a a result of his strongly held zionist conviction his action be a logical outcome of earlier position this be instanced when he expose to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteur palgi and senesh and persuade them to give themselves up so a not to disrupt his operation at no point during his trial or elsewhere do kastner deny that he knew exactly what be to happen to those jew

 you apparently think you be some sort of one man judge and jury who can declare    total    victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause but picked the wrong topic if you think a few rig    quotation    can sustain the legend and lie of the deir yassin    massacre    you have a lot to learn when it come to historical methodology at the most basic level you should know that there be a big difference between weigh evidence fairly and merely find    quotation    that support your preset opinion if you have study the history of israel at all you must know that many of the source of your    quotation    have an axe to grind and therefore you must be very careful about whom you    quote    for example meir pa il whom you cite be indeed a general a scholar and a war hero but that mean everything that come out of his mouth be gold in fact and here your lack of experience show pa il be such a fanatic embitter leftist that much of his anti israel blathering forget about anti irgun blathering would be consider something like treason in non israel context but of course you consider this at all when you find a juicy    quotation    that you can use to attack israel benny morris of hashomer hatzair represent himself a a    scholar    when he rehash the old attack on the irgun be fool just the old zionist ideological catfight surface a an attack on the then  likud government if you will look closely at the section on deir yassin in his book on the war of independence you will see his    indictment    to be pure hot air and this be the best he can do after decade of dig for any sort of damn evidence unfortunately for him because his book parade itself a    scholarly    he be force to put footnote so you can clearly see that his deir yassin account be base on nothing the deir yassin    massacre    never take place a the propagandist tell it any more than the sabra and shatila    massacre    do you get the feel people like to blame the jew for    massacre    even if they have to make them up it must sound spicy even some jew like to do it for reason of their own please confuse any of you deir yassin    massacre    stuff with fact or scholarship you should stick to begin  s version unless you find something serious to contradict it

 some of your article be cut off on the right margin but i will try and answer from what i can read judaism do not father islam we have many of the same prophet but judaism ignores prophet later prophet include jesus christ who christian and muslim believe in and mohammed the idea of believe in one god should unite all people however note that christianity and islam reflect the fact that there be people with different view and the right of non christians and non muslims be state in each religion we be suppose to pay 6 of our income after all necessity be paid please note that this 6 be on a personal basis if you be poor there be no need to pay quite the contrary this money most often go to the poor in each in country and to the poor muslim around the world also this money be not require in the human sense i e a muslim never knock at your door to ask for money and nobody make a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid and we surely pas money basket around during our prayer service god  s presence be certainly on earth but since god be everywhere god may show sign of existence in other place a well we can not say for sure where god have show sign of his existence and where he have not  the qur an be not a copyright of the taurah muslim believe that the taurah the bible and the qur an originally contain much the same message thus the many similiarities however the taurah and the bible have be  translated into other language which have change their meaning over time a translation also reflect some of the personal view of the translator s the qur an still exists in the same language that it be reveal in arabic therefore we know that mankind have not change it meaning it be truly what be reveal to mohammed at that time there be many scientific fact which be not discover by traditional scientific method until much later such a the development of the baby in the mother  s womb only god know for sure how it will turn out i hope it but if that happens it be the will of god please send this mail to me again so i can read the rest of what you say and yes may god help u all

 i would like to share with netters a few point i picked up from the pb frontline program regard iran  s nuclear activity air on tuesday april 13  for the sake of brevity i  ll present them in some separate point 1  a many other western program this program be laid on a bed of misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the program on the viewer some of the misinformation be a follow it be allege that    late imam khomeini object to shah  s technological advancement a anti islamic but now thing have change and the proof of change be that some iranian merchant be now sell personal computer    these be the most ridiculous lie one can make about the objective of the islamic revolution in topple the shah and state of the technology in iran after revolution  iran be equally accuse of use chemical weapon against iraqi aggressor while there have never be any proof in this regard and nobody have see iraqi soldier or civilian injured by iranian chemical weapon in contrary to what the whole world have see about iranian soldier and civilian injured by iraqi chemical weapon while the number of martyr during the sacred defense against iraqi aggression have be officially announce to be about 117 000 and even most radical counter revolutionary group claim that iran and iraq have a total of one million dead this program claim that iran alone have one million dead left from the war the translation of iranian official talk be not 100 true for example when iranian head of atomic energy say that    it hurt me to see that iran be the subject of these unfriendly propaganda    the research     2  almost all allege device or material bought or plan to be bought by iranian be of countless dual usage while the program try to undermine their non military us without any reference to iran s big population and it inevitable need to other source of energy in near future and it current deficit in electrical power 3  the whole program be try to show the sharif university of technology a a nuclear research center while even the cameraman of the program know well that in a country like iran without a so tightly close society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university take in account the scientific advancement of sharif u  in engineering field and it potential role in improvement of iran  s industry and eventually the life of people it be obvious that they be persuade other country to prevent them from far help this university or other one in scientific and industrial effort 4  a key point in program  s justification be try to disvalidate a much a possible all effort do by iaea in their numerous visit from iran  s different site they say    we be not sure if the place visit by iaea be the real one or not    or    we can not rely on iaea s report and observation because they fail to see iraq  s nuclear activity before    a if they know that iraq be try to build nuclear weapon 5  a an extremely personal opinion the most disgust aspect of the program be the arrogance of the member of u senate foreign affair william triplet in his way of talk a if he be the god talk from the absolute knowledge i hope all iranian be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western medium and i hope iranian authority continue to their wise and calculate approach with regard to international affair and peaceful coexistence with friendly nation mohammad
