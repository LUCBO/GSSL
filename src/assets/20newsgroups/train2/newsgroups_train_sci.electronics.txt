 firstly i would never consider try to make a one shot timer your 2f2 cap will have be design a a ram battery substitute rather than for use in application where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their performance in some respect be more akin to battery than to a normal cap the other point be that big electro  s be usually rat with  5  20 tolerance so calculate exactly what capacitance you have particularly when consider the cold you should be look at design a micropower oscillator and divider chain that    roll over    from zero to maximum count or vice versa once every 1 209 600 second if you be to use something like a 110hz clock you would need a divider chain of 2 27 to give an error of less than one percent in the fire time over the six week period of course you could trim the 110hz oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remain exactly constant at  40 be low anyway i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in fire the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit caveat not experienced in low temperature electronics so i guarantee that this or any other approach be the best for inhospitable condition johnh                                                                                                                    _  _  _  _  electronics department  _  _  _  _      school of mpce                                                     macquarie university sydney australia 2109 email johnh mpce mq edu au ph  61 2 805 8959 fax  61 2 805 8983
 good point     also i be surprised that the component they use off shore be of inferior quality a long a it be properly design and robust premium component be use it matter where it be assemble an amp that run hot have no bearing on how gon na sound the amp you have probably be run class a the whole day actually be wary of excessively hot amp  cauz even though the component inside may be rat to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of  any  electronic component regardless of quality in fact an amp that do run hot to the touch be because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp want to skimp on heatsinking or cool to save cost hmmmmm     aaron
 why be you fooling around with analog for this job a single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily an 8748 only cost about 5 that and a 1 crystal and in business embed the whole thing in a foam insulate blanket power it from a solar cell use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness if you want to try thermal management contact someone like icl and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal it  ll cost at most 20 if you use a single chip micro look at a part count of maybe 7  a processor a crystal two cap on the crystal a power fet to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery this be few part than you can build an analog timer for and be infinitely more reliable add a power zener diode for heat and a solar cell and the part count scream up to 9  pd assembler be available for all the common single chip micros this application be so trivial you could even look up the op code in the programmer  s guide and create the binary with a hex editor john
 anyway over the weekend i be rest on the sofa in between chore and notice that i briefly picked up what sound like ham radio traffic over my stereo and television even though both be off also all the touch sensitive light in my house start go wacko cycling through their four brightness state i presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past my house i live on a busy thoroughfare would this be a correct presumption what kind of power must he be put out to cause the effect the affected equipment be about 100 foot from the road     ham be unlikely to have an illegal amp and be also unlikely to have a    dirty    amp ham can legally run up to 1500 watt it be very unlikely however that a ham would be run that kind of power from a car ham rig not possible either need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier i can just see it you need to slow down on a downgrade so you hit the push to talk button for car put out around 100 watt it be possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 foot away most tv stereo and vcr have very poor rf shield if you experience the problem frequently it may be cause by a ham cber or other radio operator in a base station nearby the interference may have be cause by a radio transmitter use for other purpose such a police fire etc if you heard voice over your stereo i think you be correct in assume that the source be an rf transmitter if you have frequent trouble you may want to try the rf ferrite choke available at radio shack the interference be probably be picked up by your speaker wire and those choke can be instal on the wire very easily without cut them good instruction be include with the choke if that do not solve the problem you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator look for antenna on the roof or car talk to him her about your problem there be thing a radio operator can do to reduce interference and please remember to be friendly when approach your local radio operator this person may or may not be the cause of your trouble and get well cooperation and help if you assume that he be go to be helpful most be it be amaze the accusation that we sometimes dealt with a i grow up we be blame for skip ghost picture on the tv that occur at sunspot peak c b interferance dead grass you name it btw the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she be directly responsible it be part of be a good neighbor and that be how the fcc view it too bad they require the consumer equipment maker to take any precaution last you can usually tell ham radio vs  cb ham operator be require to declare their call sign every so many minute no more than 10 so if you hear    this be wa1qt    or some other call start with a w or k and no more than 6 total character you heard a ham cb ers probably sign i know that even require to and fire police have other private id
 michael fulbright say    analog switches balanced    to all on 04 15 93 01 08 mf i be try to build a synchronous demodulator and hit a snag mf in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an mf op amp amplifier from 1 to  1 controlable via a digital input mf the most obvious way come up with be to use analog switch mf to adjust the gain of the op amp the only analog switch i have mf experience with it the 4066  unfortunately i want to switch an mf ac signal which go from about  5v to 5v and the 4066 be only mf for positive signal how about use a 4053 it have a seperate ground for the analog output it would get you 3 bit mf another part which caught my eye be the analog device ad630 this mf be a balance demodulator which appear to fill exactly the need i mf have the data sheet be somewhat skimpy on application note could mf someone comment on use this chip for the follow application or how about a multiply d a convertor this be essentiallty what you be make stephen cyberman toz buffalo ny us mangle on fri 04 16 1993 at 13 36 11     catch the blue wave

 early pa i recall reading of a phonograph which use mechanical amplification compress air be squirt out of a valve which be control by the pickup the result be noisy and distinctly lo fi but much louder than a conventional phonograph it tend to wear the disk out pretty quickly though an now deceased prof told u willing student about a project he have work on during wwii they need a mega power pa with very clear audio quality the purpose be to bellow at refugee from aircraft their solution be a giant compressed air source and a horn with parallel shutter work by a small audio system i think he say it work very well thus the war dept cancel the project

 here  s a question for all you electrical engineer out there i bought an  infrared detector module at radio shack for 3 95 it be a little gizmo that sens infrared remote and produce an output signal then i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared lead the circuit work like a minature remote control extender in my car all remote command be relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment it work fine with my denon cd player but when i try to build the same circuit for a friend s vcr it work the circuit appear to work for other remote you can see infrared with a sony ccd camcorder but coincidentally it only seem to work for my cd player     any advice would be appreciate     brian
 this may sound like a simple minded question but this be the first time ever have a need for this be design some relatively simple chip circuit base on thing like photoresistors you know no light to photoresistor emit a logic high etc  anyway get some servo lie around and i want to do some thing with them use digital logic i know all about have to pulse the signal and everything i just have one problem assume i need a negative yes negative logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high be a negative logic high see this in schematic the same thing a an active low or what not use a bi polar power source so how would i get a negative logic high out of this thing i need to have all three signal available logic high logic low and negative logic high any help would be greatly appreciate also please reply via email a i never seem to have time to read this or any other group lately thanks much  mark
 yes but in a fairly reproducible way  40 be only a smidgen of the distance to absolute zero and in any case go to have to borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test calibrate this darling anyway btw probably go to want those big capacitor you found to fire the solenoid    high current drain on frozen battery can be an ugly thing
 i miss the first article s on this line due to not have a chance to read the news for a couple of day     the idea be commercialize in at least one product the private eye a small cube shaped device that the user strap around the head similar to a sweat band there be a boom that come from the side on which the device be mount so that it be position in front of the user  s eye the private eye we have here for evaluation be hercules mda compatible the innards be a row  400 led that be swept up and down by a galvonometer like movement the result be that the sweep lead bar form a fuse raster there be a virtual image project in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background i like the device very much i found it easy to use if i look at a blank white wall i have problem with focus track if i glance down to look at my keyboard for an out of the way key the unit also emit a soft buzz and vibration which i found annoy some people seem to mind the buzz properly use however the image clarity be quite crisp i know if the company have take the technology any far in the last year or two but it do seem to have promise

 just a suggestion take a motorola mc14536b set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten sec with either a rc or xtal clock input then feed to a mc14521b a clock input and decode output for 1 209 600 sec output might have to add a few  and  gate or decoder chip to get output and reset pulse back to the 521 to restart cycle     trigger a oneshot from the decode rise edge the one shot then go to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher   these ckts require uamps of current between 5 15 volt so a 12 volt gel cell of a few amphours would last the six week then take the ckt board battery wrap in 3    or 4    of foam or build a box of out of the stuff     with plywood or metal exterior     build a small heater out of 10 50 watt resistor in series to keep the battery and ckts warm 2nd thought use 2 battery one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger insolate insolate          even though the chip state that the al rat device be good to  55 c   the battery have a considerable reduction in capacity     oh make sure the area inside have minium air leakage   hope this help rw be this to long wind for the net be gentle

 i be try to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs  a blank screen by monitoring the r g and b output of a graphic card it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 mhz which would mean detect a 15 n pulse it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about 300 mv and a dim screen say around 310 mv oh yes it also need to be cheap my first circuit be a dismal failure i use 3 compariators each compariator have the input go to one of the gun the input go to a reference create by a voltage divider a potentiometer the first problem be that the compariator be way too slow   i need to get several pixel in a row before it would fire the compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my circuit would not detect it the second problem be that there be more noise on the reference then the small difference between a blank screen and a dim screen in fact the difference between completely black and completely white be only 650 mv i be wonder if i be go to have to amplify the video signal to make this work there be faster compariators but they be expensive and require split supply i would need to replace my  49 quad compariator with three 1 89 compariators and create a whole new power supply circuit at this point i think what i need be some sort of transistor circuit transistor be fast and cheap and should do the trick     unfortunately i be way out of my league when it come to design transistor circuit so i be appeal to the net for help any idea tip circuit pointer reference etc would be greatly appreciate oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so i need a fast response time at all however i found a way to take advantage of that fact thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course you will have my undying gratitude steve verity
 careful now folk     also consider the 90vac  20hz that be force on ring and tip when the phone  s suppose to ring even with a simple zener and lead setup you might end up with some carbon real quick whatever scheme you use make sure get at least 200v rated component on the frontend also remember that if not mistaken the phone line be a 600ohm equivalent circuit any current you draw from the 48v or so get drop across that 600ohms fine until down to roughly 12v when ma bell considers it to be off hook but drop it that far down be probably a big no no the easy implementation to accomplish the above tip                                                     rectifier resistor diode v zener       resistor v lead    ring                                                       this be only a suggestion     go ahead and blow hole in it but you get the idea choose a high efficiency lead so you need much current to get it to light up choose value for the other component a require

 i bother with the copy protection if i be you if you program be any good the pirate will have strip the protection and will be distribute the strip version be well under a week hardware method prevent j  random loser from use his copy ii pc to pirate your software but stop anyone who know a few people with enough connection to    real    pirate who _will_ be able to defeat your    check for the hole    code you may want to price your software depend on what it be a tad high     a price change from 15 to 25 probably would turn off very few potential buyer and that way you could tolerate more pirate whose number change with the price a for the 20 pirate figure     ha ha of course a lot of pirate just have this    thing    about have pirate software even if they never use it so perhaps that really count towards 20 even so 20 be awfully low     joel kolstad

 hello let me introduce a problem when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter use ac mode my output be an rms value a peak value over 2 square right when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac my output be equal to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave i assume that a digital voltmeter make some kind of integration of the input value and divide it over the wave period right now i use it to measure the same square wave a above but distort by high frequency harmonic ideally output should be the same but     the output value be only about 10 of the previous one why what be the nature of this output value what do the voltmeter actually measure and what do it show re rms reading unless the dvm  says  measure rms probably average voltage the input be diode rectify and measure a dc if it say rms and but measure square triangle etc incorrectly measure average and multipling by a correction  only  true for sine wave i e vave  0 707 0 63 vrms if you want correct rms for most any waveform you need a    true rms    dvm dmm which literally do the root mean square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry related question less important to me what be advantage and disadvantage of digital voltmeter to compare with analog one the last significant advantage of analog imo    be    be able to    see    the signal if it be change over time e g check electrolytic capacitor anymore most dmm have bargraphs etc that duplicate this thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at avm1993 zeus tamu edu or open a discussion here i would appreciate either way alexander v  mamishev ____________________________________________________________________________ power system automation laboratory phone office 409 845 4623 department of electrical engineering phone home 409 846 5850 texas a m university fax 409 862 2282 college station tx 77843 usa internet avm1993 zeus tamu edu

 detector be legal in alberta the old law be overturn a long time ago
 my next project be to come up with an if detector module for fast    112 to 250 kb sec    packet radio use no fancy modulation scheme just wide fsk for use at 902 or 1296 mhz a bit familiar with the motorola 3362 chip but i wonder if there be newer design that might work at high input frequency my goal be to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver    back end    with if input on one end and an fsk demondulator on the other particularly interested in way to use a high if than 10 7    do any current chip work up to say 150mhz with internal downconversion so a normal if filter can be use any suggestion john what you describe be very close to what i built and described in the 10th arrl computer network conference proceeding i built 10 watt fsk transceivers at 904 mhz they be essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 mhz the receiver us the mc13055 which be the same fsk receiver chip i use previouslyu in the 2 mbps 10 ghz data link i first publish in ham radio and which be now also in the arrl handbook the mc3356 which include a vhf converter section could also be use at these speed there be a newer and perhaps slightly improve design of this the mc13056 if i remember rightly while use this would have let me reduce the    external    if count on receive it really offer all that much help on transmit so i bother with it the radio i built be first design and built for 512 kbps in a 2 mhz channel but later reduce to half that these 256 kbps radio actually have do quite well in across the bench test at 384 kbps and speed be pretty much a function of filter design handle the data stream be another matter entirely some of the exist radio be currently deployed on hilltop in a    beacon    test mode while there be not yet end end two way data flow due to lack of resource to debug software for the digital hardware mio also show in the cnc proceeding data be perfect copy at n6gn even though the data clock be currently at about half speed the a 2  kbytes of the test text chapter 55 of isaiah take only a little over 1 8 of a second be hop that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involve in write code to make the whole thing usable borland ide environment with remote debug possible a mention in the proceeding but to date a couple of u have be on our own and run low on resource of time money and energy if anyone in the sf bay area want to check it out there be also a cw id after the text on the mark side at 904 740 mhz from beacon on sonoma mtn and black mtn overlook si valley the antenna be horizontally polarize i guess in retrospect my suggestion be that this be a fairly costly approach if the radio be intend for user rather than backbone and you might want to carefully consider your    target    if you arrange your path such that you have complete line of sight i think want to address the inter symbol interference cause by multipath and probably link c n budget if path be very far from los for more detail see the 10th cnc currently work on a spread spectrum direct conversion design to address some of these problem be glad to help a i can with any design problem 73 glenn elmore n6gn

 one thing to consider be time division multiplexing the emg channel to reduce the number of rf carrier you have to generate if you multiplexed the emg input at 10khz that would probably be sufficient for most physiology study have 330 hz per channel sample rate that level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish combine a lot of rf carrier be pretty tricky to do without generate intermodulation a system to be carry by a runner be in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balance a commercial hand held transciever could probably be employ with a little modification to accomodate widen the bandwidth obviously this have to be do in accordance with whatever law govern the use of transeivers in your location

 1 output offset obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope and adjust the internal output offset contorl there be virtual certainty that there be an internal ajustment for the offset control  s zero detent position 2 verify that the function generator be properly load many generator expect you to supply a 50 ohm load go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass through 50 ohm terminator that have a male and female bnc or whatever connector on it the calibrator on my tektronix scope be design to put out  4v into a 1 meg load but  1 volt into a 50 ohm load you may also find that load the output of the function generator also reduces the harmonic distortion build an attenuator you have to use and i want to use the input impedance of the device under test a part of the voltage divider to drop the input test voltage consider this          10k                         ohm       gen 50 ohm d u t load                                                       think about the ratio of 50 10k and then think about the accuracy to which you can read voltage on your oscilloscope you can virtually discount the load of the d u t also you have the millivolt test generator you want good luck
 fyi the actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an hp deskjet be 1 600th inch the electronics and dynamic of the ink cartridge however limit you to generate dot at 300 per inch on almost any paper the ink wick more than 1 300th inch anyway the method of deposit and fuse toner of a laster printer result in much less spread than ink drop technology it take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer be more complex than inexpensive ink jet printer recall also that laser printer offer a much high throughput 10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer something else to think about be the cost of consumables over the life of the printer a 3000 page yield toner cartridge be about u 75 80 at discount while hp high capacity  500 1000 page yield cartridge be about u 22 at discount it could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printer be less than ink jet printer it be get progressively closer between the two technology laser printer be usually desinged for high duty cycle in page per month and longer product replacement cycle

 i would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which be output from a thermocouple preferably by a factor of 100 or 1000       so that the result voltage can be fed more easily into a personal computer based adc data acquisition card might anyone be able to point me to reference to such circuit i have see simple amplifier circuit before but i be not sure how well they work in practice in this case like something which will amplify sufficiently    nicely    to be use for thermocouple say a few degree accuracy or well
 actually fossil fuel plant run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plant there  s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power us 1900 vintage steam technology so more important in nuclear plant to get the cold end of the system a cold a possible hence big cool tower oil and gas fire steam plant also have condenser but they usually be size to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plant do cool the condenser with water rather than air a one canadian official ask about    thermal pollution    de icing a river say    up here we view heat a a resource    everybody run closed cycle boiler the water use be purify of solid which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boil purify water for boiler use be a big job than cool it so the boiler water be recycle

 assume 68hc11     in expand muxed mode you  could  do it much easy if you get a dram controller ic the mmi 673102 could be use to implement this or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row column refresh address multiplexing the thing with dram be that they require wierd timing address multiplexing and refresh actually if you want to use a 68008 ic you could look at an897 which have a neat controller built in there be also the 683xx i think one of those have the dram controller built in this one be for the 6664 dram however the 41256 have only one more address line add only another component or so the 256k simms be basically 8 or 9 41256 dram chip or their equivalent in few package

 try comp dcom i be reading a thread a while back about an 800 number that you could dial work here it be a sale line for sprint i think tell you that you could have all your customer number use there ani then it told you your number should work with any modern switch mycal
 look at the 4053  this be a triple 2 to 1 transmission gate analog multiplexer with positive and negative power supply can be run from a single ended supply a well with dual supply the logic input still range from ground 0 volt to vdd this be a neat well i think so design for a switchable polarity amplifier                                          input                       opamp                output                                  control              x analog switch    gnd all resistor be equal value when the analog switch be close the amp be inverting gain of one with the switch open it be non inverting gain of one you can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurt the balance this would show up a carrier feed through for high frequency the slew rate of the opamp might cause problem especially if it symmetrical and it usually
 yes you increase the rpm slip of a    boxer    type fan by instal a capacitor in series with the fan  s power supply the air flow of small 3 5 inch fan can be reduce by about 50 by use a 1 to 4 uf capacitor use a good grade nonpolarized unit with work voltage rating around 250 volt note that some impriical study be usually require to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a give application for dc power application try the radio shack 12 volt box fan it can run and start reliably from a low a about 4 5 vdc it be exceptionally quiet but at admittedly low flow i wish i knew who make the fan for radio shack
 hi there can anyone tell me where it be possible to purchase control found on most arcade style game many project i be work on would be greatly augment if i could implement them thanx in advance hap control just outside chicago sell these i remember which suburb they be in the price be pretty reasonable and they be easy to hook up i bought a new coin mechanism from them for 25 00 a couple of year ago
 i have notice a lot of electronics question by people who be obviously not    tuned in    to electronics many of them have rather simple answer and many of them require a circuit diagram rather than muck up the network why you write to me send a self  address stamp envelop and i  ll answer your question if i can w  l  willis p  e  114 fern circle clemson sc 29631 because the network be quicker easy and free at least to me                                                                                                                         christopher wolf electrical engineer cmwolf mtu edu
 my next project be to come up with an if detector module for fast    112 to 250 kb sec    packet radio use no fancy modulation scheme just wide fsk for use at 902 or 1296 mhz a bit familiar with the motorola 3362 chip but i wonder if there be newer design that might work at high input frequency my goal be to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver    back end    with if input on one end and an fsk demondulator on the other particularly interested in way to use a high if than 10 7    do any current chip work up to say 150mhz with internal downconversion so a normal if filter can be use any suggestion john

 hi all an assistant manager at a local art theater here in columbus like to expand our show automation a bit  namely add the capability to use cue tape to bring the houselights up our current automation console date from the early 60  s and provide this function we already have the combo failsafe contact roller to read the cuetapes and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when it fade up control circuit 120 vac be momentarily close for at least 0 5 second try wiring the dimmer control to a 12v relay activate when the cue tape completes the circuit low tech and simple but there  s one problem in order to get the 1 2 second pulse there need to be a sh  load of cuetape on the film 35mm run at 90 foot per minute so to get a 1 2 second pulse there need to be at least 9 inch of solid cuetape ideally i would like to use a single cross cue to accomplish this function a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film this would give a pulse of approximately 1 100 of a second what i need be a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1 2 second the ability to adjust how long the relay be activate would be nice i figure this would require an rc circuit of some sort sure some of you already have the solution figure out in your head any suggestion and schematic would be appreciate thanks mark fontana
 the pads  zip file contain subdirectory and have to be unzipped via    pkunzip  d    then an xcopy  s to three floppy creates the disk need to do the install still not sure how this be suppose to work since the  zip file take up about 2 5mb so it must be a tight squeeze on those floppy     however i manage to install pad and pretty impressed i create a couple of schematic without problem but whenever i try to create a pcb layout from one of  my  circuit rather than the demo it work wonder if maybe a file where it should be     can anyone who have a print manual comment on whether the registration fee be worth pay chris
 there be two issue here copyright and patent the magazine article  s content be copyright and may not be reproduce translate etc  without the copyright holder  s permission however this do not cover the  ideas  express only the form of expression copying their circuit diagram or pc board pattern be copyright infringement but unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself be copyright so long a you draw your own diagram and lay out your own board copyright be an issue patent be different the author do  not  have to give you any warn that the design be cover by patent although it would be sensible for him to do so in fact possible that  he  be infringe on someone else  s patent without realize it ignorance of the patent status be not a defence against infringement although it might reduce the damage a court would award however     unless there be something seriously novel about the circuit almost certainly it be    obvious to one skilled in the art    and therefore unpatentable routine engineering be not patentable patent in theory cover only invention idea that be genuinely new caution i be not a lawyer consult a professional would be wise if significant amount of money be at stake
 a quick and dirty way to get high current carry capacity on pc board trace for one  or few of a kind board be to strip some 14 romex house wiring cable to bare copper form the bare copper to follow the trace and solder it down and if not quick and dirty you can get bus bar that be stamp out with lead that insert in the pc board

 the point be that the original poster be talk about connect ground and neutral in the  outlet  box big no no and you be talk about them be connect in the breaker box a thing should be if this be not obvious the point be that there should be current flow in the white i e neutral return wire when thing in the house be operating there should not be any flow in the ground wire unless there be a fault condition notice also that in the breaker box there be a wire lead from the above mentioned junction to earth ground usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground
 i use an h11f1 fet optoisolater to switch microphone level signal there be no click since i put a  1uf cap across the lead distortion measurement be very low with mic level and they go up to 0 03 at a 14 db line level all i do be put the fet in series with one leg of the balance line no hum pop just audio jumping out of silence the fet run about 100 million ohm with the lead dark and drop to 150 200 ohm with it on

 first of all realize that tesla invent ac power generator motor transformer conductor etc technically  all  transformer be tesla coil in general though when someone refers to a tesla coil they mean an    air core resonant transformer    the tv flyback version tesla coil see the _encyclopedia_of_electronic_circuits_ v3 106 1 for diagram have not an air core it be of a class of circuit call    oscillate shuttle circuit    osc generally osc  s be highly efficient but this version us transistor and resistor which be very lossy device typically tesla use active reactance instead of passive resistor so that he could achieve efficiency of 99 5 and well the usual application of an air core resonant transformer or of an osc be to produce strong emi for wireless broadcast how well do you think your computer screen would work if we remove the hf hv tesla flyback coil from it if we be to remove from our home and industry all tesla coil our light would go dark our car would sputter and die our radio would go silent our industry would grind to a halt and we would have to go back to use coal for heat gas for lamp horse for transportation steam for power and telegraph for communication be that real world enough for you get the message we would not have 1 100 the convieniences we have today if not for tesla give credit where credit be due if it have be up to edison still be in the 19th century flame me at your own peril very good at put edison down       et    tesla be 100 year ahead of his time perhaps now his time come

 hi people   ok here my problem     i keep hearing about these little credit card type of thing which detect ir light     i believe that you have to  charge them up under normal visible light and then if they be expose to ir light they glow or something like that     i think that they be avaliable in the state and even in england but ala i live in australia could someone please inform me if i can get these thing over here and if so where and how much also be they really commonly avaliable in the state and if so then how much be they and who sell them maybe if i cant get one here i ll write to one of the company over seas   anyway     thanks in advance
 on december 29 1992 it be illegal to operate a radar detector in the state of virginia if one get caught one get fin 65 00 ask me how i know the federal communication act of 1934 make it  legal  for you to operate a radio receiver of any kind on any frequency include x k and ka band in the united state the electronic communication privacy act of 1989 restrict the fca of 1934 by make it illegal to receive the land mobile telephone service include i believe cellular phone no restriction be place on receive radar or curiously cordless phone enforcement of the virginia law be in violation of the fca of 1934  if you have lot of time and money and a lawyer which  not  you can argue this in a federal court and try to have the law overturn i can hardly wait to see the response to this one but somebody have to say it
 hi i be do research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology paper and i read that one researcher flash hidden message on the tv screen at 1 200ths of a second be that possible i thought the maximum rate the tv be even capable of display image be 1 30th of a second or 1 60th of a second for an image compose of only odd or even scan line
 not even in sub panel the only place the neutral should be connect to the ground be in a service disconnect in your house the    main    panel serf a the service disconnect sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must maintain seperate neutral and ground bus because they be not service disconnect equipment

 while drive through the middle of nowhere i picked up knbr be 1070 a clear channel station base in los angeles they have an ad claim that they be able to get traffic flow information from all of the thousand of traffic sensor that caltrans have place under the pavement do caltrans sell this info do knbr have an exclusive what  s the deal
 it be illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business or for an illegal use jurisdiction that ban radar detector or police monitor be essentially make the claim that there be no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor the result of fight these claim in court have be mixed the federal court be not anxious to intervene and state court have sometimes held that the fed have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not a lot of state court do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoid law enforcement action for speed when you buy a radar detector amongst the guarrantees instruction explanation and other detritus be an invitation to join an association dedicate to preserve your right to use a radar detector i promise i be not make this up i do not think radar detector manufacturer would be make any headway at all in courtroom if police department enforce speed law with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of ticket

 hello    i just bought a new portable cd player for the office and i notice that it proudly proclaims    8 time oversampling    on the box now while i think i understand what oversampling be the rate of discrete    sample    exceeds the high frequency component of interest by some factor i understand this    8 time    business     it seem to me that when i bought my first cd player be it really 10 year ago the spec say    4 time        could someone please tell me whether get senile if not then what good do it do for the player to take sample at a high rate if i really want well fidelity i have to have the same high rate of sample during the record process furthermore be i wrong in interpret the sample rate from the player  s point of view a be the same thing a the data rate for the bit stream come off the optical medium do this mean that the data rate related to the rotational speed of the disk have change since 1983 so confuse        cliff
 actually a bit more complicate than that     i sound to me your ups take in ac rectifies it to dc to charge the battery and then take the battery dc and chop it to ac again feed your equipment this approach be the easy and cleanest way to switchover from the main to battery once your power kick out since a you mention nothing will know about what happen down the line another way to do the ups scheme be to use the main until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with inverter to replace the lose power the problem here be the switchover time and get to resync the ac in no time flat unfortunately most everything be built around the assumption that ac be available so the ups guy have to provide and ac output to be usable     ya sorta have to make it work with what there already similar story with our telephone system it be first invent back in the 1800  s still use the same damn system medium a they do back then if i have a phone from back then i can assure you it  ll work on today  s phone system it cost too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what be out there
 well not too sure if this would be the right place to post this but anyway here go i be just notice that some of the current bubblejet printer offer up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of low end laser printer only offer 300x300 however the laser printer still seem to be significantly pricier than the bubblejet     how be this or be i miss something about the resolution thing
 except for their size the cool tower on nuclear power plant be vertually identical in construction and operation to cool tower design and built in the 1890  s a hundred year ago for coal fire power plant use for light and early electric railway basicly the cylindrical tower support a rapid air draft when it air be heat by hot water and or steam circulate thru a network of pipe that fill about the low 1 3 of the tower to assist cool and the draft water mister be add that spray cold water over the hot pipe the cold water evaporates remove the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the result water vapor be rapidly carry away by the draft this produce the cloud frequently see rise out of these tower that slight pinch maybe 2 3 of the way up the tower be there because it produce a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produce compare to a straight cylinder shape the tower be use to recondense the steam in the seal steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and use again the wider the temperature difference across the turbine use in the power plant the more effecient they be and by recondensing the steam in the cool tower before send it back to the boiler you maintain a very wide temperature difference sometimes a high a 1000 degree or more from first stage    hot    turbine to final stage    cold    turbine r  tim coslet
 hi i be wonder if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related subject i be currently learn about am fm receiver and recieving circuit i understand a lot of thing but a few thing i be confuse abuot the first be the mixer to mix the rf and local oscillator frequency to make the if do anyone have any cicruit diagram a simple a possible for this kind of mixer i have come across a mc sbl mixer chip but i have not be able to find it in any catalog active etc     along the same note be there any simple fm receiver circuit anyone may have stash away somewhere and they couold let me see p s any really good book on am fm theory along with detailed electrical diagram would help a lot i have see a lot of theory book with no circuit and a lot of circuit book with no theory but one without the other do not help thanks
 do anybody out there know how the hand held breathalyzer use by our police work i would like to hear about this and the more general problem of detect smell by machine thanks william williamb ee ubc ca from what i have read about these little gadget it work on a electrochemical galvanic principle the sense unit have a chemical matrix which produce an electrical voltage proportional to the amount of chemical compound it be design for     in this case i believe it be the hydroxyl group i have also heard not test since common gasoline be also a member of this hydroxyl group it will also cause a fail breathalizer failure next time you get stop for duo say you just siphon gas from your neighbor car you know        the oklahoma credit card and chance be you get a duo ticket jerry long
 hi i be look for some help in choose a package for a high speed silicon adc 100mhz currently be fabricate this be a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb i expect to have roughly 100 package circuit and will do dc low speed and high speed test use 3 different set ups for the test chip i know for sure that a dip will not work the long lead line have too high an inductance get a custom made package be too expensive so i be try to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier the flatpack would be hard to test since it have to be solder on to the test setup and i would spend load of time solder a i kept change the test chip the leadless chip carrier socket also have long lead line and may not work at high speed do anyone out there have experience knowledge of this field i would greatly appreciate help any ideas  name of company manufacturing holders sockets packages would help p s the multi layer fancy gaas package seem like a bit of overkill
 i use a bunch a weight when building a model airplane hung them on the stringer across the stringer or whatever work pretty well
 try the folk at dimolex corp  la crescenta ca 91214  their number be 818 957 7001  they make membrane keypad that be very flat in layout from 2 to 128 key they have standard model tactile model with stainless dome under each key to make a  click you can feel a well a backlit model some of them can even be cut with scissors to form a funky shape other than a rectangle many of the model be available in a  kit which include a bezel color and plain key cover and rub on letter to make your own layout one piece price cheap though a they want 10 for one four position pad  kit  and 45 for a 40 position  kit  i have no affiliation with dimolex or any company connect with them i  have  purchase a couple of keypad from them and be pleased with what i get
 paul unfortunately there be not too many retail outlet that  ll stock just about every chip make the stuff they will stock be the one that  ll sell like standard dram  s 80386  s 68000  s etc etc i e i cna t think of any  one stop shopping store the closest you can get be to pick up a copy of byte magazine or the circuit cellar popular electronics and the like and flip through them distributor like wyle electronics hamilton avnet pioneer electronics etc etc normally deal with end users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything     they only deal with people who buy by the hundred or more each distributor represent and sell a variety of different non competing manufacturer what do i mean by this suppose abc electronics sell intel 80386  s a pretty good bet that they be sell any of amd  s 386  s or vice versa they also can obtain just about  any  chip you want from a manufacturer they represent who know you might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them but be suprised if you do also bear in mind that the 1 or 2 qty price they will charge you will be  much  great than what a mail order outlet will charge my advice if gon na be design anything try to stick with off the shelf stuff go to get stuck if you use too many esoteric part sooner or later good luck
 distribution usa reply to lihan ccwf cc utexas edu while on the net bugging everyone be there such a thing a a chip or chipset to decode code 39 barcode i ask for a couple of reason    mainly i want a reasonably compact encode scheme to write information on magstripe card and code 39 appear to be about right if the  right  way to do it be something else and reasonably easy can someone let me know i might not get a chance to reply too quickly to this or my earlier post but i  ll get to them within a couple day i think
 here  s something i post about this a few year ago not fully up to date with all the new variation some of which be just different manufacturer  s synonym          in practical term ignore the technological detail this be my view of the family nb i be not a giant corporation which influence my view on thing like availability and backward compatibility 74 the original speed good power consumption fair effectively obsolete now use 74ls or later except for a  very  few oddball function like 7407 which be hard to find in newer family 74h modification of 74 for high speed at the cost of high power consumption very obsolete use 74f 74l modification of 74 for low power at the cost of low speed very obsolete use cmos 74s later modification of 74 for even high speed at some cost in power consumption effectively obsolete use 74f 74ls combination of 74l and 74s for speed comparable to 74 with low power consumption best all round ttl now wide variety of device 74f fast a blaze power not too bad the clear choice for high speed in ttl availability and price generally good 74as fail competitor to 74f although a few 74as part do thing that be hard to find in 74f and thus be still useful 74als possible replacement for 74ls generally soup up still fairly new availability and price possibly a problem 74c fairly old family cmos device with ttl pinouts compete with 4000 series not too successfully obsolete use 4000 or newer cmos 74 family 4000 thrown in a the major non 74 non ecl logic family the old cmos family still viable because of  very  wide range of device low power consumption and wide range of supply voltage not fast very forgive and easy to work with beware static electricity but that comment applies to many other modern logic family too there be neat device in this family that exist in no other the clear choice when speed be not important 74hc a new attempt at 74 pinout cmos fast compare to old cmos power consumption often low than ttl possibly a good choice for general purpose logic assume availability and affordability cmos logic level  not  ttl one beware very limited range of supply voltage compare to old cmos also major rise of power consumption at faster speed 74hct 74hc with ttl logic level much the same comment a 74hc read the fine print on thing like power consumption    ttl compatibility in cmos involves some compromise 10k thrown in for speed freak the low end of ecl various source claim that it be  easier  to work with than super fast ttl for serious high speed work less forgive though read and follow the rule or it work availability to hobbyist limited can be expensive 100k for real speed freak hot ecl harder to handle than 10k and inconvenient package much more useful datasheets however a for compatibility between family the 74 family except 74c and 74hc be all more or less logic level compatible but how many 74x device you can drive from one 74y output varies enormously with x and y  you just have to read the spec and do the arithmetic 74c and 74hc be compatible with the others with a bit of hassle 4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depend on what supply voltage 4000 be use 10k or 100k to anything else be considerable hassle me i use 4000 and 74ls with a sprinkle of 74f 74hc t and 10k be interest but i use either significantly yet
 what do you mean by    police band    there be no such thing anyway radar detector work in share band if you apply your test all of those radar operate door opener in mall would be illegal one of the great problem here be that there be too many ill educated read illiterate people make too many law about subject on which they be incompetent there may well be law referee to    police band    they be almost certainly local in scope state or county create by well meaning but incompetent idiot unfortunaltely law do not have to be sensible or even enforceable lawmaker exist to pas law and will continue to do so until the day where you be face with death for not do x and amputation of all your limb for do x     the choice will be yours note no smiley
 i have notice a lot of electronics question by people who be obviously not    tuned in    to electronics many of them have rather simple answer and many of them require a circuit diagram rather than muck up the network why you write to me send a self  address stamp envelop and i  ll answer your question if i can
 or _documentation_ for the program a lot of shareware out there be very similar in the approach send in your money and you get documentation and a free upgrade to the late version perhaps even support of some small degree whatever you want to offer that be    well    than the circulate version figure about 50 a i have see it really hurt legit user shareware be still much cheaper than the alternative                                                                                                                                visit the sound board bb  1 214 596 2915 a wildcat bb          obdis all opinion be specifically disclaim no one be responsible
 i second that suggestion although i own the hp portable deskjet i  do  own the hp deskjet 500  it give the nice output with only a minor loss of quality for all intensive purpose paper letter resume i treat my deskjet like a laser printer you  do  have to look a bit closely to see the blur in the character only one grudge the ink that hp give you do smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture even though the ink be waterproof however you would have to spend about 500 more for laser quality the cannon bubblejet be nice however they seem to have a much support eg driver for popular program a the hp ink jets also hp deskjet regular plus 500 500c accepts xerox paper i believe that the cut sheet feeder be an option for the cannon bubblejet if you mind refill your printer with cheap ink say fountain pen ink then the hp deskjets be  very  cheap to maintain i paid 3 50 for my last bottle of ink and i expect it to last 9 month  kimball who work for hp but just love his printer very much
 hmm     now where be that ad for the combination radio hand cranked generator flashlight siren i saw function generator have a 50mv offset and the amplitude  s too high sure already get the right idea ignore the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just run it into say a voltage divider make of 990 ohm in series with 10 ohm this new circuit be the thevenin equivalent of one that put out 1 100 of the original voltage and have an output impedence of negligibly less than 10 ohm you may want to monkey with the value a little depend on whether you care more about the _exact_ divide ratio or the availability of part hows that sound     joel kolstad

 actually the reason you see so many cool tower at fossil plant be 1 fossil unit multiple unit per plant be generally small than nuclear plant 300 mwe seem to be a very popular size when many fossil plant be built the average nuclear plant be 1000 mwe 2 many fossil plant be grandfathered when water discharge regulation be adopt    why those old dirt burner harm anything let  em go     3 power draft cool tower low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site be quite popular with fossil plant 4 fossil plant use to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually the condense environment be essentially the same for plant of similar size the issue be the same regardless of where the heat come from condenser be run at a high a vacuum a possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure be normally water  s vapor pressure at the condense temperature it be desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplet because moisture in the steam cause severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blade and because entrain water move at high velocity cause erosion of the condenser tube the coldest and thus low pressure condense environment be always the best a related issue be that of pump the condensate from the hotwell where the water end up after drip off the condenser tube since the condenser be at a very low pressure the only force drive the condensate into the hotwell pump be gravity if the condensate be too hot or the gravity head be too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubble and cause the condensate pump to cavitate this be a particularly destructive form of cavitation that be to be avoid at all cost the hotwell pump be locate in the low point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pump how much low they must be be a function of how hot the water be allow to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperature run between 100 and 120 degree depend on the temperature of the river water this term be use to describe the river grade water even when the cool tower system be operating in close loop mode and essentially no river water be pumped when the river water temperature be high in the summer operator will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there be a tradeoff involve since high hotwell level will encroach onto the condense tube and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cool tower the temperature of the discharge water from the cool tower be set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it be very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperature exceed 70 degree a vast difference from the typical    95 95    day 95 degree 95 humidity we see routinely in the east it be not unusual particularly where the econazis have be successful in clamp rigid discharge water temperature limit on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the fire rate when the air temperature get too high and the condenser can not handle the heat load without excessive pressure true actually secondary plant the part that make electricity and feed feedwater to the boiler water chemistry have be the bastard stepchild until recently and have not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemist have just in the past decade or so fully understood the cost of impure water by    impure    i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolve oxygen secondary water be now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory john

 in this case would the switch control voltage be  7v to turn the switch off and 0v to turn the switch on
 1  can low voltage light be control with an x10 module by put it before the transformer it seem to work even the dimmer work not very reliable will it damage the module can it be do reliably 2  i put a motion switch heath to a low voltage light it work but now it be broken too much current how can i get arround that 3  how can i increase the intensity of a light use the x10 pc computer interface without have it go 100 on first and then down i be do my own program not the x10 program
 and the measure of current amp be actually name after both the amp company and the amphenol company both company revolutionize electronics by simulatenously realize that the performance of connector and socket be affected by the amount of current run through the wire sorry the unit for current be the ampere which be the name of a french man name ampere who study electrical current the term amp be just an abbreviation of it the company amp come after the ampere unit be already in use the ohmite company be the first to characterize resistance by number thus our use of the ohm     i know about this one but it sound right be you two joking be the entire internet flame you two ahh now i remember that ohmite company be the first introduce    the pink color resistor    only for electronics work female    manuel arrevola velasco       true e mail manolo taf fundesco es       dod 1033 yes i have take a bit of flame on this one i must  ve be half asleep when i post a response to joseph greggo
 i have a new scope and i thought save a few buck by buying one with a function generator built in after have it awhile i notice two thing about the function generator for one there seem to be a bias even when the  pull offset be push in that be i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mv bias the other _really_ annoy thing be that the damn output go below about 1v p p  i be a student you may have guess from my previous post and i often have to measure the input impedance of various circuit i build many of the circuit have maximum input signal of way less than 500mv amplitude and most have input impedance in the 10  s of kohm range the thing be in order to use my function generator i have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable then of course to measurethe input impedance of my circuit i be go to have to throw in another resistor in series with the 50ohm output of the generator i could just ignore it but now with this little divider there i have to figure that in kind of a pain in the as be there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem the box would tkae the function generator input low the voltage and give an output impedance that be some low unchanging number i would want to low the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but like to have this box not be active any quick idea the scope  s not broken for other reason i have sent it to the shop to get repair and they replace it the function generator be the same way on that one too please help a i be feel very stupid today
 recently picked up some til311 display chip but i find any information on them it seem they be no longer make by ti and i have an old enough data book it appear to have a dot matrix lead display capable of show one hex digit it be in a 14 pin dip package but pin 6 9 and 11 be not present if you have any information on this part pinout power requirments function     please send me e mail thank you
 i bought this chip from suncoast technology and try to build their dtmf decoder circuit but not work     if anyone have the pinouts and possibly the voltage spec sure appreciate it if someone could fax email or snail mail a copy of the spec sheet for this chip that would be even well please email me if you can help thanks in advance    mont pierce

 imprecise this description 1  ignores the role of the ballast 2  misrepresents the heating effect in the starter the bimetalic strip cool down immediately after the contact short circuit because the neon discharge stop and much less heat be generate from the i 2r loss in the metal a compare to the neon discharge the starter contact open before the tube fire actually the tube fire a a result of the back emf generate in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter  s contact a capacitor be connect in parallel with the contact to prevent excessive arc during the fire the neon reionizes but do not draw sufficient current to prevent fire of the tube itself
 true especially for electrolytic capacitor at high temperature low power quartz oscillator be usually 32 khz and these have significant temperature drift which one often notice while wear the watch on one  s wrist low temperature sensitivity be available in other crystal type which unfortunately be large and high frequency 1 mhz or so and take more battery power programmable timer might be less accurate but they be more power stingy than suitable crystal oscillator

 from what i understand about radar dectectors all they be be a passive device much like the radio in your car they work a an antenna pick up that radar signal that the radar gun sends out therefore there would be no way of detect a radar detector any more than there would be of detect whether some one have a radio in their car

 after i have produce a schematic with pads logic how do i import it into pads pcb to create a pcb pattern the only way gotten it to work be to output a futurenet netlist and then import this into pads pcb be there another way of do this i see any information in the instruction provide but i might have miss something any suggestion would be greatly appreciate thanks
 one not so quick question to throw out there for you guy     for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the follow spec voltatge adjustable from 1 12v current  limited  at 1a voltage must stay within 2 of designate value for i from 0 1a ac ripple less than 5 mv rms of course we just use an adjustable voltage current limiting regulator chip our problem be with the current limit i e found stuff to do the rest of the part of the circuit what the supply must do if present with a load which would draw more than 1a give the supply voltage be reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp thus if we be to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one amp if we measure the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12v we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be 1v the only basic idea we have see for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefore reduce the output so do anybody have any idea we could work from thanks in advance andy collins kc6yey acollins uclink berkeley edu
 yes but     the minimization of gate be important in part because of timing consideration a ttl gate have the basic structure of and or invert and an inversion of a sum of a product be just exactly one gate delay the reason to find a minimal sum of product be that this match a hardware optimization a positive or gate such a the 9 gate solution us have two gate delay and there  s another gate delay in the second term so that the second solution while simpler in logic symbol can be expect to be something less than optimal in the real world ecl be similar to ttl in that it can support an or and gate with the minimum delay unlike ttl you get both true and inverse output for  free when use ecl pal be basically large programmable and or invert gate with your choice of internal connection between the various section and perhaps some latch so a minimum sum of product also be a way to shoehorn a logic design into a few pal not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gate but some software package claim to allow you to do so and will take just about any mess of gate a a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ic and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job xilinx  s xact software do this by treat each logic block a a macro and expand it all out then simplify

 here  s the scoop when you get your home brew receiver work would you be willing to share it with the rest of u i always want to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it pin 1 signal ground pin 2 signal pin 3 always hot  6 volt pin 4  6 volt hot only when preamp be turn on pin 5 infrared repeater connector the infrared repeater jack on the back of the preamp be not connect to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin 5  there be a 150 ohm resistor between the two jack with a 1 5k from pin 5 to ground the signal pin 2 in the preamp be sum with the built in ir receiver they use a chip call cx20106a and a bjt to amplify the signal i would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it a the external receiver if you need more info let me know
 use on chip capacitor to reduce ground bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that have 50pf load on the clock line design be in 2 micron n well cmos use the mosis scalable design rule here be some thought on the bypass capacitor 1 they help much with simultaneous output switch    there be still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground return so you still get ground and power line bounce 2 they do help a lot with on chip load a i have with the high load on the clock line 3 the transient you be try to suppress be really high frequency so forget about large area of poly thin oxide diff capacitor since the rc time constant be too large what i do be to make a metal2 metal poly diff sandwich but put a lot of hole in the poly layer allow frequent diff metal1 contact i forget exactly how wide the poly line be if i be do this design again probably omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead use just m2 m1 and poly and substrate but that have such a high resistance it can be ignore at these speed 4 you be probably well off try to tune your circuit to run with slightly slow edge and low voltage swing especially for output signal than spending chip area on capacitor i have spare space on the die since the circuit be too big for a mosis tiny chip and the next size up be twice a big a i need kevin karplus    kevin karplus karplus ce ucsc edu

 you can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book    the hungry hiker  s guide to good food    by gretchen mchugh the heat source be a 100 watt light bulb basically a vertical wooden box with ventilation hole in the top and bottom lot of them you want the air to flow the light bulb go in the bottom and wire cake rack be space every 6    start about 10    above the bulb or at a slightly high cost in electricity you can do what i do use your oven note i do this in an electric oven some gas oven may not have a low enough set put food to be dry on cookie tin or rack in the oven set oven to 140 degree the low set on my oven if yours go down to 120 probably even well stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stay open about an inch this allows for airflow leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hour check it often since this dry it much faster than the dehydrator if you be use cookie sheet instead of rack turn the stuff over halfway through if you want more info e mail me since this really the right sub for this stuff gerald belton ozonehole com slmr 2 1 i still miss my bos but my aim be improve
 write a good manual to go with the software the hassle of photocopy the manual be offset by simplicity of purchasing the package for only 15 also consider offering an inexpensive but attractive perc for register user for instance a coffee mug you could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of dollar so consider pricing the product at 17 95 lucky if only 20 of the instance of your program in use be non licensed user the best approach be to estimate your loss and accomodate that into your price structure sure it hurt legitimate user but too bad retailer have to charge off loss to shoplifter onto pay customer the software industry be the same unless your product be exceptionally unique use an ostensibly copy proof disk will just send your customer to the competetion
 be to snip i be follow this so sorry if somebody already mention this but you could grab a lemon i think potato work too but not sure a strip of copper and a strip of zinc i think you can get the metal in a hardware store or hobby shop maybe stick the strip in the lemon so they touch and get a measurable voltage not a lot but hey a lemon a i recall we have to hook something like ten of these thing to get an appreciable amount of current because of the mondo internal resistance but if you just need a demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something

 fortunately wire wrapping be a well wiring technique than most at high frequency cray computer up to the x mp at least all have wirewrapped backplanes wirewrap get into trouble at much high frequency than any ttl can handle the  increase  of wiring capacitance be not really relevant you have to use transmission line technique and the capacitance be no problem hand powered be a terrible choice imho unless you be a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connection at a time your hand will cramp battery powered wire wrap gun be available in the 150 range and so be the little twiddle stick manual type 15 for a modest project of a couple hundred connection prefer to borrow a professional ac unit     or a pneumatic one
 the atari 2600 use a 6502 cpu just like their entire 8 bit line 400 800 1200 1400 1440 130xe 65xe computer a well a the 5200 game machine the 2600 have some extra asic chip that be basically modify graphic chip and pia  s for the joystick later model 2600 might have incorporate many of the chip into one ascus a the weight of the machine and part count decrease a lot over the year additionally i think the 2600 use 2k 4k and up to 8k of rom for their game i have no idea how much ram it have to work with but i would hazard a guess of 2 or 4k ram think come from a lot of hack with the 800 and 130xe computer and occasionally hack with the 2600 fix it for monitor composite video use and audio hookup also i tryed to make a cartridge less system that store the rom into a ram cartridge that could be load up at some prior time a way to backup cartridge heard of a setup like this where game could be bought cheaply on fsk recorded tape then you would load them into a special ram cartidge and play them anyways if interested in look for 2600 equipment get two 2600 machine around one composite a v modify and lotsa cartridge willing to sell for reasonable offer shipping and handle play it anymore since go to computer nintendo interested in that too

 since your mosfet be a 1972 vintage probably not a very good one by today  s standard if you have an idea about it voltage and current rating e g 60vdc 6a you can probably get away with replace it with anything with well spec early mosfets have a gate source voltage rating of approximately     20 vdcmax and they would usually turn completely    on    at  10vdc otherwise mosfets be not really mysterious    more or less voltage control current source if the mosfet in your circuit be use a an open loop voltage control current source you may have to experiment with various gain altering technique
 ok so your a ham well tune in 10 7mhz or 455khz these number sound like some you have herd before thats right you guess it they be common if number every super het receiver have a local oscillator s which generates an if this be what your detector detector be detect the local oscillator

 i have a similar idea for a fax answering machine switch to put both machine on one line you order distinctive ring from your phone company this be 3 month here you get a second unpublished phone number when someone call this number your phone ring with short ring instead of long ring you set up your answer machine on 4 ring and your fax on six ring give out the new a your fax a device would measure the length of ring when it detects a short ring it turn off your answer machine five ring later your fax pick up the call this should be cheaper and more elegant than the 80 switch now available but not what i do give out the new to my friend and customer this should leave the old for telemarketers etc i pick up the phone when i hear the long ring
 he one i have see be all fluorescent tube maybe you could find a small tube to go in one of those hand held fluoro lantern blue light ultra violet by definition go from the blue end of the spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum x ray cosmic ray etc possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility which people with false eye lenses can see easily since your lens that soak up most of the uv however since most people use uv to get other thing to glow and the near blue be less energetic it would probably not work a well if it work at all lecture on basic atomic physic fit in here about electron transition quantum leap and stuff

 ok here could be the first question or answer or something q i want to copyprotect a program i write how should i do it a you would be wise not to copyprotect that program you see those people that want to get a crack copy of your program will go to various length to crack your program and some of those cracker be good and know the common trick so the copy protection stop those ok then what about legitimate user copy protection can be a hassle for legitimate user and can hinder them in their work expecially if there be some    key    item that can get lose so the copy protection help much of the legitimate user but would make life somewhat of a misery for them this be my opinion and i speak a a legitimate user you be of course free to have your opinion about this subject

 i be also sceptical about the amp be built in the far east or where ever but if you look in the amp and see what component they use and how it be design you can easily see why the amplifier sound so brilliant good point     also i be surprised that the component they use off shore be of inferior quality a long a it be properly design and robust premium component be use it matter where it be assemble definately i agree wholeheartedly if they can build the amp where the labour be not so expensive they can afford to put decent component in and go to more effort to improve the design of the amplifier a adcom have do i can not see why people say the amplifier last not with those quality component inside sure the amp run very fairly hot but how you get an amp to sound incredibly good an amp that run hot have no bearing on how gon na sound the amp you have probably be run class a the whole day actually be wary of excessively hot amp  cauz even though the component inside may be rat to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of  any  electronic component regardless of quality in fact an amp that do run hot to the touch be because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp want to skimp on heatsinking or cool to save cost hmmmmm     sure i mean to imply that because of the heat generate the amp sound good my adcom gfp 535ii run fairly warm not hot to the touch but enough to satisfy me that the amp be run nicely i like it when an amp run dead cold it make one think that the amp be do nothing the heatsinks that adcom us in their amp be certainly far for skimpy massive thing with heating vent both below and above more than enough to carry away excessive heat my opinion once again

 i have the good luck to obtain an eico dynamic conductance tube tester for a song unfortunately i be a little out of key the only thing wrong with it be an open meter movement do anyone know where i can find either another meter movement like it a dead but not the meter dead unit or schematic to specify the current scale of the meter movement i can cut and paste a more sensitive movement in if i can find what the full scale current be or     be eico still contactable the thing be a model 666  nope not a joke or any sort of snide reference

 hi just built a valve preamp and use a diode capacitor voltage multiplier to step the 12vac supply voltage up to approx 260vdv a the load resistance increase the rc constant decrease and hence the output voltage drop i need a high an output voltage a possible about 260v the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stage ie 14 diode and 14 capacitor each capacitor develops about 38v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitors 260v each capacitor be 100mfd at 68v if i increase each of the capacitor rating 220 470mfd that will increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitor be go to be a little expensive a i need 14 of them so 1  what would happen if i connect a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitor will it a i assume increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant if it do and my output voltage becomes more stable by do this then i will have kill two bird with one stone     a i be experience some 50hz ripple and hence amp hum and this new capacitor will  smooth this out and 2  can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be place in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50hz main hum low resistance possible not get my preamp with me at the moment because it be too much of a distraction     at university and get to get my dissertation finish in two week hence mail not play with my solderoing iron it  ll be cheaper too in the long run     especially if 14 new large capacitor work a plan email please     always read the net        thanks in advance   chris                                                                         name mr chris smith twang on that  ole guitar  addrs scst83 uk ac liv csc  uni liverpool university  quest to build more and more hardware  dgree computer science                                                                           what ever the sun may be it be certainly not a ball of flame gas       d h  lawrence

 hello let me introduce a problem when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter use ac mode my output be an rms value a peak value over 2 square right when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac my output be equal to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave i assume that a digital voltmeter make some kind of integration of the input value and divide it over the wave period right now i use it to measure the same square wave a above but distort by high frequency harmonic ideally output should be the same but     the output value be only about 10 of the previous one why what be the nature of this output value what do the voltmeter actually measure and what do it show related question less important to me what be advantage and disadvantage of digital voltmeter to compare with analog one thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at avm1993 zeus tamu edu or open a discussion here i would appreciate either way alexander v  mamishev ____________________________________________________________________________ power system automation laboratory phone office 409 845 4623 department of electrical engineering phone home 409 846 5850 texas a m university fax 409 862 2282 college station tx 77843 usa internet avm1993 zeus tamu edu

 mixer have a wide variety of implementation the mini circuits part you mention be a doubly balanced diode mixer but active one bjt fet seem more popular in consumer receiver you might call mcl they have a nice catalog the universal answer for wide coverage theory practice rf design be the _arrl handbook_ publish by the american radio relay league the radio amateur organization any technical bookstore can order you one the book be superb with lot of accessible theory construction project and generally interest stuff you might also check out _solid state design for the radio amateur_ i think by hayward and someone this have sharper design and test information about subsystem like mixer
 wonder if possible to use radio wave to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver seem to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance this would be for short distance 2000 ft and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inch or so how about measure vertical distance a well any chance or be i get ridiculous what frequency would be best for this or do matter sorry if    muck up    the network with one of those question best answer by bill willis via u mail     and i apologize for not be    tuned in    to electronics

 here  s one i hope some knowledgeable reader will make a comment or contribution to in the state of virginia radar detector be illegal period if you be caught with one it will be confiscate on the spot and will not be return until after you appear in court and pay your fine the fine for have a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle even if it be not on be 250 00 sorry tourist ignorance of the law be no excuse they will get you too it use to be that the only way the law could be enforce be for an officer to actually see the radar detector not any more many law enforcement agency be now use radar detector detector right a super sensitive receiver that be capable of pick up rf from the radar detector itself my first reaction be    no way    but guess again these little bugger really work and the police be write citation right and left for people use radar detector one news story quote an officer a say that he have found the radar detector in all of the car he stop except one and he could never figure out where it be but he knew it be there this tends to make one assume there be few false arrest now before i get flame please understand that i do drive at or near the speed limit i do not need a radar detector to keep me from get a speed ticket but i do like to know when my speed be be clocked or a speed trap be function my radar detector now stay lock in my trunk when i be in virginia which be what they want and yes what the law say and i intend to obey the law and be only use in state where it be legal for my fellow ham i be not a microwave person my mind only work in the hf spectrum between 10 and 80 meter microwave enlightment may be necessary so the question be what do the radar detector detector actually detect would additional shielding grounding bypassing shield stray rf generate by a radar detector or be the rf actually be emit by the detector antenna be any brand    quieter    than others

 currently i be use the 8051 microcontroller with external eprom   in order to drive the dc motor with direction i use the pulse width modultion thru software control assembly language program however i be afraid that they will be overhead and thus alter the pulse timing my question be be the software pwm control reliable i understand that port 0 be a latch and so i vary the duty cycle by set it high first and at the desire
 this probably only tell you that the dc block capacitor in series between the one chip single ended audio amp and the speaker terminal be there open it up and look for the power amp    ic    be fairly obvious replace the one connect to the dead output well one thing you should do be poke around the terminal of the power amp chip use a probe with a 10m resistor like a scope probe connect to the input of a small audio amp w speaker if you find line level input to both chip one of the chip be bad and can probably replace pretty easily if you want to pick off a near line level signal suitable for feed to an outboard amp the outer leg of the volume control pot will often be good enough this be  before  the volume control and usually before the tone and balance control too if you take off from the center and ground leg of the volume pot this will be after the volume control but again probably before the other control if the unit be a modern type with an electronic volume control chip you should probably forget the whole thing

 i have an adcom gfa 555 that i get in 1985  there certainly anything magic about it the component use be decent but nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade component the gfa 555 be a nice piece of equipment glad that adcom have the gut to not over do the packaging it irks me when i see audiophile orient equipment whose case and heat sink probably cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they be suppose to serve i see any big deal about the geographic region in which something be assemble this be especially true for something a low technology a a gfa 555 hope that a gfa 545 would still work well after several year except under condition of extreme abuse there much there to go wrong

 how about call someone with the caller id service and have them call you back with the number
 yes i know it sound crazy call it an urge call it what you want just ask why anyway like to build a uv flashlight cheaply    flashlight    mean it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if necessary my main question be the bulb where can i get uv bulb do they need a lot of power etc  etc not too concerned with whether long wave or short wave but hey if anyone have a cheap source of bulb i  ll take both one other thing a friend of mine mention something about near uv light be cheaper to get at than actual uv light do anyone know what he be refer to thanks much
 yeah right and the company be start by george simon ohmite
 i want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other posting    near uv light     is     actual uv light    the    near    mean that it be close to the visible spectrum i e of relatively long wavelength not that it be    nearly uv    sure you can figure out now just what    far uv    be regular incandenscent flashlight bulb emit tiny amount of uv in the near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be use to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source strong source be go to require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tube such a fluorescent tube with uv phosphor be careful though strong uv source can cause physiological damage especially to the eye the shorter wavelength be the most dangerous it project a beam like a flashlight but replace the tube in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tube would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source it would be bright enough to be useful but not dangerously so

 gee i get the idea from somewhere that device like this be in common use in wwii so that commander on board ship could bellow at the troop land on a beach for example which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid 60s at a communication conference a marine corp communication officer say he care much for all the spread spectrum multi access expensive communication system that people be talk about at the time what he want be a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a 4 95 japanese transistor radio stuck in the ear of every marine hit the beach    haynes cats ucsc edu haynes cats bitnet

 i get a question from my dad which i really answer and appreciate some net wisdom his question be about some 18 24    diameter ball which be attach to electric power line in his area see up to a half dozen between two pole neither of u have any experience with electric power distribution my only guess be that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the inductance of the grid but why so many between two pole anyone know what they really be be there a related faq for this be there a well group to submit to both appreciate some enlightenment
 but     if you be in the habit of try to repair old and obsolete machine the old data book be a goldmine of information you can not get anywhere else if you be try to find a modern replacement for an obsolete part the original spec really come in handy design out of the new book but save the old one or donate them to a ham if anybody in phoenix disagrees i  ll drive over and help them  get rid  of all their old data book

 here be a different viewpoint in practice there be little difference in quality but more care be need with inkjet because smudge etc can happen a cheap laser printer do not manage that sort of throughput and on top of that how long do the _first_ sheet take to print inkjets be faster than you say and in both case the computer often have trouble keep up with the printer i have a 486 33 and a lot of driver can not keep up with the printer a sage say to me    do you want one copy or lot of copy       one       inkjet    paper cost be the same and both can use refill long term the laserprinter will need some expensive replacement part consumables and on top of that be the amortisation cost which favour the low purchase cost printer hp inkjets understand pcl so in many case a laserjet driver will work if the software package have no inkjet driver there be one wild difference between the two printer a laserprinter be a page printer whilst an inkjet be a line printer this mean that a laserprinter can rotate graphic image whilst an inkjet can not few driver actually use this facility there be also the matter of downloadable font and so on
 get two line come into my apartment two different telephone number when i order the second line instal instead of bring out another 4 wire bundle the telco just connect up to my yellow and black wire so i have one line on red green and the other on yellow black today i be monitoring the voltage on both line i have a voltmeter across the red and green and read back 52 volt i then lift up the receiver on my second line black yellow wire the voltage drop to 31 volt on the first line red green wire i repeat this experiment with the second line monitoring black yellow and lift the handset off the cradle on the red and green line it also drop to 31 volt why be this i thought these be separate line next i go to the 66 block and disconnect the blue and white line come in from the telco cable i then disconnect all the phone in my apartment and go back to the 66 block and do some resistance measurement both line read open i  ll appreciate any help on this be this consider normal guy urbina

     i think you post your article 15 day too late april 1st be over i like nuclear powerplants but i think not fair to tell such    story    about them ok let me try to explain what that tower be use to  1st even the modernst nuclear powerplant be only a simple steam engine it have an hightech    boiler    but the rest be still verry verry conventional and if already visit any condensation  powerstation you l have see the cool tower too if you look at any good book about thermophysics find a chapter about the    carnot process    which describes how to get energy from a temperature difference and that be the reason for cool tower too you only can get energy if an temperature gradient that mean that you have steam on the one side and need to cool down the steam  till you get water again on the other side if you want to get aprox 30 of the energy you or well the uranium brought into the water to let it boil if you only have hot steam on the one and    cold    steam on the other side loose much more of the energy and so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30 of energy that carnot will give them the cool tower be for cool the steam the vapor see be not the steam of the main core circulation because that steam be radioactive the circulation be divide in at least 2 circuit connect about heat exchanger to prevent radioactive pollution of the environment  2nd ok the main core be hot but even in the modernst hightemperature  reactor htr they only run at  800 deg celsius this be still verry far away from uranium melt point which be somewhere around 2000 deg celsius but have lot  s of problem with the boiler  s steel because at this temperature the metal be attack by steam and will corrode verry fast this be only for bwr  s the new he cool reactor have temperature up to 1200 deg celsius but this be only experimental  3rd i personaly think that nuclear waste should be a low a ever possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the year today 1 mrem and next year 0 5 mrem be 0 75 mrem at all it accumulates and even in 80 year still have 1 5 mrem and not interested in glow in the night and get child with 2 head this be my point of view only my 0 02 christian reisel student of electronic science    christian reisel goldammerweg 2 w 6601 buebingen germany voice  49 6805 22179 fax email  49 6805 22179 pgp pubkey

 there should be a connection of the ground wire to a ground in the breaker box there also should be a connection of the neutral wire to a ground in the breaker box there should be no other place in the building where such a connection occurs i e not in any of the outlet box the neutral white wire be a  grounding conductor for the plug and be not safe to touch while the ground green wire be a  protective ground and carry no current unless some kind of electrical fault have occur safe to touch the protective ground but not to touch the ground conductor because there be current in the ground conductor it outlet box end will not be at the same ground potential a it breaker box end
 like to see this info a well a for wavelength i think primarily go to find two 880 nm     a bit and or 950 nm     a bit usually it be about 10 nm either way the two most common i have see be 880 and 950 but i have also heard of 890 and 940  not sure that the 10 nm one way or another will make a great deal of difference another suggestion find a brand of tv that us an ir remote and go look at the sam photofact for it you can often find some very detailed schematic and part list for not only the receiver but the transmitter a well include carrier freq spec and tone decode spec if the system us that

 well one reason for get conflict answer be that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do a continuous conductor be a good electrostatic shield do you have signal on your board that need shield rom other thing this shield do much good for magnetic field unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shield like a faraday cage

 a a general rule no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contact the noise you hear be due to the momentary opening and closing of the path the noiseless way of transfer audio be to ground the circuit in high impedance audio circuit a resistive    t    be construct close to characteristic impedance of the circuit ground the imputs connect to the t transfer the audio in low impedance circuit transformer be usually use and the input be short out or ground secondary be parallel at the characteristic impedance sometimes if it be necessary to actually switch audio a second contact be use to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switch time telephone relay be handy because contact can be adjust to    make before break and vica versa    but i see any of these for year nowadys switch be do electronically with op amp etc a novel circuit i use to build be a primitive    optical isolator       it consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp all package in a tube when the lamp be off the cell be high resistance turn the lamp on and the resistance lower passing the audio once again this device in a    t    switch the audio vary the lamp resistance give a remote volume control use 2 variable resister and you have a mixer lot of luck    73 tom                                                                                  tom wagner audio visual technician malaspina college nanaimo british columbia 604 753 3245 loc 2230 fax 755 8742 callsign ve7gda weapon  45 kentucky rifle snail mail to site q4 c2 rr 4 nanaimo british columbia canada v9r 5x9
 i want to upgrade my system and be think of buying adcom seperates i have heard from alot of people though that adcom sound great but that the component be make cheaply and therefore last very long the time estimate heard be like only 3 or 4 year be this true i own the adcom 60w power amp a far a concerned there  s no amp which can touch it at the price range the build quality be very impressive and be far superior to other amp in the price range the whole amplifier be extremely solid with massive heat sink and very solid case if you open the amp up there be only very good quality component in and the amp seem to be design extremely well perfect symmetry for both channel and two transformer one for each channel the binding post on the back of the amplifier be virtually the same a those on the classe model 70 ie very good i be also sceptical about the amp be built in the far east or where ever but if you look in the amp and see what component they use and how it be design you can easily see why the amplifier sound so brilliant i can not see why people say the amplifier last not with those quality component inside sure the amp run very fairly hot but how you get an amp to sound incredibly good my last point i recently audition the adcom preamp something like the 545 or something it be two year old and it still sound like new if you build an amplifier decently like the adcom  s they will sound brilliant and last a long time period just my thought but then i do own one of adcom  s amp

 back in the 70  s i be a service technician for a cash register company the cash register use microprocessor circuit and back then they be very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise the big problem come from outlet that be not properly ground in almost every place we go to do an installation we found outlet with the ground connect to the neutral for 99 9 of the thing you can plug into one of these they work fine for our cash register they be a nightmare    line noise tend to scramble the memory periodically with modern electronics use switch power supply this should be less of a problem even the company i use to work for be no longer recommend a dedicate line with a seperate ground for their equipment i imagine if you check most household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral be connect although not ideal it should be o k for most application    slmr 2 1 my reality check just bounce

 now there  s a good idea all you need be 20 amp dc for a few minute and a good wetware memory be i use wp or autocad or     i thought of the same idea myself a few day ago get a fairly new car battery that i take along in my 4x4 when i go camp and it sits around useless when home i wish i could get a batteryless ups to use it with or use it with a heavy duty 5 volt regulator to supply the pc but i guess need  5v and  12v and  12 too 2 more battery an alternative would be to leave a 40 amp battery charger hooked up to the battery and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter run all the time and when the power go out voi la the 110vac converter keep on run off the battery and then i could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camp trip
 i have a ge emerson 13    color tv for about 3 year and one fine day while we be watch something i doubt if the program be the cause we heard a mild explosion our screen go blank but there be sound so we thought  oh we have special effect on the program but soon the sound stop and smoke start to appear at the back of the tv the brilliant ee we be we unplugged the tv and call customer service only to be thrown around by please hold i will transfer u to blah blah   finally we abandon the idea of try to fix the tv and get a new one we want a big one too after all the story what i want to know be be my problem an isolated incident or a common one i recall reading about russian tv explode but not here in the u why would the picture tube explode or even smoke i still have the left over tv set i might dig into it this summer any idea where i can get part for these thing probably will cost more than tv
 i be told that this be an environmental base move i be also told that there will be  somthing else to replace the battery club like maybe the 360k floppy club see
 not necessarily true a short in one if near the maximum series voltage drop will overvoltage the other one and short it too more
 no no nooo the ground green wire be for safety no current be suppose to flow in it under normal condition this mean that there  s normally no voltage drop in it either it be suppose to be safe to touch the ground wire     even if ground in some other way at the same time the neutral white wire be a dave vanderbyl correctly say the return for the hot wire since current flow in it there  s a voltage drop if you plug a heavy load into a properly wired ground outlet you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground they be suppose to be connect together at the breaker panel     but nowhere repeat nowhere else well almost there be strange exception for thing like sub panels what you can do if you want three prong outlet without additional wiring be to use a gfci outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper in fact depend on where you be put your new outlet s a gfci may be  required  there be a faq on electrical wiring post regularly to rec woodworking and news answers it go into great detail on these issue include gfcis and you should probably read it before ask any more question i  ll mail a copy to you append a copy here and will ask the writer to cross post it here in the future
 do anyone know if a source for the tcm3105 modem chip a use in the baycom and my pmp modem ideally something that be gear toward hobbyist small quantity mail order etc for year be buying them from a distributor marshall by the hundred for pmp kit but order have drop to the point where we can no longer afford to offer this service and all of the distributor checked have some crazy minimum order 100 or so like to find a source for those still interested in building pmp kit any suggestion

 you be correct the fast    complete    image that could be present on tv would be one field which be 1 60 of a second approximately of course the phrase    tv screen    be often thrown around in reference to any crt display so perhaps this researcher use normal tv rate might even be a vector    strokewriter    display in which case the low limit on image time be anyone  s guess and be probably phosphor persistence limited
 an easy way to solve the problem be to use two op amps to form the balance low z output but this solution do not provide any galvanic isolation between keyboard or whatever plug and mixer if no tight requiremets be demand and some hum snap crackle and pop sound form by ground loop can be tolerate the op amp solution be just what you be look for it be cheap     somewhat 10 di box not sure but craig anderton do introduce one di box project in guitar player mag year ago transformerless        hope this help email if more detail want                                                                                                              heikki paananen heke stekt oulu fi the university of oulu department of electrical engineering  just a student finland

 i really know where to post this question so i figure that this board would be most appropriate i be wonder about those massive concrete cylinder that be ever present at nuclear poer site they look like cylinder that have be pinch in the middle do anybody know what the actual purpose of those thing be i hear that call  cooling tower but what the heck do they cool i hope someone can help                                  during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt when this happens the liquid uranium be pumped to the cool tower where it be sprayed into the air contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cool tower floor there it be collect by a cleaning crew use shop vac and be then reform into pellet for reactor use the next day cool tower be a lot taller than they really need to be power company be force to make them that tall by some enviromental law that require the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1 this law be now under attack by lawyer argue that the 1 should be measure at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cool tower eliminate this law will save power company thousand of dollar in concrete cost for new nuke
 this be definitely the wrong newsgroup for this but never mind any machine power by heat motor steam  or gasturbine steamengine thermoelement etc work the well the big the temperature difference between input and output be because you never get all thermic energy out of the power medium steam burning gaz etc you have to eliminate the rest of the energy to keep the efficency high a thermal electric power plant coal oil or atomic power work just the same way you heat water steam to power the turbine and generator because you get the whole energy out of the steam efficency be never 100 you have to cool down this steam again by something else most power plant use cool tower for this purpose some type of mega refrigerator     others use water of a river ecologically not unobjectionable get it cheer robert hb9nby

 lot more delete i think the hangup with digital scope be that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope by scope basis and some of the function be typically present in my opinion in a counter intuitive fashion hp have make some stride in their 54600 series imo automatic setup be fine for simple repetitive waveform but can give you some crazy result on more complex event where you need to understand how the scope be actually measuring processing the event for example be the scope in    equivalent time    or in    real time    sample mode equivalent time be a mode where sample be built up slowly by add a delay to the trigger event each sweep what be the scope  s actual sample rate at the time how be the data be massage after capture but before display etc one common misconception be the speed of the scope be the hp scope use really a 100 mhz scope or be it a 20 mhz sample rate scope  5 mhz single shot significance whose front end include s h can support 100 mhz waveform important for equivalent time sample the 100 mhz input in this case really only help you when your waveform be repetitive or on a single sample when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time so there be a lot more variable in understand how to get useful information from a digital scope i prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for event where i need storage for later analysis or comparison when the event be within the capability of the scope now for the price of true 100 mhz digital scope to fall                                                                                                              dave medin phone 205 730 3169 w ssd    networking 205 837 1174 h intergraph corp  m s gd3004 internet dtmedin catbyte b30 ingr com huntsville al 35894 uucp     uunet ingr b30 catbyte dtmedin         everywhere you look at least around my office

contact someone qualify    a license electrician or your local electrical inspector electricity be no joke mistake can result in shock fire or electrocution furthermore our discussion be base on the u s  national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of our ability we have confirm every detail with the electrical code but we quote section simply to keep this thing readable if you think wrong we invite you to correct u but please quote reference the nec and the cec do not in and of themselves have the force of law many municipality adopt it en toto others however do not check your with your local building department and provincial hydro inspection office in canada to find out what applies in your area also your local electrical utility may also have special requirement for electrical service installation bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family residence multi family dwelling mobile home commercial establishment etc  be sometimes govern by different rule also note that contrary to popular belief in the u s  and in some part of canada canada be not a wholly owned subsidiary of the u s  consequently the nec do not apply in canada lot of thing be the same include voltage line frequency and the law of physic but there be a number of crucial difference in the regulation where we can note them flag the relevant passage with    nec    or    cec    remember that the cec and nec be minimal standard it be often smart to go beyond their minimal requirement subject what be the nec where can i get a copy the nec be a model electrical code devise and publish by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group revise every three year the 1993 version have be release you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by call them directly at 800 344 3555  the code exists in several version there  s the full text which be fairly incomprehensible there  s an abridge edition which have only the section likely to apply to most house and there  s the nec handbook which contains the    authorize commentary    on the code a well a the full text the recommend version unfortunately there  s no handbook for the abridge edition and the full handbook be expensive    u 65 plus shipping and handle subject what be the cec where can i get a copy the canadian standard association be an organization make up of various government agency power utility insurance company electrical manufacturer and other organization the csa publishes csa standard c22 1 which be update every two or three year each province adopts with some amendment this standard and publishes a province specific code book since each province publishes it own slightly modify standard it would be somewhat confuse to obtain the csa standard itself in this faq    cec    really mean the appropriate provincial standard in particular this faq be derive from the ontario hydro electrical safety code 20th edition 1990 which be in turn base on csa c22 1 1990 16th edition while difference exist between the province an attempt have be make to avoid specific to ontario detail the appropriate provincial code can be obtain from electrical inspection office of your provincial power authority in ontario ontario hydro the ontario hydro book overly fat about c 25 and include mail update i hear that these standard be somewhat easy to read than the equivalent nec publication bother ask in quebec diy wiring be ban throughout the province subject can i do my own wiring extra pointer in most place homeowner be allow to do their own wiring in some not check with your local electrical inspector most place permit you to do wiring on other s home for money without a license nor be you permit to do wiring in    commercial    building multiple dwelling eg duplex be usually consider    semi commercial    or    commercial    however many jurisdiction will permit you to work on semi commercial wiring if supervise by a license electrician if you can find one willing to supervise if you do your own wiring an important point do it neat and well what you really want to aim for be a well job than an electrician will do after all your own home and you or your family that might get kill if you make a mistake an electrician have time pressure have the skill and know the trick of the trade to do a fast safe job in this faq consciously give a few recommendation that be in excess of code because we feel that reasonable and will impress the inspector the inspector will know that an amateur you have to earn his trust the best way of do this be to spend your time do a neat a job a possible cut corner exceed specification otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgression try to hide anything from the inspector use the proper tool ie use a bread knife to strip wire or twist wire with your finger the inspector like it and the result be that safe and it take longer and more likely to stick a hunk of 12ga wire through your hand that way handle house wire when very cold eg below  10c or 16f thermoplastic house wire particularly old type become very brittle subject what do i need in the way of tool first there  s the obvious    a hammer a drill a few screwdriver both straight and phillips head if lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csa approved device you need robertson    square recess    screwdriver 1 and 2 instead of phillips for drilling a few hole a 3 4    or 1    spade bit and 1 4    or 3 8    electric drill will do if do a lot or be work with elderly lumber we recommend a 1 2    drill right angle drill be wonderful can be rent and 3 4    or 1    screw point auger drill bit these bit pull you through so much faster and less fatigue even in 90 year old hardwood timber screw driver bit be useful for drill expecially if you install your electrical box use screw drywall screw work well for strip wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutter buy the 3 k mart    combo stripper crimper and bottle opener    type you should expect to pay 15 to 20 for a good    plier type    pair it will have size strip hole and nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with it one model have a small hole in the blade for form exact wire loop for screw terminal there be fancier type autostrip cut but they generally necessary and pro usually use them a pair of diagonal side cutter plier be useful for clip end in constrict place use these for strip wire you will need linesman plier for twist wire for wire nut you should have a pair of needle nose plier for fiddle inside box and closing loop but well to form wire loop with a    loop former hole    on your wire stripper more accurate if use non metallic cable get a cable stripper for remove the sheath or do what some pro do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of plier and simply rip the sheath back use the ground wire a a    zipper    and cut the sheath off you try to strip the sheath with a knife point because too easy to slash the insulation on the conductor apparently stanley utility knife fit with linoleum cutter hooked blade can be use to strip sheath but there be still the possibility that gouge the conductor for any substantial amount of work with armored cable well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter  us 18 hack saw be tricky to use without cut into the wire or the insulation three prong outlet tester be a quick check for properly wired outlet about 6 multimeters tell you more but be a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulate wire not supply any device be extremely helpful they cost about u 10 at radio shack you should have a voltage detector to check that the wire be dead before do work on them neon bulb version be cheap 2 3 and work well if you get more serious a    audible alarm    type be good for trace circuit without a helper though be know to lock the drill on and hit breaker until the scream stop for run wire through exist wall you need fish tape often two tape be need though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice fish tape can be rent electrical tape lot of it seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape the tape be useful for wrap dicy insulation in repair work another use be to wrap around the body of outlet and switch to cover the termination screw i do this but drywall contractor prefer it to prevent explosion when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that have no cover plate subject what be ul listing the ul stand for    underwriter laboratory    it use to be an insurance industry organization but now it be independent and non profit it test electrical component and equipment for potential hazard when something be ul listed that mean that the ul have test the device and it meet their requirement for safety ie fire or shock hazard it necessarily mean that the device actually do what suppose to just that it probably kill you the ul do not have power of law in the u s     you be permit to buy and install non ul listed device however insurance policy sometimes have clause in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim make in response to the failure of a non ul listed device furthermore in many situation the nec will require that a wiring component use for a specific purpose be ul listed for that purpose indirectly this mean that certain part of your wiring must be ul listed before an inspector will approve it and or occupancy permit issue subject what be csa approval every electrical device or component must be certify by the canadian standard association before it can be sell in canada implicit in this be that all wiring must be do with csa approved material they perform test similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approval be require by law again like the ul if a fire be cause by non csa approved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim in canada there be a branch organization of the ul call ulc ul of canada ulc do not have power of law and seem to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance company subject be there any cheaper easy to read book on wiring usa the follow three book be suggest by our reader residential wiring by jeff markell craftsman book carlsbad ca for 18 25 isbn 0 934041 19 9  practical electrical wiring residential farm and industrial base on the national electrical code ansi nfpa 70 herbert p  richter and w  creighton schwan mcgraw hill book co  wiring simplify h  p  richter and w  c  schwan park publishing co  try to make sure that the book be base on the late nec revision which be currently 1990  canada p s knight author and publishes a book call    electrical code simplify    there appear to be a version publish specific to each province and be very tie into the appropriate provincial code it focus on residential wiring and be indispensible for canadian diy ers it be well to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring or answer question on the net it be update each time the provincial code be this book be available at all diy and hardware store for less than c 10 subject inspection how and what why should i get my wiring inspect most jurisdiction require that you obtain a permit and inspection of any wiring that be do amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reason like insurance company not like to have to pay claim a permit and inspection provide some assurance that you your family your neighbor or subsequent owner of your home get kill or lose their home one night due to a sloppy wiring job most jurisdiction have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring do without a permit california for instance be particularly nasty about this if fire start in your home and un inspected wiring be at fault insurance company will often refuse to pay the damage claim in general the process go like this you apply to your local inspection office or building department for a permit you should have a sketch or detailed draw of what you plan on do this be a good time to ask question on any thing not sure of if do major work they may impose special condition on you require load calculation and ask other question at this point they will tell you which inspection you will need if instal a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connection inspect before your power utility will provide a connection this be sometimes do by the local power authority rather than the usual inspector after instal the box and wiring but before the insulation walls go up you will need a    rough in    inspection after the wall be up and the wiring be complete you will need a    final inspection    subject my house meet some of these rule and regulation do i have to upgrade in general there be no requirement to upgrade old dwelling though there be some exception ie smoke detector in some case however any new work must be do accord to the late electrical code also if you do    major    work you may be require to upgrade certain exist portion or all of your system check with your local electrical inspector subject a word on voltage 110 115 117 120 125 220 240 one thing where thing might get a bit confuse be the different number people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit one person might talk about 110v another 117v or another 120v these be all in fact exactly the same thing     in north america the utility company be require to supply a split phase 240 volt   5 feed to your house this work out a two 120v    5 leg additionally since there be resistive voltage drop in the house wiring not unreasonable to find 120v have drop to 110v or 240v have drop to 220v by the time the power reach a wall outlet especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run for a number of reason some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different number this faq have chosen to be consistent with call them    110v    and    220v    except when actually say what the measure voltage will be confuse a bit just ignore it one thing that might make this a little more understandable be that the nameplate on equipment ofen show the low ie 110v instead of 120v value what this implies be that the device be design to operate properly when the voltage drop that low 208v be  not  the same a 240v 208v be the voltage between phase of a 3 phase    y    circuit that be 120v from neutral to any hot 480v be the voltage between phase of a 3 phase    y    circuit 277v from hot to neutral in keep with 110v versus 120v strangeness motor intend to run on 480v three phase be often label a 440v     subject what do an electrical service look like there be logically four wire involve with supply the main panel with power three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire come from elsewhere the bare wire be connect to one or more long metal bar pound into the ground or to a wire bury in the foundation or sometimes to the water supply pipe have to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe enter the house watch out for galvanic action conductivity    break    often between copper and iron pipe this be the    ground conductor    it be there to make sure that the third prong on your outlet be connect to ground this wire normally carry no current one of the other wire will be white or black with white or yellow stripe or sometimes simply black it be the neutral wire it be connect to the    centre tap    cec    center tap    in the nec of the distribution transformer supply the power it be connect to the ground conductor in only one place often inside the panel the neutral and ground should not be connect anywhere else otherwise weird and or dangerous thing may happen furthermore there should only be one ground system in a home some code require more than one ground electrode these will be connect together or connect to the neutral at a common point still one ground system add additional ground electrode connect to other portion of the house wiring be unsafe and contrary to code if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral be usually brought a separate conductor from the main panel and be not connect together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral ground connection however in some situation certain category of separate building you actually do have to provide a second ground electrode consult your inspector the other two wire will usually be black and be the    hot    wire they be attach to the distribution transformer a well the two black wire be 180 degree out of phase with each other this mean if you connect something to both hot wire the voltage will be 220 volt if you connect something to the white and either of the two black you will get 110v some panel seem to only have three wire come into them this be either because the neutral and ground be connect together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire be do dual duty a both neutral and ground or in some rare occasion the service have only one hot wire 110v only service subject what be a circuit inside the panel connection be make to the incoming wire these connection be then use to supply power to select portion of the home there be three different combination 1 one hot one neutral and ground 110v circuit 2 two hots no neutral and ground 220v circuit 3 two hots neutral and ground 220v circuit neutral and or two 110v circuit with a common neutral 1 be use for most circuit supply receptacle and light within your house 3 be usually use for supply power to major appliance such a stove and dryer they often have need for both 220v and 110v or for bring several circuit from the panel box to a distribution point 2 be usually for special 220v motor circuit electric heater or air conditioner note in the u the nec frequently permit a circuit similar to 2 be use for stove and dryer namely that there be two hot wire and a wire that do dual duty a neutral and ground and be connect to the frame a well a provide the neutral for 110v purpose three prong plug instead of four  only  for stoves dryers connect to the main panel when connect to most sub panels 4 prong plug and receptacle be require in our not so humble opinion this be crazy but the nfpa claim that this practice be re evaluated for the 1992 nec and found to be safe check your local code or inquire a to local practice    there be restriction on when this be permissible 1 be usually wire with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for ground 2 and 3 have one hot wire colour red the other black a bare wire for ground and in 3 a white wire for neutral you will sometimes see 2 wire with just a black white and ground wire since the white be    hot    in this case both the nec and cec require that the white wire be    permanently marked    at the end to indicate that it be a live wire usually do with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape each circuit be attach to the main wire come into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there be in a few locale circuit that look like 1 2 or 3 except that they have two bare ground wire some place require this for hot tub and the like one ground be    frame ground    the other attache to the motor this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection subject    ground    versus    ground    versus    neutral    accord to the terminology in the cec and nec the    ground    conductor be for the safety ground i e  the green or bare wire the word    neutral    be reserve for the white when you have a circuit with more than one    hot    wire since the white wire be connect to neutral and the ground conductor inside the panel the proper term be    ground conductor    however the potential confusion between    ground conductor    and    ground conductor    can lead to potentially lethal mistake you should never use the bare wire a a    ground conductor    or white wire a the    ground conductor    even though they be connect together in the panel but not in subpanels subpanels be fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel usually in the trade and in common usage the word    neutral    be use for    ground conductor    this faq us    neutral    simply to avoid potential confusion we recommend that you use    neutral    too thus the white wire be always except in some light switch application neutral not ground subject what do a fuse or breaker do what be the difference fuse and circuit breaker be design to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe level for example if your toaster short out a fuse or breaker should    trip    protect the wiring in the wall from melt a such fuse and breaker be primarily intend to protect the wiring    ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself cause a fire fuse contain a narrow strip of metal which be design to melt safely when the current exceeds the rat value thereby interrupt the power to the circuit fuse trip relatively fast which can sometimes be a problem with motor which have large startup current surge for motor circuit you can use a    time delay    fuse one brand be    fusetron    which will avoid trip on momentary overload a fusetron look like a spring loaded fuse a fuse can only trip once then it must be replace breaker be fairly complicate mechanical device they usually consist of one spring load contact which be latch into position against another contact when the current flow through the device exceeds the rat value a bimetallic strip heat up and bend by bending it    trip    the latch and the spring pull the contact apart circuit breaker behave similarly to fusetrons that be they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overload than ordinary fuse with high overload they trip quickly breaker can be reset a finite number of time each time they trip or be thrown when the circuit be in use some arc take place which damage the contact thus breaker should not be use in place of switch unless they be specially list for the purpose neither fuse nor breaker    limit    the current per se a dead short on a circuit can cause hundred or sometimes even thousand of ampere to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage subject breaker i use fuse statistic show that fuse panel have a significantly high risk of cause a fire than breaker panel this be usually due to the fuse be loosely screw in or the contact corrode and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse be instal or the proverbial    replace the fuse with a penny    trick since breaker be more permanently instal and have well connection mechanism the risk of fire be considerably less fuse be prone to explode under extremely high overload when a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conduct path result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melt service wiring through fire in the electrical distribution transformer and have your house burn down breaker do this many jurisdiction particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panel in new installation the nec do permit new fuse panel in some rare circumstance require the special insert to    key    the fuseholder to specific size fuse some device notably certain large air conditioner require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel the fuse be there to protect the motor winding from overload check the label on the unit this be usually only on large permanently instal motor the installation instruction will tell you if you need one subject what size wire should i use for a 20 amp circuit use 12 gauge wire for a 15 amp circuit you can use 14 gauge wire in most locale for a long run though you should use the next large size wire to avoid voltage drop 12 gauge be only slightly more expensive than 14 gauge though stiffer and harder to work with here  s a quick table for normal situation go up a size for more than 100 foot run when the cable be in conduit or gang with other wire in a place where they dissipate heat easily gauge amp 14 15 12 20 10 30 8 40 6 65 we list big size because it start get very dependent on the application and precise wire type subject where do these number come from there be two consideration voltage drop and heat buildup the small the wire be the high the resistance be when the resistance be high the wire heat up more and there be more voltage drop in the wiring the former be why you need higher temperature insulation and or big wire for use in conduit the latter be why you should use large wire for long run neither effect be very significant over very short distance there be some very specific exception where use of small wire be allow the obvious one be the line cord on most lamp try this unless certain that your use fit one of those exception you can never go wrong by use large wire subject what do    14 2    mean this be use to describe the size and quantity of conductor in a cable the first number specifies the gauge the second the number of current carry conductor in the wire but remember there  s usually an extra ground wire    14 2    mean 14 gauge two insulate current carry wire plus bare ground  2 wire usually have a black white and bare ground wire sometimes the white be red instead for 220v circuit without neutral in the latter case the sheath be usually red too  3 wire usually have a black red white and bare ground wire usually carry 220v with neutral subject what be a    wirenut       marrette       marr connector    how be they use a wire nut be a cone shape thread plastic thingummy use to connect wire together    marrette    or    marr connector    be trade name usually use a lot of them in diy wiring in essence you strip the end of the wire about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on though some wirenuts advertise that you need to twist the wire do it anyways more mechanically and electrically secure there be many different size of wire nut you should check that the wire nut use be the correct size for the quantity and size of wire connect together just gimble the wire together with a pair of plier or your finger use a pair of blunt nose    linesman    plier and carefully twist the wire tightly and neatly sometimes a good idea to trim the result end to make sure it go in the wirenut properly some people wrap the    open    end of the wirenut with electrical tape this be probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an inspection usually do because a bit of bare wire be expose outside the wire nut instead of tap it the connection should be redone subject what be a gfi gfci a gfci be a    ground fault circuit interrupter    it measure the current current flow through the hot wire and the neutral wire if they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption be that current be leak to ground via some other path this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person any of these situation be hazardous so the gfci trip break the circuit gfcis do not protect against all kind of electric shock if for example you simultaneously touch the hot and neutral lead of a circuit and no part of you be ground a gfci help all of the current that pass from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keep the gfci happy the two pair of connection on a gfci outlet be not symmetric one be label load the other line the incoming power feed  must  be connect to the line side or the outlet will not be protect the load side can be use to protect all device downstream from it thus a whole string of outlet can be cover by a single gfci outlet subject where should gfcis be use the nec mandate gfcis for 110v 15a or 20a single phase outlet in bathroom kitchen within 6 of the sink garage unfinished basement or crawl space outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where likely to encounter water or dampness there be exception for inaccessible outlet those dedicate to appliance    occupy fix space    typically refrigerator and freezer and for sump pump and laundry appliance the cec do not mandate a many gfcis in particular there be no requirement to protect kitchen outlet or most garage or basement outlet basement outlet must be protect if you have a dirt floor garage outlet if near the door to outside bathroom and most exterior outlet must have gfcis even if you be not require to have gfci protection you may want to consider instal it anyway unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost be low in the u s  gfci outlet can cost a little a u 8 cost be a bit high in canada c 12 evaluate your own risk factor do your finish basement ever get wet do you have small child do you use your garage outlet to power outdoor tool do water or melt snow ever puddle inside your garage subject where i use a gfci gfcis be generally not use on circuit that a pose a safety risk and b be use to power equipment that must run unattended for long period of time refrigerator freezer and sump pump be good example the rationale be that gfcis be sometimes prone to nuisance trip some people claim that the inductive delay in motor winding can cause a momentary current imbalance trip the gfci note though that most gfci trip be real if get a lot of trip for no apparent reason be well advised to check your wiring before decide that the gfci be broken or useless subject what be the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker for most situation you can use either a gfci outlet a the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built in gfci the former be generally prefer since gfci breaker be quite expensive for example an ordinary ge breaker cost  us 5 the gfci model cost  us 35 there be one major exception if you need to protect a    multi wire branch circuit    two or more circuit share a common neutral wire such a a canadian style kitchen circuit need a multi pole gfci breaker unfortunately these be expensive the cost can range into the hundred of dollar depend on what brand of panel box you have but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice one more caveat    gfci outlet be bulky you may want to use an oversize box when instal them on second thought use large actually deep box everywhere thank yourself for it incidentally if instal a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet be protect such a a bathroom you really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anything upstream of it but protect the whole circuit be prefer when you install a gfci a good idea to use the little    ground fault protect    sticker that come with it and mark the outlet downstream of the gfci you can figure out which outlet be    downstream    simply by trip the gfci with the test button and see which outlet be dead subject what  s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then apart from their use in electronics which we comment on and for certain fluorescent light they turn on without a good ground connection intend to guard against insulation failure within the device generally the case of the appliance be connect to the ground lead if there  s an insulation failure that short the hot lead to the case the ground lead conduct the electricity away safely and possibly trip the circuit breaker in the process if the case be not ground and such a short occurs the case be live    and if you touch it while ground get zapped of course if the circuit be gfci protected it will be a very tiny zap    which be why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlet both nec and cec there be some appliance that should  never  be ground in particular that applies to toaster and anything else with expose conductor consider if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and not ground nothing will happen if slightly ground get a small shock the resistance will be too high but if the case be ground and you be hold it be the perfect path to ground     subject why be one prong wider than the other polarization nowadays many two prong device have one prong wider than the other this be so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire be neutral and the other hot this be particularly advantageous in light fixture where the the shell should neutral safety or other device which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radio most 2 prong extension cord have wide prong too this require that you wire your outlet and plug the right way around you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot most outlet have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter colour screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which be which by which prong the terminate screw connects to subject what kind of outlet do i need in a kitchen the nec require at least two 20 amp    small appliance circuit    for kitchen the cec require split duplex receptacle outlet must be instal such that no point be more than 24    nec 900 mm cec from an outlet every counter wider than 12    nec or 300 mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlet be on may not feed any outlet except in the kitchen pantry or din room furthermore these circuit be in addition to any require for refrigerator stove microwave light etc non dedicated outlet within 6 of a sink  must  be protect by a gfci nec only split duplex receptacle be fed with a 220v circuit the tab be broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot go to the upper outlet and the other hot go to the low outlet the neutral connects to both outlet through one screw when    carry through    to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that remove the outlet or have the neutral connection fall off cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlet subject where must outlet and switch be in bathroom there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporate in the light fixture all such outlet  must  be gfci protected subject what be romex nm nmd what be bx when should i use each romex be a brand name for a type of plastic insulate wire sometimes call non metallic sheath the formal name be nm this be suitable for use in dry protect area ie inside stud wall on the side of joist etc that be not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat most newer home be wire almost exclusively with nm wire there be several different category of nm cable bx cable    technically know a armored cable or    ac    have a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductor and be fairly resistant to damage teck cable be ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath protection for cable in conceal location where nm or ac cable be run through stud joist or similar wooden member the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm 1 25    cec nec from the edge of the wooden member or the cable should be protect from mechanical injury this latter protection can take the form of metal plate such a spare outlet box end or conduit note inspector permitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be use a the mechanical protection but this be technically illegal additional protection recommendation these be rule in the canadian code they be reasonable answer to the vague reference to    expose to mechanical damage    in both the nec and cec nm cable should be protect against mechanical damage where it pass through floor or on the surface of wall in expose location under 5 foot from the floor ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guard etc where cable be suspend a in connection to furnace or water heater the wire should be protect canadian practise be usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable or nm cable in flexible conduit to    jump    to the appliance staple nm to a piece of lumber be also sometimes use where nm cable be run in close proximity to heating duct or pipe heat transfer should be minimize by mean of a 25mm 1    air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglass nm cable shall be support within 300mm 1 of every box or fitting and at interval of no more than 1 5m 5 hole in joist or stud be consider    support    some slack in the cable should be provide adjacent to each box while fishing cable be technically in violation it be permit where    proper    support be impractical 2 conductor nm cable should never be staple on edge knight also insists on only one cable per staple refer to the    workmanship    clause but this seem more honour in the breach     cable should never be bury in plaster cement or similar finish cable should be protect where it run behind baseboard cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joist or the low edge of rafter where the headroom be more than 1m 39    whenever bx cable be terminate at a box with a clamp small plastic bushing must be insert in the end of the cable to prevent the clamp force the sharp end of the armor through the insulation bx be sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless cover by solid wall covering in place where damage be more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be require to use conduit a ul  or csa  approve metal pipe you use various type of fitting to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the wire service entrance frequently use a plastic conduit in damp place eg bury wiring to outdoor light you will need special wire eg cec nmw90 nec uf nmw90 look like very heavy duty nmd90 you will usually need short length of conduit where the wire enters exits the ground see underground wiring section thermoplastic sheath wire such a nm nmw etc should not be expose to direct sunlight unless explicitly approve for that purpose many electrical code do not permit the rout of wire through furnace duct include cold air return plenum construct by metal sheet enclose joist space the reason for this be that if there  s a fire the ducting will spread toxic gas from burning insulation very rapidly through the building teflon insulate wire be permit in plenum in many area canada appear to use similar wire designation to the u except that canadian wire designation usually include the temperature rating in celsius eg    ac90    versus    ac    in the u nm b be 90 degree celcius note local code vary this be one of the item that change most often eg chicago code require conduit  everywhere  there be very different requirement for mobile home check your local code  especially  if do anything the slightest out of the ordinary wire selection table incomplete the real table be enormous uncommon wire type or application omit condition type cec nec exposed concealed dry plastic nmd90 nm armor ac90 ac teck90 exposed concealed damp plastic

cable the box itself provide ground conductor continuity u s  plastic box use metal cable clamp the cec be slightly different the cec never permit cable armor a a ground conductor however you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath the cec also require ground of any metal cable clamp on plastic box the advantage of plastic box be comparatively minor even for non metallic sheathe cable    you can avoid make one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less on the other hand plastic box be more vulnerable to impact for expose or shop wiring metal box be probably well subject junction box position a junction box be a box use only for connect wire together junction box must be locate in such a way that accessible later ie not bury under plaster excessive use of junction box be often a sign of sloppy installation and inspector may get nasty subject can i install a replacement light fixture in general one can replace fixture freely subject to a few caveat first of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit if your heart be set on instal half a dozen 500 watt floodlight you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box but there be some more subtle constraint a well for example old house wiring have high temperature insulation the excess heat generate by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad result some newer fixture be specifically marked for high temperature wire only you may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already have this problem in which case replace any device be a real adventure other concern include provide a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixture and make sure that the ceiling box and it mount be strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan you may need to install a new box specifically list for this purpose a 2x4 across the ceiling joist make a good support metal bracket be also available that can be fish into ceiling thru the junction box hole and mount between the joist there be special rule for recess light fixture such a    pot    lamp or heat lamp when these be instal in insulate ceiling they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provide for the installation of pot lamp in insulate ceiling provide that the fixture be boxed in a    coffin    usually 8 x16    x12    make by make a pair of joist 12    high and cover with plywood that have any insulation yes 8  feet  long nec rule be somewhat less stringent they require at least 3    clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rule also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which mean that a cec style    coffin    might be worthwhile presumably up to the local inspector the cec actually mandate the coffin per se this seem to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture get accidentally bury in insulation ie if you have insulation blown in later there be now fixture that contain integral thermal cutout and fairly large case that can be bury directly in insulation they be usually limited to 75 watt bulb and be unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the old type before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such us follow the installation instruction carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary there do not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that be approve for use in insulation the    coffin    appear the only legal approach subject what do it mean when the light brighten when a motor start this usually mean that the neutral wire in the panel be loose depend on the load balance one hot wire may end up be more than 110v and the other less than 110v with respect to ground this be a very hazardous situation it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fire and in some situation electrocute you ie some u jurisdiction require the stove frame connect to neutral if this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem note a brief 1 second brightening be sometimes normal with light and motor on the same 220v with neutral circuit a loose main panel neutral will usually show increase brightness far longer than one second in case of doubt get help subject what be 3 phase power should i use it can i get it in my house three phase power have three    hot    wire 120 degree out of phase with each other these be usually use for large motor because it be more    efficient    provide a bit more start torque and because the motor be simpler and hence cheaper most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that show 110 volt between any hot and ground and 208 volt between any two hots the latter show the difference between a normal 220v 110v common neutral circuit which be 240 volt between the two hots there be 3 phase circuit with different voltage bring in a 3 phase feed to your house be usually ridiculously expensive or impossible if the equipment you want to run have a standard motor mount it be  much  cheaper to buy a new 110v or 220v motor for it in some case it be possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a    capacitor start    unit or use a large motor a a auto  generator these be tricky but be a good solution if the motor be non standard size or too expensive or too big to replace the taunton press book    the small shop    have an article on how to do this if you must note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by use such a converter the law of thermodynamics guarantee that subject be it well to run motor at 110 or 220 theoretically it make any difference however there be a difference be the amount of power lose in the supply wiring all thing be equal a 220v motor will lose 4 time less power in the house wiring than a 110v motor this also mean that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker and in some circumstance the small power loss will lead to longer motor life this be usually irrelevant unless the supply wire be more than 50 foot long subject what be this nonsense about 3hp on 110v 15a circuit it be a universal physical law that 1 hp be equal to 746 watt give heating loss power factor and other inefficiency it be usually best to consider 1 hp be go to need 1000 1200 watt a 110v 15a circuit can only deliver 1850 watt to a motor so it can not possibly be more than approximately 2 hp give rational efficiency factor 1 5hp be more like it some equipment manufacturer sears in particular most router manufacturer in general advertise a hp rating that be far in excess of what be possible they be give you a    stall horsepower    or similar that mean the power be measure when the motor be just about to stop turn because of the load what they mention be that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few second hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt    draw far more current than it can continuously when compare motor compare the continuous horsepower this should be on the motor nameplate if you find that figure check the amperage rating which be always present subject how do i convert two prong receptacle to three prong old home frequently have two prong receptacle instead of the more modern three these receptacle have no safety ground and the cable usually have no ground wire neither the nec or cec permit instal new 2 prong receptacle anymore there be several different approach to solve this 1 if the wiring be do through conduit or bx and the conduit be continuous back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box nec mainly cec frown on this practise 2 if there be a copper cold water pipe go nearby and continuous to the main house ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong 3 run a ground conductor back to the main panel 4 easy install a gfci receptacle the ground lug should not be connect to anything but the gfci protection itself will serve instead the gfci will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlet if you do this to protect downstream outlet the ground must not be connect together since it be connect to a real ground a wiring fault could energize the case of 3 prong device connect to other outlet be sure though that there indirect ground plug connection such a via the sheath on bx cable the cec permit you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a non conducting goop like caulk compound this be not permit in the nec subject be you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlet should the test button work sure about what the nec and cec say remember though that your local code may vary a for the test button    there s a resistor connect the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button current through this resistor show up a an imbalance and trip the gfci this be a simple passive and reliable test and require a real ground to work if your gfci do not trip when you press the test button it be very probably defective or miswired again if the test button work something  s broken and potentially dangerous the problem should be correct immediately the instruction that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connect we do not know why they say this the cause may be a mundane a an old instruction sheet or with the formality of ul or csa listing    perhaps the device be never test without the ground wire be connect on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have be grant if the device behaves properly in  all  list application include ungrounded outlet replacement one of u call leviton their gfcis be label for installation on ground circuit only the technician be surprised to see that he agree that the nec do not require it and promise to investigate subject how should i wire my shop a with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all device that will be on simultaneously the code specifies that you should stay under 80 of the nominal capacity of the circuit for typical home shop use this mean one circuit for the major power tool and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac use at least 12 gauge wire    many power tool have big motor with a big start up surge if you can use 20 amp breaker nec though cec require standard 20a receptacle which mean have to    replug    all your equipment light should either be on a circuit of their own    and not share with circuit in the rest of the house    or be on at least two separate circuit the idea be that you want to avoid a situation where a blade be still spin at several thousand rpm while grope in the dark for the off switch do install lot of outlet easy to install them in the begin when you have to cut into an exist cable useful if at least two circuit be accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time a the tool you really want but use metal box and plate and maybe even metal sheathed cable you may have object fly around at high speed if something go a bit wrong note that some jurisdiction have a    no horizontal wiring    rule in workshop or other unfinished area that be use for work what this mean be that all wiring must be run along structural member ie staple to stud other possible shop circuit include heater circuit 220v circuit for some large tool and air compressor circuit overload circuit and use extension cord if you can help it unless rat for high current a coil extension cord be not a safe a a straight length of wire of the same gauge also the insulation withstand a much heat and heat dissipation be the critical issue if your shop be locate at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it if you have young child you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switch to    safe    particular circuit make sure you get one rat high enough for example ordinary light switch be not safely able to handle the start up surge generate by a table saw buy    horsepower rated    switch instead finally note that most home shop be in garage or unfinished basement hence the nec requirement for gfcis apply and even if you    know    that never use one of your shop outlet to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea note fine woodworking magazine often carry article on shop wiring april 1992 be one place to start subject underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specification use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tube and possibly lumber use creosote lumber it rot thermoplastic insulation and act a a catalyst in the corrosion of lead the transition from in house to underground wire be generally via conduit all outdoor box must be specifically list for the purpose and contain the appropriate gasket fitting etc if the location of the box be subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box be need and of course forget the gfcis the require depth and other detail vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that say    bury power line    and bury it a few inch above where the wire have be place subject aluminum wiring during the 1970  s aluminum instead of copper wiring become quite popular and be extensively use since that time aluminum wiring have be implicate in a number of house fire and most jurisdiction no longer permit it in new installation we recommend even if allow to that do not use it for new wiring but panic if your house have aluminum wiring aluminum wiring when properly instal can be just a safe a copper aluminum wiring be however very unforgiving of improper installation we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problem and what you can do to make your wiring safe the main problem with aluminum wiring be a phenomenon know a    cold creep    when aluminum wiring warms up it expands when it cool down it contract unlike copper when aluminum go through a number of warm cool cycle it loses a bit of tightness each time to make the problem bad aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain type of metal so the resistance of the connection go up which cause it to heat up and corrode  oxidize still more eventually the wire may start get very hot melt the insulation or fixture attach to and possibly even cause a fire since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 70  s we will cover basic point of safe aluminum wiring we suggest that if consider purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discover it later that you hire a license electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the follow thing 1 fixture eg outlet and switch directly attach to aluminum wiring should be rat for it the device will be stamp with    al cu    or    co alr    the latter supersedes the former but both be safe these fixture be somewhat more expensive than the ordinary one 2 wire should be properly connect at least 3 4 way around the screw in a clockwise direction connection should be tight while repeat tighten of the screw can make the problem bad during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection note that aluminum wiring be still often use for the main service entrance cable it should be inspect 3    push in    terminal be an extreme hazard with aluminum wire any connection use push in terminal should be redone with the proper screw connection immediately 4 there should be no sign of overheat darken connection melt insulation or    bake    fixture any such damage should be repair 5 connection between aluminum and copper wire need to be handle specially current canadian code require that the wire nut use must be specially marked for connect aluminum to copper the nec require that the wire be connect together use special crimp device with an anti oxidant grease the tool and material for the latter be quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool 6 any non rated receptacle can be connect to aluminum wiring by mean of a short copper    pigtail    see 5 above 7 show reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly strip not nicked wire etc if when consider purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring show no problem or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe if there be sign of problem in many place we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong receptacle be use you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtail have this professionally do can range from 3 to 10 per receptacle switch you can do this yourself too subject buying a house what should i do congratulation but     generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural a well if an inspection of the wiring show no problem or only one or two minor one we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problem be fix if there be sign of problem in many place we suggest you look elsewhere here  s some hint on what to look for obvious non code wiring can include zip cord wiring either conceal or nail to wall hot wiring on the identify neutral conductor without proper mark ungrounded ground outlet except when downstream of a gfci splice hang in mid air other than proper knob and tube switch neutral unsecured romex swing about like grapevine certain wiring practises that be actually to code or be at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violation switch that seem to control nothing abandon perhaps not properly terminate wiring a wall switch that shuts off a group of light that be separately control by other wall switch except when  really  convenient switch and outlet in bizarre location great number of junction box without outlet or lamp junction box with great number of wire go into them wiring that pass through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling backwrapped ground wire subject what be this weird stuff old style wiring in the year since edison    invent    electricity several different wiring    style    have come and go when you buy an old home you may encounter some of this stuff this section describes the old method and some of their idiosyncrasy the old wiring system likely to encounter be call    knob and tube    k t it be make up of individual conductor with a cloth insulation the wire be run along side structural member eg joist or stud use ceramic stand offs knob wire be run through structural member use ceramic tube connection be make by twist the wire together solder and wrap with tape since the hot and neutral be run separately the wiring tends to be rather confuse a neutral often run down the centre of each room with    tap    off to each fixture the hot wire tend to run from one fixture to the next in some case k t colour coded so the neutral be often the same colour a the hot wire see k t in home built a late a the 40  s comment on k t the people instal k t be pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good the wire insulation and insulator tend to stand up very well most k t see for example be in quite good condition no ground ground be usually difficult to install box be small receptacle replacement particularly with gfci can be difficult no bushing on box either so wiring change need special attention to box entry sometimes the neutral balance very well between separately hot circuit so it be sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceed the fuse on any circuit building code do not permit insulation in wall that contain k t connection to exist k t from new circuit can be tricky consult your inspector modern wiring practise require considerably more outlet to be instal than k t system do since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally necessary to replace it simply because k t what you should watch out for be renovation that have interfere with it and be cautious about circuit load in many case perfectly reasonable to leave exist k t alone and add new fixture on new circuit use modern technique after k t they invent multi conductor cable the first type you will see be roughly a cloth and varnish insulation it look much like the romex cable of the last decade or two this stuff be use in the 40  s and 50  s again no ground conductor it be instal much like modern wiring it major drawback be that this type of insulation embrittles see whole system where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch bx cable of the same vintage have similar problem this stuff be very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wire become bare this wiring should be left untouched a much a possible whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrate fight with electrical tape or heat shrink tube after this wiring technique the more modern romex be invent almost a asphalt impregnate cloth often a bit sticky this stuff stand up reasonably well and present a hazard and be reasonably easy to work with it do not need to be replace it should be consider a safe a the    modern    stuff thermoplastic insulation wire just abuse it too much subject where do i buy stuff try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you their price will often be considerably well than chain hardware store or diy centre have well quality material have wider variety include the    odd    stuff and have people behind the counter that know what talk about cultivate friendly knowledgeable sale people give you much valuable information

 there have be quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and ground practice here a few point need to be clarify the equipment ground conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring method be use a a safety ground to carry fault current back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal object it should never except for a few exception to be discuss later carry the normal operating current of a connect load some equipment have filter in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the ground conductor much communication or audio equipment be sensitive to noise or slight voltage on the ground conductor and may require special wiring of the ground conductor to provide reliable operation    orange    outlet be often use for this with insulate ground conductor wire back to the panel box and in many case back to the service anyone instal such a system should read both the section on ground in the national electric code and publication on instal quiet isolated ground system the code require the insulate ground conductor green wire to run with the current carry conductor back to the panel box and if require back all the way to the service entrance where it be bond to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these system be instal illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the ground conductor of a circuit often call the neutral which be refer to in the code a the    identify    conductor and be suppose to be white or natural grey this conductor be suppose to be connect to ground in most electrical system at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection be through the main bonding jumper in many household service panel the main bonding jumper be actually a bonding screw which attache the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the ground conductor neutral be generally a current carry conductor in the case of a 120 volt circuit it be one of the two conductor complete the circuit from the panel to the load device since the ground conductor neutral be only connect to the ground conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load be any distance from the service and draw any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the ground and ground conductor at the load under normal operating condition if you should incorrectly connect the ground neutral conductor to the ground conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the ground conductor since there will now be current flow through the ground conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment have a metal case which be connect to the ground conductor through the    u    ground plug the metal case be now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit condition may be only a few tenth of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally do not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the ground equipment come into contact with an independently ground object such a a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact be not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong condition this arc could start a fire it be possible in some case that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size cause it to overheat with the incorrect non single point ground of the neutral if there be a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much high voltage on the ground conductor which increase the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system be see a noise bu computer or audio equipment often cause malfunction i have spent some hour track down such short in technical facility where they be induce severe hum into equipment the neutral be usually bond to the ground at the distribution transformer a well a at the service entrance of each dwell this be do primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning current have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the current drawn by short to ground object like pipe draw enough current to trip circuit breaker or blow fuse quickly the bad side of this be that not all the neutral current from the dwell go through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flow through the ground electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipe and possibly in thing like underground fuel oil tank and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic field due to the large loop between the    hot    conductor in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there be those who feel these field may be unhealthy flame me on this just tell you where the field come from not health effect a far a concerned the jury be still out on this note that the bonding jumper be only instal at the main panel not at any sub distribution panel this be one reason why it be illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath use a a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulate conductor for the neutral the sheath can be use in this application only a the ground conductor if the neutral be bond to the ground conductor in the sub panel say by forget to remove the bonding screw all the ground conductor of the load on that panel will be above ground with the possible problem list above the code make exception for range and dryer a well a feed from one building to another in the case of the range and dryer the neutral may be use a the equipment ground under certain condition instead of a seperate wire every time the code be revise these exception come up for review these exception be in fact the first require safety ground in the day before u ground outlet and such the appliance manufacturer want to have to redesign their range and drier and the contractor want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wire in place of three wire to the appliance no question it would be safer with seperate neutral to the stove but the neutral current be low for most burner setting since most current be in the 220 volt    hots    except at some low setting the wire be large gauge and there be few report case of injury or damage so far the exception have survive in the case of feed between building primarily for lightning protection people do wiring should be aware what be and what a legal ground conductor obviously the bare wire in    romex     with ground be anywhere there be a green wire instal such a in a portable cord that be a good ground conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connector in metal box be a legal ground conductor in the u bx have an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to low the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the end you have to bond it to anything it do it job by touch every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tube be generally a legal ground conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for large pipe    greenfield    look like big bx but you pull your own wire in the empty sheath after you run it be not a legal ground conductor a it have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel have too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green ground conductor inside the greenfield    wiremold    be also not a legal ground conductor a the paint on the box often prevents good contact and the    feed    to the wiremold extension be often from a box in the wall that may not be well connect to the first wiremold box i have personally discover case where the entire run of wiremold and the case of everything plug into all the outlet on the run be    hot    with 120 volt why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there be no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlet have short to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlet at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can    bond    the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlet when ever there be a place to ground them it be legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground be available it be well to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you install it the interrupter depend on the ground to trip it be desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground be connect the interrupter will trip a soon a a faulty device be plug in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provide a ground path for those question the legal use of ungrounded gcfi  s read in the nec 210 7 d exception this be the 1990 code my  93 code be in the city but i know the rule change it might be renumbered though we have only touch the surface concern ground there be much more to this subject but most of you have fall asleep by now john

 ham can legally run up to 1500 watt it be very unlikely however that a ham would be run that kind of power from a car ham rig for car put out around 100 watt it be possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 foot away most tv stereo and vcr have very poor rf shield if you experience the problem frequently it may be cause by a ham cber or other radio operator in a base station nearby the interference may have be cause by a radio transmitter use for other purpose such a police fire etc if you heard voice over your stereo i think you be correct in assume that the source be an rf transmitter if you have frequent trouble you may want to try the rf ferrite choke available at radio shack the interference be probably be picked up by your speaker wire and those choke can be instal on the wire very easily without cut them good instruction be include with the choke if that do not solve the problem you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator look for antenna on the roof or car talk to him her about your problem there be thing a radio operator can do to reduce interference

 a method which will directly almost provide you with the information that you require be that which be commonly use for coordinate measurement of human body landmark eg the selspot system by selspot ab sweden and the watsmart system these use lateral photoeffect detector lindholm and oberg 1974 woltring and marsolais 1980 to determine the position of a spot of light project use a camera lens over it surface in escence the detector be a large photodiode with four cathode one on each of the four side of the square detector crystal and a single anode the back of the crystal a spot of light will produce current which be proportional to the position of the spot on the detector  s face let  s try some ascii graphic in 2 d so the detector have two cathode to detect linear position                                     1           cathode 1 xxxxx ________  xxxxx           light xxxxx    _____ divider __ output xxxxx           xxxxx              xxxxx  ________  1 2 xxxxx     gnd xxxxx     xxxxx  anode xxxxx       cathode 2                                        2 if the dot of light from the lead be the only source of light then the position of the projection be give by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina  tion the divider be use to normalize relative to total receive power when this circuit be use in the presence of other source of light then the way of    tune    to it be to sample for a few msec the background signal light the lead for an equal time and sample that signal separately the difference between the two be the position of the lead hamamatsu photonics sell linear and 2 d lateral photoeffect detector and they also sell the require signal processing electronics the ready made system by selspot and others be not cheap     lindholm l e  and k e oberg    an optoelectronic instrument for remote on line movement monitoring    biotelemetry 1 94 95 1974  woltring h j  and e b marsolais    opto electronic selspot gait measure  ments in two and three dimensional space a preliminary report    bull pros  thetics research 46 52 1980  most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate measurement than you need but i think that it simplicity beat scan a quadrant detector with a pan tilt system until you reach zero difference david

 thanks for the resposes a they be all good idea and i be look at use a couple of the idea i recieved in the mail today the spec sheet on the mil spec version of exar  s xr 2240 timer counter chip it be stable down to  50 c and suck very little power they show an application for a ultra long time delay up to several year depend on the rc time constant in this application they have two of them cascade together the reset and trigger pin of both chip be tie together and the timebase of the second chip be disabled in this configuration the output be high when the system be reset when trigger the output go low and stay that way for a total of 65 536 x the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chip can be programmed from to 256 x r x c to 65 536 x r x c in 256 step by select any combination of the counter output to the timer output the beauty of it be the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uf timing cap and a 391k resistor for 39 1 second per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of 2 562 457 6 second between timing cycle 39 1 x 65 536 or about 29 day of course much more than i need 14 day but the counter allows for 256 binary step that can be select for the output for the  pellet puker after the first 14 day and it trip it would reset it self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth power be still a problem though a few idea that you suggest be to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow a an insulator and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimate snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea this thing have to work for at least six week for three sample and the gas valve be 12 volt to spit the pellet out onto the snow anyway i order the xr 2240  s to see what i can do with them should be interest a long a not the one that have to go dig up the pellet in the middle of antartica freeze my bun off thanks again everyone

 might be a good idea     the resolution you request be about 0 3mv in order to get what paid for noise level well be low than that it be kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a pc before you pay for a pc card test it out by sample a low distortion sine wave i think there be a sine wave on a cd digital domain there be possibly other low thd source run the digitize waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum should give you a good indication of the design what i be do to test a data acquistion system i have design i get the idea from maxim data sheet if you can live with 14 bit resolution i would recommend look at the max121 from maxim it be a high speed 308khz complete sample a d with dsp interface the input range be     5v and it us a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source the analog design guide i get from them show a  100db noise level they claim a  77db max  85 typ thd look pretty good for the 12 1000 piece a evaluation kit be available might want to give these nice folk a call 1 800 998 8800 or fax 408 737 7194 and 408 737 7600 ext4000 for application assistance this assumes that you can build your own da and write your own software hey you can get the max121 a a free sample just by call the 1 800 i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by look at the noise level otherwise you might be throw out your money k  c  lee elec eng grad student

 not accord to the nec nor the cec a explain in the electrical wiring faq which i post here separately note the material under the heading and of course a they say       local code may vary    not sure about this if the ground connection on the outlet be connect to anything they should be connect to a wire that run back to the main panel where it be bond to the neutral connector and to the house ground rod a connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of the goal of the ground wire which be that if a short develops from hot to the ground wire enough current would flow to trip the breaker hmmm how be those orange    isolated ground    outlet often use in computer room wire

 with relay alone you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn on or off any channel if you want to hear the transient use some other device a photoresistor output optoisolator be the usual sort of thing to gently mute the signal then switch then remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator it use to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switch audio because the photoresistor time delay a few thousandth of a second kept any noise in the digital side which drive the lamp from contaminate the audio and the device be cheaper than relay
 i live in the san francisco bay area and word have it that something similar be on it way here since we apparently have the sensor base you folk have instal camera at strategic point along the freeway initial test be go to be in the santa clara area told with the video be piped into a command center building somewhere in the east bay not sure if frame grabber or cheap labor will be use to interpret the data but large multi colored status display will show the various route use different color to represent the various average speed for each stretch of highway an announcer will sit in front of the status  wall and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it apparently also look into licensing a low am frequency to be dedicate to provide continuous audio from this system in the mean time set up large incandescent display board along the test stretch to provide commuter with data on traffic condition up ahead my understand be that the system be subsidize a a pilot program and information from it will be available free of charge perhaps the la system be similarly free or provide at an obviously subsidize rate read    cheap    we also have the traffic report that be broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channel 2 and 36  these be verbal report qualify with a identification tone to tell in vehicle receiver like the  auto talk that the information come next be applicable to a give area in la probably use some other tv channel but the concept be the same try set your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel and go station jumping to find out which one be broadcasting this information i believe this program be also subsidize make the in vehicle receiver cheap to purchase and without have to incur monthly fee to use it since the maker of these in vehicle receiver have to pay for the broadcast this may not be completely true they likely have no investment in keep the system up and run when the cal trans stuff hit the airwave you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car nothing more when this happens perhaps a word to the wise     i think all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the la system be networked and paid for

 do anybody know if there be a mail list or newsgroup for power system and related area thanks
 this be indeed one function but more sophisticated one do level control and ground lift separate the keyboard and mixer earth aswell simple one be just that a transformer a decent quality audio trans  former will cost most of that 50 they be wire thus     hot                                              hot    input from    balance out to mixer keyboard                            cold gnd                                                    gnd the ground lift switch disconnect the gnd line from the mixer the transformer ratio depends on the precise application but around 10 1 turn ratio may be a good place to start christopher
 dec do this on their new alpha chip sure you could call them up and ask them how they do it haha actually there be some detail in their article in ieee journal of solid state circuit i think it be sometime around nov  1992
 if the set be direct line power try check the likely to be there hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt supply several set look at use a 135 volt regulator the regulator have a tendency to short out make the safety circuit shut down the eht supply section try put the set on a variac or adjustable transformer and low the ac input voltage to the set to about 90 volt if the set operates nromally then you know get a short regulator there be myriad other area for problem but see the one above several time also if the set us one the trippler module may be shot fairly common

 i have a bel 966 i just look at the manual yesterday     and it do indeed claim to be undetectable by rdd  s
 they require two separate ground one ground go to the ground pin of the outlet and the other ground wire be connect to the outlet s mount tab and thus ground the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate if any the box faceplate ground go to the normal distribution panel ground the outlet ground pin wire be generally connect to an insulate busbar in the distribution panel which be in turn connect to the building entrance main ground by it own wire
 the casio 7500 lectric diary have a 3 wire serial interface with param set like rs232 for which one get a magic but expensive cable to connect to a pc do anyone know the spec of this interface e g  it need invert and boost from cmos signal to match rs232 line
 be there a typical component or set of component that be at fault when a switch mode power supply go south the supply be for a disk drive any general hint would be appreciate thanks mark tarbell suite com at fault when a switch mode power supply go south the supply be for a disk drive any general hint would be appreciate
 may i respectfully suggest you not do this the ground be suppose to be a protective ground and though what you suggest look good on paper dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection it  d never meet code and if you now own the property and later sell it you may end up with liability you want and if you __ now own it well
 the best info i have see so far be the article    joystick metric measure physical property through the pc  s joystick port    by michael covington in the may 1985 issue of pc tech journal it talk about how to read all kind of thing voltage current resistance in basic and even include code for a simple    oscilloscope    display possible to read the joystick port directly if you want to use basic the detailed information for this be in the pc technical reference under option and adapter you have to provide some millisecond resolution timing function but a subject which have appear many time in article from dr  dobb  s circuit cellar ink etc look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive good luck

    i just instal a motorola xc68882rc50 fpu in an amiga a2630 board 25 mhz    68030 68882 with capability to clock the fpu separately previously    a mc68882rc25 be instal and everything be work perfectly now the    system display a yellow screen indicate a exception when it check for    the presence type of fpu when i reinstall an mc68882rc25 the system work    fine but with the xc68882 even at 25 mhz it do not work the designer    of the board mention that put a pullup resistor on data_strobe 470 ohm    might help but that change anything do anybody have some    suggestion what i could do do this look like a cpu fpu communication    problem or be the particular chip dead it be a pull not new    moreover the place i bought it from be send me an xc68882rc33 i thought    that the 68882rc33 be label mc not xc for not finalize mask design    be there any mc68882rc33       thanks    christian    have you change the crystal that clock for the fpu if you then it work
 see several reference to split  or separate beam radar which i claimed exist get ta eat some crow here i aware of them all i really knew be that it can be do with one beam i believe the rest of what i say be accurate though
 my impression    not an area played with much    be that the much beloved ne567 be basically obsolete if you want to detect a 1khz tone set a switched capacitor filter chip to that frequency feed your input to it and see if anything come out the other end the ne567 be what you use when good clean bandpass filter be hard to do nowadays easy and the result be well
 i be just wonder one thing actually two i hope that this be the proper place to post this subject why do a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when store on a concrete floor i decide to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year  to preserve them  and i just go to use them and notice that not only do they not work but they act like the two terminal be short i ask a friend and he say that you should never do that  cause it ruin them but he tell me why
 here  s a rough sketch of how the system work a reference station with a very exactly know position computes the error in the incoming gps signal these error be due to several factor include atmospheric distortion sa selective availability time dither etc the reference unit contains complex computational equipment to    back out    the error in it position since it know where it be already it then transmits these correction on a broadcast which be available to any number of relatively local receiver if the receiver be nearby 300km and be use the same satellite a the reference unit the error should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit thus the receiver unit may apply the correction calculate by the reference unit the u coast guard be currently a far a i know instal a series of coastline transmitter for differential gps these station will use exist radio tower i believe the frequency be to be approximately 305 khz there be many other private corporation offering dgps signal on different frequency for example pinpoint 310  618 7076 offer correction signal and receiver unit use an fm broadcast system which have station all across the u the correction code be usually transmit use the rtcm 104 format advertised accuracy espouse 1 to 5 meter error                                                                                                             john p  baker my opinion be my own i know john hopkins university anyone else who want them anyway apply physic laboratory laurel md 20723 bakerjp1 aplcomm jhuapl edu
 thus a decibell deci  l  tenth of bell be a fractional part of the original bell for example southwestern bell be a decibell and the measure of current amp be actually name after both the amp company and the amphenol company both company revolutionize electronics by simulatenously realize that the performance of connector and socket be affected by the amount of current run through the wire the ohmite company be the first to characterize resistance by number thus our use of the ohm     alexander graham bell actually be where bell come from     actually bel refers

 it sound like your tv be one of the one that also reacts to the video protection poor you the macroscrubber from radio electronics remove the protection so you sould n t have any more problem however if you use the method of copying it from one vcr to another where the second vcr react to the protection you will end up with a duplicate tape include the protection one thought come to mind about your problem     when play the tape for view be you feed the signal from the source vcr through an extra device before go to the tv if you feed it through a second vcr first that be your problem a to other device such a converter i know if they would react or not just to be safe you might want to make sure that you have nothing between the vcr and tv

 unfortunately wrong on both count the most common method of implement a tunable receiver be to have a local oscillator the local oscillator  s frequency can be radiate out of the receiver via the antenna unless the circuit be design and construct with great care for a reference on detect radio get the paperback book _spy catcher_ the author discover how to detect radio receiver from their local oscillator emission back in the  1950s  while he work for british intelligence  greg

 i have never work with really small signal before and have a few question about low level noise i have notice that the waveform synthesizer that i be use analogic 2020 have some relatively large common mode noise on it i be use this synthesizer to  null out another transient waveform and be amplify the difference  200uv several hundred time the 2020 have about 1 3 mvp p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurement hard to repeat the noise be not quite in sync with line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component be about 64hz how can i get rid of the noise when i look at the spectrum use an hp 3582a audio range analyzer the noise go away the minute i switch to  isolation on the input i be guess the anlayzer have a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to dc
 start to look at some device do serial data transmission over fairly decent distance in fairly noisy environment and have see a variety of scheme for protect the rs232 transceivers and the rest of the circuit from transient on the serial line left wonder what be the best way of do this how necessary be it stuff delete what be the wisdom on this out there ta martin from what i know protection be necessary esp if you plan to route the cable into an unknown environment out of your control thing like accidental short between the signal line and power cable or even lightning strike be very likely and i think you like to see the sight of your computer go up in smoke even ethernet card be protect look at the one in my pc and the connector be protect by a gas discharge tube but if you plan to use the serial cable for internal routings i e in control environment it should be reasonably safe not to have them suggestion look in the r data book they have several rs232 transceivers that have overvoltage protection among them include the lt1080 lt1081 and max250 and max251 the maxim be suppose to be electrically isolated one but still need opto isolators to work ask me why never use them before another alternative be an rs232 surge protector two be list in the r catalogue if you need additional info i e stock no just e mail me

 not up on the detail of u patent law but i think this be incorrect there be a    reasonable use    exemption for  copyright  there be none for  patents  the exemption from patent licensing be quite narrow r d work be exempt but personal use be not that be okay to experiment with a patent idea but not to put it to practical use e g to improve your stereo even if only your own private practical use of course it be unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detect or that you will ever be sue over it
 be there a fast n dirty way to kill the line spike that occurs when an inductive load be turn on sometime other than at zero crossing of the ac cycle a capacitor kludged in somehow etc get a microcontroller that be run a bunch of valve and pump in a big instrument washer and almost everything be be switch with zero crossing solid state relay so that stuff stay    quiet    ac wise but there  s one steam valve that get turn on by a mechanical relay in the water tank fill thermostat system and not under control of my ssrs and it do sometimes generate radiate a spike that reset one of my peripheral chip my software time out and try again but love to just tack in a magic spike killing fix that would avoid have to do some major rewiring redesign a varistor would help but might not be sufficient idea

 no expert at ups  s but you say something that make it sound like you realize something on a typical ups well on ours anyway there be no switchover from ac to dc all the protect equipment be always run from the battery via an inverter with the usual condition of also have them on charge if the power fails big deal the computer never see it until the battery start to droop but there  s something like 60 car sized battery in that cabinet so it take a while if you be gon na run the gut on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time then there  d be no switchover to screw thing up and no have to sense the failure fast just keep the dc on charge when the power be on and it  ll be there in zero time when you    need    it

 hi be a electronic engineering student with only electronic ii under my belt i find myself  needing  to build a moderate wattage audio amp so i  ll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the  net please explain how watt be calculate in audio amp circuit no not p i e just how it relates to one of the follow ai current gain av voltage gain ap power gain or whatever i already have a wonderful cheap i e 20 schematic for a 20w amp but i would like to cross improve the circuit the problem be that the part list have ic1 and ic2 a nec70001ab amplifier they look like 11 pin sip package with a heatsink this schematic be publish in a 1991 mag so it may be non existant now anyway i try look up a replacement in the late digi key cat and found it not list 8 the close i could figure be a 9 pin sip a tda1520bu anyone get any idea i thought hey i can rin a pspice simulation use 741 opamp model yea great it work but i guess the 741 make for high power amp a a result i get a voltage gain of  15mv v bad than i start with 8     do anyone have a pspice ckt file with cheap yet good gain how about some model for some of the chip list in this e mail any ascii chip info you guy can send me open to suggestions ideas comments help please e mail since i have little time to search the news     and i  ll post if there  s and interest john
 let you live but just this once     there  s more to a real    storage    scope than just a long persistence phosphor actually the phosphor be n t usually anything special at all what make a storage tube work be a screen place just  behind  the phosphor which becomes charge a the electron beam intially    writes    the trace with the trace now write to the screen a separate low level    flood    electron gun keep the image lit by excite those area of phosphor which be next to the    write    area on the storage screen there be some problem with this the resolution be limited compare to a non storage tube and the store trace tends to    bloom    with time of course this be pretty much obsolete technology do in by the current digital scope which use raster scan display and keep everything in a frame buffer memory anyways                    ah yes from the same people who brought you that amaze new reading program sweep eastern europe    hooked on consonant

 i be interfacing some simple circuit that run on 9v to my cpu board which run at 5 6v the optoisolator be a 4n35 on the lead side i put the signal i want through a 10k resistor to the base of a 2n2222 on the transistor side i tie my cpu input line to the collector which have a pull up resistor of 47k it function ok but seem very slow i can detect pulse that occur at about 2khz but not much faster the rise fall time of this device something like 5us i should be able to detect my target of 40khz but i get 16khz this be do use wire wrap and the wire go to the cpu and to the test pin be about 8 inch long but not do anything high speed in the art of electronics it mention tie the base of the phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the speed be that what i need to do how do i calculate the resistor value
 note i just try to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself from various people on the net so i could be wrong the data be only ever read once bar mistracks and such of course and eventually get turn into 44 1 khz 16 bit two channel data oversampling take two discrete data point and interpolates n 1 point between them for n time oversampling when i ask people say that the interpolation be not simply linear interpolation but significantly more complicate anyway then the purpose of oversampling be to move the    effective    sample rate up to n time 44 1 khz in order to use high frequency antialiasing filter for the same quality filter high oversampling let you build cheaper filter whereas for the same price filter high oversamplings let you build well filter so assume the quality of all other component in a cd player remain the same oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ well sound due to anti alias filter

 that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circle radio electronics compiles all of the card then each advertiser get a computer printout of the name and address of all of the reader who circle their number some magazine also provide the data on self adhesive label and the really big magazine provide the data on computer disk the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get you will notice that the radio electronics information card commonly call a    bingo card    in the industry include line for a company name and a business phone number my guess would be that the big national advertiser make a distinction between hobbiests and professional a best they can for example if you include motorola a your company and include a business phone and a mail stop tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sale engineer call you about a week later if you leave it blank odds be they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet medium and small company be more likely to send you th e whole catalog and then some company like digikey or jameco have nothing to mail out accept the catalog a couple of other interest point about bingo card free industry magazine like edn and such also log your card to their computer they use the information at least three way they note that you really do read the magazine and be more likely to continue your subscription or push you through repeat mailing to re subscribe they also compile how many people request which data for their marketing demographic this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that    23 of reader request data be interested in capacitor    and finally some magazine rent list of reader who request certain information for example tektronics can rent a list of everyone who request information about test equipment other than tektronic  s in the past 6 month the other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazine include how many item you circle on the card if they want the advertiser can attempt to cull out the    literature collector    from the serious potential customer    can you say qualify sale lead i thought you could    what  s the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo card never circle more than 8 number on the card if you want more than 8 item use the second card and mail it a couple of week later if you be really really serious and you really really want the information call the advertiser and ask this will also cut about 15 day off the the response time virtually everyone take a voice on the phone more seriously than data on a computer printout to help insure you keep get a trade magazine that not really    qualify    for send in a bingo card at least every other month and circle two or three number include a business name and phone number even if your house advertiser almost never call

 heh heh heh heh      i laugh because i have the same damn tv and it do the same thing actually it be a goldstar but essentially the same tv and electronics    just a different face plate and name 1  fortunately tv tube explode think the tv mfrs want to make this possibility remote a possible if at all  implode  and the glass that blow out would be the result of the glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion in any case kick it around 2 i fix the tv after get a hold of some schematic it turn out to be a blown 2w resistor feed the flyback transformer i guess the original resistor be a bit too small to dissipate the heat it create burning itself out i checked to make sure the flyback short or anything first oh luckily i have a resistor handy lie around that have just the right value for what i need i see it be more than 50 cent
 first it will not pas a national electrical code inspection secondly the neutral wire be current carry and the ground wire be or only during a fault condition the reason the neutral and ground be tie together in the panel be the tranformer on the power pole have a ground center tap secondary with the ground center tap the neutral this give 120v to neutral ground from each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer so in effect the neutral and ground should be at the same potential                                                                                                    mark e  kilpela email mkilpela mtu edu michigan technological university school of technology

 i be have a look through a couple of component catalogue when i come across a range of peltier effect heat pump intend for cool component for those who have not heard of this effect you put a current through one of these device and it pump heat from one side to the other reverse the current and you reverse the effect i think a temperature difference can give you an emf a well anyway it struck me that you could make a nice cool hot box for picnic with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a couple of heat sink the big device can shift 60w with an efficiency of 80 90 which ai n t bad although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour unfortunately the catalogue list anything more than the basic spec a a heat pump i imagine that you would get a back emf a the temperature gradient across the device increase if so presumably it power decrease a the back emf increase until eventually we have a steady state with no current be consume assume no leakage if so then the final temperature difference between the two side could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it what i would like to know be 1 be the above guess correct 2 what be the open circuit thermal resistance of a typical device i just want to be sure that my coolbox be not go to get warm too fast when i unplug it 3 how do a peltier effect heat pump actually work it look like magic 4 why they use these thing in domestic fridges freezers thanks in advance paul

 yes i know it sound crazy call it an urge call it what you want just ask why anyway like to build a uv flashlight cheaply    flashlight    mean it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if necessary my main question be the bulb where can i get uv bulb do they need a lot of power etc  etc not too concerned with whether long wave or short wave but hey if anyone have a cheap source of bulb i  ll take both check out a medical supply catalog the thing you be look for be call a wood lamp so you can check for wood sign certain skin condition flourecse sp under uv light they come in disposable penlight like type and large ac power type it be also use in eye examination a flourescent dye be introduce to the surface of the eye then uv be shin on it show up scratch and abrasion very clearly that would otherwise be very difficult to detect for the completest the dye be call flouescien and in normal light appear orangish and leaf a mild burning sensation to the eye for 10 15 minute until the tear flush it all out have fun
 check out xicor  s new goodie in the april 12th edition of eetimes x88c64 an 8k 8 e2prom with built in latch and bootloader setup you hook it directly to your  51 power it up the prom initialises the serial port on the  51 you load in your code via rxd this get blat onto the e2prom then you reset and run sure dallas also do something like this too i suppose it would boil down to relative price and the dallas part free up p0 p2 completely i wonder if anyone have ever manage to design a single side pcb with an 8051 573 eprom sram and no link cheer mike
