 from article 1993apr5 200048 23421 ucsu colorado edu by lorenzo rintintin colorado edu eric lorenzo    let me put it like this the only similarity between the three model be the    300    or 3 liter engine displacement actually the sc300 the coupe and the gs300 the funky looking new sedan share the same 3 0 liter inline six and the es300 popular small sedan us 3 0 v6 share with the camry the sc300 be a luxury sports coupe the gs300 be the new luxury sedan and the es300 be the base executive sedan all three look completely different    aamir qazi
 perhaps it be because witness who have left the compound have all testify that the batf shot first they they do not identify themselves before toss in concussion grenade not that anyone inside could have _heard_ such identification after be near a concussion grenade and the announcement from the batf that they have seal the warrant under which they be operating which be a _search_ warrant by the way _not_ an arrest warrant in short perhaps because the batf be wildly out of control and perhaps calmer head have realize that bombing a compound full of woman and child will not improve their position there be a real chance that koresh will be able to prove self defense in court that will leave what four officer dead and no one to blame but the batf followup direct to alt activism where the discussion have rag nearly a long a the seige and which show every sign of not give up nearly a soon larry smith smith ctron com no i speak for cabletron need you ask
 if you already know it you should call the bank credit union  finance company that hold the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost if you be trading in your current car on the new car subtract the payoff amount from the trade in the dealer be give you if this turn out to be a negative number you need to reconsider the deal subtract this difference from the price of the new car this be the size of the loan you will need for the new car the dealer will take care of pay off the loan on your old car out of the money you give them when you pick up your new car at least how it work for me 5 year ago in ohio
 well there  is  a difference i happen to have my sae manual handy but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature the sae number be base on a typical  curve that oil use to all have run from say the viscosity of a room temperature 90 weight at 0c down to say that of a room temperature 5 weight at 20c for a typical 40 weight oil oil that be design for operation in normal temperature just have a weight specification oil that be design for operation in exceedingly cold temperature have a w tacked on the end so in winter in a cold place stick 10w in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year modern multi viscosity oil change viscosity much less with temperature a a result their viscosity graph cross over several curve a multi vis specification peg the curve at two temperature a normal operating temperature and a cold one though i remember the number     in any event the weight do indicate a significant difference remember that your engine be temperature regulated by the thermostat and radiator or air fin most of the time    unless you overheat it or something any weight of oil be well than no oil or than very old carbonize oil thin oil in general lubricate a well at temperature thicker oil will like a 20w50 will lubricate well at temperature but not a well during startup when most engine wear occurs if planning on make long drive the 20w50 be probably fine esp in the summer in your 10w40 car but if make short drive stick to the 10w40
 be clear coat really worth it yes on the showroom floor the car have this deep lustrous shine that just be found on paint job that clear coat on the other hand it seem that every clear coat car that see on the road in a parking lot etc have fine scratch throughout the paint job a do ala my 1992 laser several week ago i have my car professionally polished and waxed when i picked it up it have that same showroom shine that i remember from a year ago when i bought it several day ago i take my car to the dealership for some work a an add bonus they wash my car unfortunately whoever wash it either get the roof which be black the rest of the car be red completely clean before he dry it or he use a dirty towel now my showroom shine be a haze of fine scratch that really visible until the light hit the roof at a particular angle i be to put it mildy somewhat peeve about this do i have any chance of get the dealership to do something about this my guess be  no be there any product on the market that provide a solution to this problem or be i face with the prospect of have the car professionally polished again to hide the scratch information commiseration and sympathy all greatly appreciate
 i understand the fascination with vent window they create a tremendous turbulence and noise that make even a simple connversation impossible at speed above 40mph the current flow throuh ventilation if design right be far more superior

 mk48t02 from thomsom it have a timekeeper clock and 512 byte of nvram which have a lithium battery backup the battery have a life of  10 year of poweroff operation instal in a car it could be left power on continuously and not draw much current the battery would only be use when your auto battery be dead or have be remove in california they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which state that the odometer mileage be correct if incorrect you be require to fill in what you know or guesstimate to be the correct mileage if you lie on this form and be caught you can be prosecute and the buyer can sue you for the value of the mileage differential
 a a stong self defense advocate  statement do littel but irk me of course shoot someone because they throw a rock at your car be out of the question but what if they disabled your car with their rock and then want to come kill rape rob beat  or otherwise harm you your wife kid i think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation you or be it that you value the life of such rock thrower more than your own or those of your family think it happen to you from the sound of it here it have happen to a few people please do not misunderstand the only justification for use deadly force on someone be that if you it will mean your own death or grave bodily harm i be far far away from support vilante justice or anything like that   oh and if you mean to be funny please add the appropriate followup to talk politics guns please     get a bit off track here
 because greyhound have apparently gotten around to instal their radar collision prevention system they use radar to monitor how close other vehicle be and how fast their relative speed be and signal a warn to the driver if come up on something too fast or be get too close this be all i remember from the news report a few month back at the time they be only talk about the possibility of instal the system they mention how it work in bumper to bumper traffic or how it discriminate between a camaro approach at 120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median be approach at 60mph on a curve i do recall something about progressive stage of warning from flash light to audible warning    ie it go from a red    too close    light to hysterically scream    we  re all go to die    james
 hello i have a 92 toyota 4x4 and in the last few week i have be get quite a few    ding    in the paint on the hood from rock and debris off of the road i have never have any major problem with other car trucks in the past maybe a ding once in a while i go to the dealer and he say that it happens all of the time and he recomended put a bug deflector on the hood he say that the truck for some unknown reason seem to have this problem more than some cars  it seem to me that either my luck be really bad or there might be a problem with the paint paint on a monday morning perhaps how well do these bug deflector work for small road debris on truck if anyone have any experiences suggestions please let me know thanks    greg
 sound a lot more like an opel gt to me guess that this be on the same chassis a the kadett rather than the big manta but i could easily be wrong i think the later kadett  s be sell here a buick opel
 my whole point be not to say that the car    go that fast but that they    go that fast a family sedan design to be operable at 85mph suddenly become operable at 130mph because you add some plastic aero effect slightly wider tire and a much large engine what the sho be    a slightly modify family sedan with a powerful engine they even bother improve the  brakes the mustang be essentially the same deal a the sho    a big power plant stuck in a mid size sedan with almost no other modification i have real life experience with the mustang    it handle like a brick except when invoke oversteer of course something i personally avoid do on the highway and stop power be inadequate even from 80mph lot of accelleration    but the rest of the car be not up to par i picked the porsche example because they be design with speed in mind it have to be the 911    it could have be the much cheaper 944 or one of several mercedes or audi model all of these car be fairly expensive    but so be the part that make them drivable at high speed this should be elementary there be a few thing to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up my autobahn knowledge be admittedly second hand but i believe the follow to be true 1  driver be much well discipline in europe than they be here 2  the road comprise the autobahn be much well design than they be here and usually include animal fence this make them far more predictable than most u highway 3  not all of europe be the autobahn most place in europe have speed limit that out of line with what we use to have in the u    if my friend lie to me typically not much high than 120km h i strongly suspect you find a lot of rabbit owner do 120mph nearly 200km h on the autobahn but i could be wrong some people have no respect for their own life if you think so you sure pay attention to my posting
 ok here  s what i understand the sl sl1 sl2 sw1 sw2 be meant to compete with the follow car honda civic toyota tercel sl sl1 toyota corolla sl1 sl2 nissan sentra mazda 323 protoge  subaru loyale impreza isuzu stylus geo prizm ford escort mercury tracer mistubishi mirage plymouth dodge colt their core competition be the civic corolla and sentra most of the other model be in the same class but the first car you would think of i threw in the escort tracer because it have a good amount of japanese technology and have similar reliability stats i include domestic small car such a the cavalier sunbird shadow sundance tempo and topaz since i think saturn be go after car that have at least some degree of japanese root the sc1 sc2 be meant to compete against the follow car toyota paseo honda civic si civic coupes del sol si nissan nx1600 nx2000 mazda mx 3 isuzu impulse geo storm ford escort gt if you look at the price of these car more expensive than 4 door counterpart the be good reason for this it be a more upscale and trend driven market even though many of these model be base on sedan platform their interior etc be good enough to warrant slightly high price here be some of the platform derivation i can think of tercel paseo sentra nx1600 nx2000 civic del sol 323 mx 3 not sure on this one stylus impulse storm to illustrate a tercel start at around 8000 while the paseo start at around 11 000 even a 4 door tercel will cost less than a 2 door paseo now you might be say that the tercel offer the power that some 4 doors offer what i mean be that there be no 4 dr tercel with a comparable powerplant a it sport coupe derivative let  s take another example the isuzu stylus x and impulse xs storm gsi both have the same powerplants a 1 6l 140hp engine but the small 2 dr coupe be generally more expensive again this be because the two door sport coupe market be a more fashion oriented and trend setting segment people be willing to pay more money for this type of car in short even though the sc1 sc2 may be small hence    less    car market orientation dictate a slightly high price than it mechanically equivalent sedan sl1 sl2 version i hope this clear thing up a bit
 sure sound like they get a ringer the 325is i drove be definitely faster than that if you want to quote number my aw autofile show 0 60 in 7 4 1 4 mile in 15 9  it quote car and driver  s figure of 6 9 and 15 3  oh btw these number be for the 325i i know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affect it but take my word for it go drive it

 on the car mention 3 series from the late 80  s the    electronic    odometer be really a mechanical drum type odometer that be driven by pulse from a speed sensor on the rear axle these pulse be convert into mechanical pulse that turn the odometer and speedometer no way change or erase an eprom be go to change the mileage reading it also mean the odometer be just a easy or hard to change a any other mechanical odometer on the other hand it be a bit easy to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading     a simple switch will do the job it also will disable the speed limiter which will enable the car to reach full speed
 oh well     i have to admit that the most disgust feature of volvo  s be their marketing it look like volvo us something like    do you dare to risk your family in any car    attitude which be quite annoy in the long run but now volvo have produce a new good car the volvo 850  front drive 2 4 l 20 valve motor completely new chassis etc even the british magazine    car    like it and believe me that be quite much for a volvo and the american magazine    road track    say that    this be not your uncle olof  s car    and in a positive sense but in any case still like to own the 960 estate strong tank like chassis 3 0l inline six rear drive btw the only car driver who have block me be land rover or jaguar driver
 base on my experience with a  79 fj40 the hard top jeep style model i would definitely give a new model consideration if i be in the market the old model be very well built unless toyota lose it mind i would assume until proven otherwise that the newer model have inherit some if not all of the quality of their ancestor two major difference in the run gear that aware of need study my  79 have a solid front axle housing whereas the newer model have independant front suspension the solid axle be theoretically strong and more reliable than the newer model but only experience will tell the independant front suspension be no doubt a compromise make to satisfy the typical user who will never need a real utility vehicle the second difference be the type of transfer case use on the newer model not sure but i think tioyota go to a full time 4wd or all wheel drive system the old landcruisers have a    lock up    type both have their advantage and disadvantage

 i have just take delivery on a new gm car firebird with a clearcoat finish i assume that it be probably urethane since the industry have move in that direction in paint in year past it use to be recommend that owner wait up to 60 day before you wax a car for the paint to    cure    the dealer shop manager say this also but not sure that he just base it on past tradition do anyone know if this be still a recommend practice or be it well to go ahead and wax right away non abrasive new car wax with the newer finish
 i really must object to that last statement have a lot of experience with a  92 grand be coupe i can firmly state that they do have a lot of outstanding quality very reliable throughout great layout of control and component very roomy consider the exterior size of the car they look sharp inside and out the v6 that i drive have exceptional power and drivability compare to other similar car that i have driven all in all a fun to drive dependable and reasonably price vehicle please knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with specific reason why you feel that way rob bell plains nodak edu
      rear also vent then you  ve do it try answer the damn question i be well aware of the fact that there be no mention of the sc in there well my point be that the sc and the sho both have very similar characteristic front and rear disk ab on the sho high output v6 4 wheel independent suspension very good aerodynamics 3 point harness fat rubber and 130mph  top speed if one of them be up to standard and i think the sc be but the other then why be that no flamage just curiousity james
 if the tire have a leak you should fix it work too well if the engine be hot it more accurate to check the oil when the engine be cool i e not when you be at a gas station

 nothing when a friend of mine go shopping for a small sedan a few year ago she brought me along a a token male so the salesperson give her the    bimbo    treatment her first choice be a mazda 323 and second choice be a nissan sentra we go to a mazda dealership and described what    we    want we start negotiate on the price and the salesdroid kept play the    let me run this price by the sale manager    after play the    good salesman bad salesman    game we finally told him that if he have the authority to negotiate a price perhaps we should be speak directly to someone who do he brought in the sale manager who proceed to dick u around with every trick in the book read remar sutton  s    get take every time    for a list finally after play a few more round of    have to work with u on this price    also know a    each time you come up a thousand dollar come down ten    the salesmanager give a signal to his two sale crony stood up and say    well we come down any more so i guess we help you    and they trouped out of the room leave u sit in the salesman  s office all by ourselves hmm read that sleazy salesman sometimes bug their own office so they can leave and listen in on couple discuss the sale offer and i mention this aloud to my friend while we be sit there wonder why they would leave u in the office instead of show u to the door for lack of anything well to do i picked up the phone on the desk and call another mazda dealership ask for a salesman and begin discuss what kind of price they would consider a few sentence into the conversation mr  salesmanager broke into the line and begin tell me how rude he thought it be that i would call another dealership from    his    phone i say that since announce that our business be over he care and every time i try to talk to the other sale guy the sale manager would drown out our voice with his own how do he know that i be use the phone anyway finally i hung up and we head out of the showroom sale manager and crony come out of a little unmarked room and he begin to berate u again we say that we bother him anymore go next door to the nissan dealership then come the part i wish i could have videotaped a we go out the front door the sale manager shout across the entire showroom customer and all    go ahead you deserve to buy a nissan    so my friend bought a sentra

 archive name rec autos part5 this article be one of a pair of article contain commonly ask automotive question the other article contains question more gear to the automotive enthusiast and so be not crossposted to misc consumers    rpw change a of 14 april 1993 revise brake fluid section a non silicone dot 5 fluid be now apparently available    rpw commonly ask automotive question tire question q what do the funny number on the side of my tire mean a typically you will see something like 195 60hr14 the 195 be the overall width of the tire in millimeter the tread be usually narrower the 60 be the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire have a sidewall height of 0 60 195    117 mm the 14 be the wheel diameter in inch there be also some special tire call trx  tire which have three digit metric wheel diameter designation like 390 which be in millimeter the r mean radial and the h be a speed rating indicate the high speed at which the tire when properly inflate and carry an appropriate load may safely operate common speed rating be s 112mph t 118mph h 130mph and v up to 150mph recent change to the method for specify tire size move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designation like 195 60r14 85h the 85 indicates the per tire load associate with the speed rating    exceed this load in continuous operation at the rat speed be dangerous practice what follow be a table show a number of load index and correspond maximum per tire load load index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 max load kg 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 note that the usual mass vs  weight confusion occurs in this table in some case the letter p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter be give then the application of the tire be passenger car usage a far a i know these letter only appear in the u market the lt designation be prinicipally of interest to owner of light truck and other utility vehicle for the owner of a passenger vehicle there be no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio be omit it be probably 80 but may be 78  tire with an m mud snow designation may have their speed rating reduce by 20 km h about 12mph there be an additional set of rating on tire for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction be grade a b and c with a the best and c the bad treadwear be a numeric rating these value be of limited value a they be assign somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturer and be thus not useful in compare different brand of tire q my car have tire with a funny size designation 185 65hr390 can i put normal tire on the car a your tire be call trx tire they be devise by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they be incompatible with normal tire michelin use a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mount on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tire could not be mount on trx type wheel you will need to aquire different wheel to put a normal tire on your car it be barely possible to fit normal tire on trx wheel and horribly dangerous to do so the tire may simply peel off the rim in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tire be become hard to find in addition to michelin avon make suitable tire goodyear have apparently discontinue their line of trx tire q can i rotate radial from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturer have differ view on this subject many say that swap radial between the left and right hand side of a car be now ok this group include michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranty if such swap be do the best advice be to read your tire manual carefully before rotate your tire and stick to the manufacturer  s recommendation q how many snow tire should i buy and if i buy 2 which end of the car should i put them on a in short 4 and both end to explain many driver in area that get excessive snow or who drive agressively or at all in snow condition get away with only two snow on the drive wheel but there be circumstance where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between be able to start the car go a function of the rear axle or stop and turn the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of put the snow tire on the front only be that if you have to put on the brake while go downhill you run a serious risk of go downhill backwards radar detector and speed limit q why there any comment on radar detector and speed limit in this q a post a because question about detector and speed limit crossposted between misc consumers and rec autos always start long tedious and pointless flame war if you want to talk about either of these topic please subscribe to rec autos or alt flame and keep it there safety equipment q do airbags really work a preliminary statistic suggest the follow airbags work much well than no belt good 3 point belt alone work much well than airbags alone and airbags 3 point belt work slightly well than 3 point belt alone the con to airbags be that some design tend to burn the driver  s hand when vent the byproduct of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some design but not all may knock the driver  s hand from the wheel make retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult brake question q do i always need to get the rotor on my disk brake turn midas always want to do this a no there be specific condition that mandate turn or replace rotor some shop try and make a little extra money by replace rotor more often than be strictly necessary if the rotor be not warp warp and only lightly groove then there be no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotor the rotor on many hondas be a good example be so narrow to begin with that it be not practical to turn them they must be replace when they become too thin warp or badly groove q they tell me i should downshift when brake to slow my car down be this really a good idea a it use to be a very good idea back in the day of mediocre fade prone drum brake in modern disc brake equip car use of downshifting to slow the car be not really necessary except in case of long steep downhill run otherwise modern disc brake be more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstance and they be much cheaper to repair than clutch lining on the other hand many standard driver  s license test in the usa still specify that the driver be test downshift under brake i suggest that before take a u driver  s test you either 1 learn to do this smoothly which take some time and practice or 2 borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluid tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal part of the brake system and also low the boil point of the fluid dot 3 type be old fluid dot 4 and dot 5 be newer specification the principal difference be in wet and dry boil point the dry boil point be important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boil point be important in old brake fluid dot 3 fluid have the low wet and dry boil point _requirements_ dot 4 fluid have well boil point requirement and dot 5 fluid have the best boil point requirement but dot 5 fluid be not clearly superior see the next q a for more detail while the requirement imply that dot 4 fluid be well than dot 3 fluid there may be specific case where a dot 3 fluid be preferable but these be mostly competition application otherwise dot 4 type fluid offer _much_ improve brake pedal feel replacement once a year be recommend for dot 4 fluid although agressive driver may profit by change out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake caliper fairly regularly q what about dot 5 brake fluid a this break down in to two part the dot 5 specification look excellent for performance but the first dot 5 fluid be silicone base silicone fluid be a tricky proposition unlike dot 3 and dot 4 fluid they do not absorb water at all while this may sound like a feature the problem be that any water present pool up in such system interfere with brake performance and corrode any metal at the spot where the pool be occur the water will tend to migrate downwards in the brake system to the brake caliper where most of the corrosion occurs because of this phenomenon it be essential when convert to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replace all rubber part in the brake system when convert to silicone fluid two other issue that come up with silicone fluid 1 they be difficult to pour cleanly that be without air bubble which interferes with get a good brake pedal feel and 2 while they generally have much high boil point than dot 4 fluid they do have high temperature failure mode which be indistinguishable in effect from boil dot 4 fluid silicone fluid may make sense in some street car application but they be certainly not recommend for high performance drive application and the economics be questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluid that meet the dot 5 standard that do not contain silicone these fluid appear to be reasonably compatible with the old dot 3 and dot 4 fluid but i have little information at this time q ab be available on some of the car look at but it cost more be it worth it a this do not have a cut and dry answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pro and con the short answer be that ab cost more both initially and to maintain will generally work well for the average driver that be to say a driver who do not have extensive experience in high performance drive technique and may require the unlearn of some obsolete brake technique like pump brake which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer ab work by monitering the wheel of the car look for sign of lock brake it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheel there be several system on the market it can not detect impend lockup which be what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensor use vary some of the less well design sensor be sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviate from original equipment or oe equivalent component when the sensor detect lockup the ab system responds by unlock the brake either individually or all at once depend on the system if the driver keep their foot firmly plant the ab will end up cycling between the lock and unlocked state if a sensor exist that could detect _impending lockup_ then we could sit right at that point which be where maximum brake effect be achieve this pulse can often be felt in the brake pedal a the system cycle the percentage of the time that the brake be truly engage be call the duty cycle typically in an ab system this be about 40 on dry pavement a train driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably use a technique call threshold brake on wet pavement brake be so chancy that ab will outperform threshold brake nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum brake effect can be acheived with the brake lock only audi of the manufacturer produce abs equipped car have see fit to provide a disable switch for the ab system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of ab be that it preserve steer control this be the case simply because if you be brake near the limit and turn the wheel the ab will release the brake if it see steering triggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brake be apply brake distance will lengthen accordingly an important caution ab can not exceed the maximum theoretical brake force in any give situation if you start slide on glare ice expect an ab system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction be not change by the presence of an ab system in your car a far a maintenence go in addition to the potential restriction list above you have to worry about the follow 1 part cost be much high the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan list for 185 but the oe master cylinder for the abs equipped version of the same car list for over 1000 most manufacturer explicitly forbid use of dot 5 silicone brake fluid in abs equipped vehicle because of the potential cost of replacement of corrode brake system component regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important q what about this threshold brake business a normally not put this in the consumer q a but recent publicity about a number of accident involve police driver in abs equipped chevy caprice suggests that this section be need here    rpw threshold brake be a technique practice by all serious high performance driver if make a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock  em up panic habit entirely and be much to be prefer basically the premise be that tire generate maximum brake force when they have just start to slide but just before the wheel lock up entirely driver who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feel like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many car you can feel that you be near the threshold when the pedal start to firm up a you depress it in any case if you hear the tire whine just a bit not very near the threshold in a car with ab often there be a twinge in the pedal just before the system start cycling if the driver back off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge be felt then they be very close to the threshold and probably achieve well stop distance than if they just punch it and let the ab take over recently there have be a rash of publicity over a number of accident and one death involve police car equip with ab system the police department in question quickly blame the new ab system but accord to autoweek magazine it now seem clear that the problem be a lack of training none of the involve officer have any recent performance drive training there be reason to believe that the driver react to the pulse brake pedal by pump brake an old and discredit technique of stab and release the brake pedal the goal be to try and get brake back with a fail hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute realize that pump brake must cut the effective operation of a work brake system by at least 1 2 so if you cut the 40 duty cycle of an ab system by that much you be give up most of your brake for the wrong reason threshold brake have the advantage in that it be an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car have ab if you do fear a fail hydraulic system then one or two stab at the pedal will be sufficient gas question q do high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some car have knock sensor and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline be use on most car however you should use the cheapest gas that make your car run well check your owner  s manual for detail on what your car need q my car be make for lead gasoline will unleaded gas hurt it a it be possible that unleaded gas may  slightly  increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however a modern lead gasoline actually contain very little lead you should however check your owner  s manual many car from the early 1970s do not actually require lead gasoline q do fuel treatment help what kind should i use a some do and some during the winter it be a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection system never use an additive contain methanol sometimes call methyl alcohol such additive may damage fuel system in car with carbs and almost certainly will damage car with fuel injection manufacturer  s opinion vary on additive contain ethanol sometimes call ethyl alcohol if your car have fuel injection check the owner s manual on your car before use these most manufacturer consider 10 ethanol acceptable in gasoline additive with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillate be fine in fuel inject car an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner be helpful in car with fuel injector although many premium gasoline contain detergent that do the same job some off brand of fuel injector cleaner contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredient before put anything in your gas tank there be a small number of particularly good additive these be noticeably more expensive that the run of the mill one but work much much well among these be chevron techron redline sl 1 wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg 44k a bottle of one of these once every six month be highly recommend q what about detergent gasoline a the quality of detergent package in gasoline varies somewhat bmw have institute a test program and gasoline brand which pas this test may advertise that fact sticker indicate passage of the test be now begin to appear on fuel pump at gas station if such gasoline be use then fuel injector cleaner be probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approve gasoline will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposit lubrication question q what do the number and letter in a motor oil designation mean a there be several different item encode there be a two letter code indicate the type of detergent package that the manufacturer us in the oil this look like se sf cd or such the s code be for gasoline engine application the c code be for diesel engine application the second letter be assign in sequence a new level of protection be developed thus sf be consider well than se se be consider well than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation be the oil weight this be either a single number e g  30 weight or a pair of number separate by the letter w e g  10w30 the latter type be much more commonly use these day and be the only type that most automobile manufacturer specify in operator manual the first number in the designation 10w be the apparent viscosity of the oil when it be cold the w stand for winter the second number 30 be the viscosity of the oil when hot there be a trick here the oil actually get thicker turn from 10 weight to 30 weight a it get hotter what be actually happen be that when the oil be cold it have the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil a it get hotter it get thin a fast a a 10w oil would by the time it be up to temperature it have the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil note that these number actually specify range of viscosity not all 10w oil have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all 30 weight oil have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multi grade oil be cause by additive and it have be report that with the sole exception of castrol gtx 10w40 oil do not retain their multi grade characteristic well over time 10w30 15w40 and 20w50 oil work very well though q be quick lube place any good a some do adequate work but there be quite a few incompetent one out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all time q be oil additive like slick 50 or tufoil any good a slick 50 and tufoil be ptfe based additive many of these have come onto the market recently they be different from the moly based additive that have be around since the early 50  s ptfe be the chemical name for teflon tm a trademark own by dupont in general auto manufacturer do not recommend use of these product most usenet response to question on these additive be favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother rev but long term result whether ptfe additive be effective after 5k mile be debatable some manufacturer such a saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application cause deterioration of the oil seal and eventual leakage some bmw owner have report death of valve seal shortly after the addition of slick 50 to their car this writer have be caution by a slick 50 dealer that slick 50 should _not_ be use in japanese motor a it may clog the oil return passage in the engine otherwise there be no know report of damage cause by ptfe additive on the other hand there be satified slick 50 customer in the world q do synthetic oil really work a yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetic but disagree with the extremely long oil change interval claimed by oil manufacturer auto manufacturer recommend that you continue to change oil at the interval recommend in the owner manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer interval at least change the oil filter at regular interval a synthetic get just a dirty a conventional oil synthetic gear lubricant for manual transmission be another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip be very highly regard and very effective mobil 1 synthetic gear lube get mixed review however q manufacturer be specify longer and longer oil change interval how often should i change my oil a it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always get warm up and you drive it very hard and keep the rev down the manufacturer  s recommendation be probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high rev or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at 3000 mile interval give that most manufacturer be now specify 7500 mile interval if you drive your car much at all say 7500 mile a year then you probably want to change oil every six month anyway if you be store a car during the winter then change oil before store it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc question q my car have a timing belt i hear that bad thing happen when they break what  s the story a it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escort for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt break but the newer car will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motor will not be damage but others will be if no replacement interval be specify for your car then change the belt at least every 60 000 mile some car may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there be any related repair that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escort that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which have be know to seize destroy the timing belt and which then cause major valve damage a a side effect replace the timing belt while ignore the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt break a for performance reason compromise piston design so that the valve and piston will not collide require that the compression ratio of the engine be reduce significantly this be why you be more likely to avoid valve damage in economy car than in performance orient vehicle q what cause unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration conclude that unintended acceleration could not be cause by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report go on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator be probably the cause
 this kind of behavior be what i be shock by in my  experience for cry out loud how do these turkey think they can talk to customer this way and still stay in business again i expect sale people to bow scrape and grovel in my presence but i sure expect to be abuse either i be very surprised by the way the sale people talk to me and in other  negotiating session i overheard in neighbor sale cubicle evidently their success rate be high enough that they continue to do business this way there must be a lot of people out there who be easy to intimidate on the other hand not sure about the  one price no haggle approach that saturn and other be start to use i guess if their fix price be fair ok  maybe the best approach be to do your homework before you go in find out the invoice price of the car add a reasonable profit for the dealer 200  300 offer them that price and stick to it if they get abusive just leave then let them try to screw you after the deal be agree on
 you must be _incredibly_ bore have you consider reading the phone book
 so how do you guy  learn  this be it something you be born with or do you make horrible grind noise the first few time how many time i would think have to have a certain amount of    feel    for it to begin with some people would never get it and others like me would never have the gut to try it unless maybe you be planning to buy a new transmission anyway     btw heard that quite a few trucker and race car driver shift this way

 for those that be interested i get my fully optioned air ab sunroof  92 se r in september 1991 for 13 555 in sacramento ca it be one of the 1st  92s sell few of the dealer have any no local dealer have an ab equip se r  i go straight to the fleet manager at the dealership i like told him what i want make him aware that i knew what his price should be he call me back with exactly what i want from a dealer 125mi away i take delivery the next day
 on wednesday morning another driver decide to illegally turn left in front of me do great damage to my car honda civic i have yet to pay off the car and the body shop say the insurance company want to total the car i be able to get in touch with the person handle my claim so i checked on some thing 1 my payout be 3700 00 2 blue book retail be 5650 00 3 loan value be 4450 00 4 trade in value be 4000 00 could anyone give me any advice on what i should could do if the insurance company do not give me a reasonable amount for the loss of the car thanks james baker
 not to mention my friend  s  54 citroen traction avant with the light switch and dimmer integrate in a single stalk off the steer column those dumb french be apparently copying the japanese before the german
 it depends on your priority a lot of people put high priority on gas mileage and cost than on safety buying    unsafe    econoboxes instead of volvos i personally take a middle ground    the only thing i really look for be a three point seatbelt and 5 mph bumper i figure that 30mph collision into brick wall common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there be lot of low speed collision that do worry me
 if you hold off there be a number of interest convertible come to market in the next few year the new lebaron will be base on the mitsubishi galant which should be an improvement over the current model the new pl compact will have a convertible option also a chrysler product kia maker of the ford festiva be planning a large convertible
 hi maybe someone can help me here     i be look to buy this 1990 nissan maximum gxe for cdn 14000 right now the car have 96000 km or about 60000 mile on it a typical mileage for 1990 car seem to be about 70000 km or about 43k mi the seller just inform me that when he brought the car in for certification he be told that the front break pad and the exhaust have to be replace to meet the legal standard he say he will replace the component before sell the car to me be copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on car i know what this could mean     be 96k km about the time typical for replace the above mention item or be this an indication that the car be abuse would other thing break down or have to be replace soon the seller told me that he use the car on the highway a lot but i know how to verify this     see the paint chipped away in tiny dot in the front edge of the hood though although the maximum be an excellent car and the car be very clean and well kept currently out of warranty a similarly price  90 accord with 70k km will have 2 year or 30k km worth of warranty left and i want to worry about pay for any repair bill     but i also need a car for 5 people     when will the new maximum come out by the way i would very much appreciate your input in this please reply by e mail prefer or post in this newsgroup thanks ryan

 that show how much you know about anything the brake on the sho be very different 9 inch or 9 5 i forget disc all around vent in front the normal taurus setup be small disc front drum rear your argument still boil down to    an sho be driven fast because i jim frost say it design to go fast    pffffftttttt damn straight one of those people who make stuff up and try to pawn it off a god  s own truth if i want lie i can go listen to television
 not a flame just a point be scar at 130 here not because i feel driver who be stupid like the one who be do 130 also and so they pull in right behind you at maybe 1 2 car length      oh yeah real smart     this scare me in city at 50  when i see enough of the car to make it recognizable they be follow too close and when i see them do this and reading a newspaper        sigh      this be why america have 55 65 speed limit our driver be too dumb to realise that reading the paper should be do at breakfast or work not in their car
 howdy a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here the subject after market cruise control the background i recently broke my ankle in a road bicycling accident 4 place five screw yuk in two week i will be return to texas my home from my school byu in provo utah a you can imagine try to drive nearly 1300 mile with a broken right ankle just the epitome of a good time my car do not have a cruise control so i would have to do all the pedal ha ha with my messed up ankle my question what be the general opinion of after market cruise control unit i realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boy go to be a good a a factory or professionally instal unit if there be such a thing and i uderstand that i probably expect much in the way of accuracy look and that sort of thing but anything  s get ta be well than try to drive with a hose ankle i have a 1984 jeep cherokee 4 speed standard 4 4 2 5l engine with kettering sp ignition y know distributor cap rotor that set up    not electronic maybe you could  ve guess it be an  84 but just try to give information a completly a i can i found a cc unit for 80 buck it seem to use the vehicle vacuum system instead of an electric servor motor be this good or bad if i do buy this cc which vacuum hose should i tap it have two speed sensor one magnetic and one that get a signal from the negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pick up or so i understand i can use either one which be best the manual say i read it in the store today that the magnetic axle set up be more accurate but harder to install be there really a big difference it have a sensor for the brake pedal just like other cc but do not have a sensor for the clutch pedal so if i pay real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise be try to get the speed up which would wind the engine up kinda high until i get my wit about me and turn the thing off pretty coordinate so this bother me if it be for my girlfriend car  then  it would bother me but ok with it the installation also call for an attachment to a steady on brake signal and a switched on brake signal i think i can get a switch brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse be i right but not sure where to get the steady on brake signal or for that matter what exactly it be any idea a to what the manufaturer want and where to get it i think i can figure the other thing out like how to hook up the negative side tach type sense gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and all that miscellaneous business but i need a little help with 1  be it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a device 2  be there any particularly good after market cc 3  be    professionally    instal cc signifacantly well and worth the cabbage 4  if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just that it be at pep boy and it 80 be sufficient for my simple need how do i get the thing instal properly specifically the question above my father and i built a    veep    volkswagen power jeep cj 2a when i be in high school so i consider myself fairly good with tool electronics and car so the installation scare me i just want to be certain that i get the thing instal correctly a my cherokee be just a wee bit more complicate than my veep i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody have on the subject if you would like to share some of your wisdom please email a i get over this group very often but i check my mail all the time again thanks for any help anyone may have
 an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy it switch to    sport    mode when the electronics figure it not when the driver set the switch   which be the proper way to do it imo so what do    sport    mode entail several thing 1 rev to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy 2 delayed upshifts i e if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear this be handy if you be charge through corner and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there s another curve approach 3 part throttle downshift base on the  speed  at which the pedal be depressed rather than the  position  of the pedal modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode this be wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red my audi sens this very well and can downshift on a little a half throttle if my right foot be fast enough also i think that a smart automatic can deliver well gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else be equal   remember that the idea of a stick be more economical than an automatic make a big assumption that the driver be smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation   how many time have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruise on the highway at 55 65 in 4th gear of a 5 speed how many of people who drive manual  really  know what the best gear to use be for every conceivable situation sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip control automatic with all possible scenario ratio combination store in rom be likely to do well i can also say that all my previous assumption be prove wrong after i get a car with instantaneous mpg readout     high gear low rev and wide open throttle be more economical than low gear high rev and small throttle opening the explanation be quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight
 be this really the dealer  s cost do you get the dealer  s cost by look at the invoice there may be factory to dealer incentive check this out since i have trouble believe that a dealer would sell a car to me at his cost dealer invoice be not necessarily the dealer cost
 the girl  s ok actually and she recover well enough to go home i know if she have any permanent damage though just in case anybody be concerned     if people start force others to take responsibility for their action thing like this happen untill we stop blame outside cause and start blame the criminal we will continue to let thing like this happen
 in defense of the driver who be in the right lane here in the state people simply do not expect when they be drive to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50 mph i think this be because they be stupid of course there be exception they be just programmed because of the 55mph limit do you in the state when you look in the rear view always calculate future position of car base on a 50  speed differential dont get me wrong i love to drive in the left lane fast but when i overtake car who be on the right i slow down a tad bit if i be to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential i would be the stupid one
 i be in the great storm       my mazda mpv be damage so bad they be go to replace the top door and hood it be black so they will repaint the entire vehicle     estimate cost around 7000 and repair time approx 3 to 4 week

 yeah i use the clutch all the time either do it with ford bmw datsun and chevy and it work fine i think of any reason that it would damage the tranny essentially you be just do what the synchro do anyhow match the engine speed with the tranny speed and slip it into gear sound about right i usually slip it out during throttle down and then blip the throttle and wait until it feel like thing be right usually about a second and then slip it into gear                                                                                                              jon    you obviously know who deal with    gross jong halcyon com

 the chevrolet brother be respect racer test driver for the buick co  when durant be there when the director kick durant out of gm in 1910 he take chevrolet and others with him a mention before they found the successful chevrolet company a little known fact be that the chevrolet co  actually take over gm that be how durant get back in charge of gm    legally his new company chevrolet co  do the buying and gm be a division of chevrolet after 1920 and into the sloan era gm shuffle thing so that the gm board be superior but there be always a degree of autonomy give the chevy division presumably because of the initial structure if you look at the organization chart for gm in sloan  s book chevy division report directly to 14th floor not through the    passenger car division    which cover buick old cadillac and oakland pontiac

 yes this be a common problem the leak occur through the seal of the taillight unfortunately ford have this with most probe and do not have a recall for it very dissatisfy to say the least there be no drain hole that i know of i use a margine tub to drain it regretably i wait three month a i be short cash and they fix it under warrantee then i paid dearly a it mess up my electrical system include a balance motion sensor which be locate near the fuel shutoff in the trunk this result in my passive restraint malfunction    they would not retract so i end up pay about 200 to have the sensor replace 90 to have the tail light reseal they firts replace the hatch gasket which i insist be not the problem so they do not charge me for that when i prove to be right not to mention the water damage to the cover to the trunk spare com partment and algae in the taillight very annoy let the water problem go    get it fix or pay more later consider how common a problem it be i hope every one complains to ford
 i think this be get a little overheat highway robber have be a part of life since the middle age at least human nature to look at history through rise color glass but random act of violence have be a ceaseless part of our heritage overall life be well now than it ever be then just that random individual act of violence have never be historically significant and record keep in the past be never good enough to retain them all
 i prefer a manual to an automatic a it should be i believe that automatic should only be manufacture for people with physical disability who otherwise would not be able to drive automatic transmission allow driver to be lazy more time be available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrate on the road the manual transmission keep the drive always do something grant it a large movement plus drive should be fun drive a manual be fun drive an automatic be a chore in the case of shift speed automatic can be make to shift far faster that any human could move a stick if i be race want and automatic for normal drive go with the manual

 my wife and i look at and drove one last fall this be a 1992 model it be wayyyyyyyyy underpowered i could not imagine drive it in the mountain here in colorado at anything approach highway speed i have read that the new 1993 model have a newer improve hp engine quite serious that i laugh in the salesman face when he say    once broken in it will feel more powerful    i have be use to drive a jeep 4 0l 190hp engine i believe the 92  s land cruiser land yacht be 3 0l the same a the 4runner which be also underpowered in my own personal opinion they be big car very roomy but nothing spectacular

 the part about spending 5000 7000 on repair reminds me of an article i read in a magazine compare the 5 year ownership cost of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that the result which they announce with great flourish be that it cost the same at the end of the period that be their argument to prove that you go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry now if i remember correctly the camry cost about 4000 or so more in initial cost essentially it mean that you spend about 4000 extra on repair on the taurus that be ridiculous every time your car need repair it be extra hassle loss of time and a dozen other thing i would much rather spend 5000 more in initial cost than spend 4000 more in repair cost

 in rec autos you write this mclaren auto transmission i still think only half auto but you may be right have nothing to do with your gm chrysler volvo or whatever auto transmission a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all but there be servo motor which do the shift that mean there be no power loss in the drivetrain if you take out minimal mechanical friction and the sami auto transmission ferrari williams mclaren     tell you when to shift either however these transmission share an important disadvantage with your stock auto trannie they be expensive a long a these servo shifted gearbox available on  normal car gon na stick with my manual i just see an advantage to make up for two grand i lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power except maybe in real heavy traffic but then i drive mostly on the autobahn and country road anyway there  s no point in make a religion out of this i just want to point out a few technical fact and my own opinion so there s no need for a flame war have a safe ride

 great that all these other car can out handle out corner and out  accelerate an integra but get to ask yourself one question do all these other car have a moonroof with a slide sunshade no wimpy pop up sunroof or power slide roof that be opaque a moonroof that can be open to the air close to let just light in or shade so that nothing come in just get to know what  s important
 why you look again at motor trend  s slalom time they be 67 9 right along with the integra and the car do that with small 14 inch tire that be all  weather xgtv4 not to mention that the integra ride alot well than a beretta your acceleartion time also vary magazine to magazine road track and car driver have the gs r at 6 8 to 8 0 for road and track also quarter mile time vary from 15 4 to 16 1 you tell exactly by the number furthermore the integra will definately outrun the beretta on the high end car driver and road track have the gs r do 136 to 141 mph and it get there fast    you always believe those exact number why you drive a gs r and see for your self while the gs r have a low 117 torqye it high gear over a 8000 rpm make up for the difference still call it a torque moster though quad 4 reliable yeah what  s your definition of reliable  if reliable then it safe to say that integra engine in general be near perfect not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter balance shafts the acura have the engine win the reliablity contest hand down you can rev that car all day everyday and never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else i speak from expierence not say the quad 4 be a bad engine but highlight reliability when you compare it to a acura engine and while the integra cost alot more it be a well investment since it will hold it value considerably much well and do a nice job at be a sporty car and practical at the same time

 stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed delete the mustang be a much bad case of design irresponsibility than the sho it hard to predicatbaly drift a stock mustang because of the suspension yes when i think mustang i think school bus f16 motor in my mind the mustang should be fit with a speed limiter at 80 90 or so it just safe check out your local junkyard mustang outnumber other car by a proportion way in excess of sale in junkyard i find it astonish the cu or somesuchlike have not jumped on the mustang for poor brake in relation to power ford should at least standardize on the svo rear brake for all 5 0  s true of northern europe latin country be something else kindof true remember they be build by adolf in the  30  s yes    autobahn    be the german word for freeway other country have different name for loose equivalent autostrada autoroute motorway etc europe do seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit it pass a far a i know typical speed in western europe be much high than the u law enforcement be negligible in my experience comapred to the u a there be no revenue enhancement motivation the thing you really notice be the high speed differential and the more professional attitude to drive you just never see two car run parallel at 55 1 mph oblivious to all around them wrong gti  s go this fast just kind of noisy not the ideal autobahn car a lot of time you see car be driven with the driver foot on the floor how do i know when not make any ground on the identical car in front of you if something happens at 130 150 dead but the same go for much over 35  drive at high speed force you to concentrate i feel much safer drive 130  on the autobahn than 60 80 in typical u traffic because most people seem to be awake never see any driver reading a book on an autobahn i see it all too often in the u craig it just  seem  fast after 30 minute or so of aclimation everybody drive that fast no big deal

 my knowledge about drive in the u s  be also second hand but i think i can correct your statement about our autobahn oh yeah that would be paradise     in fact you can forget it from all heard from my u s  relative driver esp here in germany be much more agg  ressive but not discipline one of my relative a l a  resident hire a car at the nuernberg airport and go about 18 mile to our home he say then that he grow about 1 year old during this ride and swore never drive a car in germany again this be in 1982 and he kept his promise the situation now be even bad a effect of the increase volume of traffic what you mean by well discipline should perhaps be consider cautious due to fear when drive around here you always  have  to take into consideration that the majority of the other driver absolutely relies on you they expect that nobody fails or sleep many of them exploit this by drive a fast a their car can go of course only where that be allow you might think dream on so any mistake you make be a very high risk to your health and if ex  pose to such a situation from your very first day a a driver you learn to handle it or you lose     the way i and most people i know experience our traffic situation whether you think this be pleasant or efficient be up to you i think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speed with modest compare to the volume and decrease rate of lethal accident otoh more and more people esp woman dislike drive because they feel overtaxed and threaten and each accident be one accident too much well design and maintain may be but animal fence be very rare auto  bahnen and many other street have guard rails i hope the right word a plank make from thick steel sheet fix on upright about 2 foot high those guard rails be design for keep vehicle on the road small animal can crawl under the plank big one can easily jump over it the point be that esp large animal be very rare in germany they tend also to be very timid accident cause by animal be a neglegible danger right there be speed linits even on the major part of the autobahn but the attitude towards drive see above seem to be very similar to that in germany be in france switzerland italy austria spain belgium the netherlands besides that you really rely on the resident abide the local speed limit get quite a lot of practise  120k mile and use to travel at 130 mph fyi with a car even small than a rabbit but i consider drive on the highway round paris or milano really a thrill     sorry but find quite a lot rabbit class car or even small mine be a peugeot 205 owner go that fast small car with much hp be very hip over here and most people buying such car afraid to let them run i disagree the size or weight of a car be rather irrelevant formula 1 car weigh less than 700 kg and the driver have a chance to survive accident at 130 mph or high otoh when crash against a solid object at 130 mph it make no difference whether you sit in a porsche a mercedes a tank or on a bicycle your  re dead bye stefan    stefan dalibor dalibor immd3 uni erlangen de

 that be a question that can only be answer by yourself and where you live if you live in a place where crime be apparent then it might be a good idea to get one simply a a deterrent however if a professional thief want your vehicle it a good a go no matter what you do but to slow down any thief it would be a good idea to get the basic option that would be 1 ignition kill or fuel cut off 2 a flash red lead these two be basic to a decent alarm system to slow down the criminal some more get a steer wheel lock that should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easy target but then there  s always car jacking why be life so confuse i hope i help somewhat

 yes but the point be that price be competetive saturn may well be sell a car intend on give the dealer a 2000 profit but since a comperable honda with 500 profit be more expensive it may be well worth it to buy the saturn not necessarily it seem to me that saturn salesdroids who make a commision whereas their counterpart at other dealership generally do make more per hour or whatever this mean that saturn give up the profit to their employee through commision which be take out of per  car profit they just pas it along to less pressure salesmen women maybe maybe not depends on accounting practice rather pay more for dealer service that cut corner to contain cost     2 100 cka  87 carolina blue honda civic dx

 i would suggest you take the car to the near chevron dealer with your own oil and filter ask for an oil change it will cost less than 10 watch him her do it just from watch someone do a job you will be able to learn and remember the sequence and do it right when you do it yourself the next time besides when he she loosens the drain nut the next time around it will be easy for you if it be stuck use an impact wrench not too much force though use a new washer each time you put the nut back

 hi folk i recently bought a 1981 mercury capri my first car ever i have notice a few problem with the car 1  it give very low gas mileage something like 11 mile gallon i hear other car owner speak of gas mileage figure like 25 miles gallon wow etc  2  when i start the car it go into high idle something like 1500 or be it 15000 rpm after drive 4 or 5 mile it come down to 300 or 3000 rpm i would like to know if there be any way by which i can fix these problem or be it natural for an old car like this it have do about 117 000 mile someone suggest that i change rebuild  recondition the carburettor i be not prepared to do it unless i be sure it will fix the problem and yes i get the car tuned up recently within the last 200 mile or so please let me know if you have any suggestion please respond by email since i scan this newsgroup regularly thanks regard    sudhi    sira gopinath sudhindranath email sudhi ucs usl edu
 so it an automatic know if u spec cdn spec for maximas if it be the first set of brake pad on front then this be fine my car eats a set every 15k mile or so the fact that he be replace the muffler too be also ok  the mileage be fairly low but typical fwd stuff be cv joint check the maintenance record with the manufacturer requirement for valve adjustment timing belt change and so on the 60k mile service be often expensive so make sure he have do everything well this be one of the commonly cite method for identify a car with highway mile might check the gas pedal wear too ask him how many set of tire he have be through a highway car might have squeeze by on 2 set a hard driven car 6 10 set well the maximum should be pretty reliable but if it out of warranty you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first stuff for japanese car can be expensive 1995 model year i believe

 archive name rec autos part4 this article be one of a pair of article contain commonly ask automotive question the other article contains question of general consumer interest and be broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc consumers    rpw last change 8 february 1993 ct now permit radar detector usage new tire traction q a    rpw commonly ask question radar question q where be radar detector illegal a in the u currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detector new york prohibits their use in large truck in canada they be illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island they be apparently be illegal through most if not all of europe legislation which would make them illegal be pending in many other jurisdiction chance of such legislation passing varies a great deal q where be radar detector detector use do they really work a usage be spread rapidly initially they be use only in canada but now they be appear in new york and virginia it be unsafe to assume that they be not in use in connecticut and d c  they work by detect a certain frequency radiate by many currently available super het radar detector some brand of detector radiate more strongly than others and be thus more likely to be spot new radar detector be become available which may not be detect by the current generation of detector detector note that a detector may only be spot by one of these device if it be turn on q what be vascar be it some kind of radar a vascar be nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time speed distance computer it depends on the operator press button a the target vehicle pass landmark no radar signal be emit by a vascar system q what be ka band radar where be it use should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band have recently be make available by the fcc for use in the u in so called photo radar installation in these installation a low powered beam be aim across the road at a 45 degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture be take of vehicle which the radar unit determines to have be in violation of the speed limit ticket be mail to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the 45 degree angle many people believe that a radar detector can not give reasonable warn of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturer of radar detector have add such capability anyway the number of locale where photo radar be in use be limited and some question the legality of such unit best advice learn what photo radar unit look like and keep track of where they be use or else speed q do radar jammer work be they legal a quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammer do not work well at all jammer that work be expensive and usually the property of the military jammer be a major violation of the regulation of the federal communication commission of the usa drive technique and vehicle dynamic question q what be understeer and oversteer a understeer and oversteer be term describe the behaviour of a car while corner near the limit limit of adhesion that be most driver do not normally drive hard enough for these term to be descriptive of the situation they encounter simply put they tell whether the car want to go straight in a corner steer less or understeer or it want to turn more in a corner oversteer understeer be commonly design into most production car so that untrained driver inadvertantly travel too fast get into trouble understeer may also be induced by use too much throttle in a corner oversteer be design into some more performance orient car it may be induced by lift on the throttle trail throttle oversteer or tto in extreme case lift on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtail or spin some technical detail in a corner at speed the tire on the car will develop what be call slip angle the slip angle be the angular difference between the direction that the car be travel and the direction that the steer wheel be direct the car to travel in understeer the front wheel have a great slip angle than the rear wheel in oversteer the rear wheel have a great slip angle than the front wheel q what be a rev matched downshift a when downshifting the engine must be rotate faster in the low gear than it be in the high gear however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the rev drop rather than increase in rev matched downshift you blip the throttle before re engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed this result in a much smoother and faster downshift q what do heel and toe mean a heel and toe be a technique use to do a rev matched downshift while brake this be normally challenge because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it be call heel and toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match rev for the downshift in many modern car this be a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle note that some race car driver will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplish the same thing q what be double clutch downshifting a while your right foot be do the above your left foot can do one of three thing nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutch twice be to match the speed of the two shaft in the transmission to the speed of the engine this be usually couple with rev matching so that while the engine be in neutral and the clutch engage the throttle be blipped and both shaft of the transmission speed up the procedure be a follow 0 declutch 1 move gearshift lever to neutral 2 engage clutch 3 match rev 4 declutch 5 move gearshift lever to next low gear 6 engage clutch this sound like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural the problem that double clutching solves be normally the function of the synchronizer within the gearbox in transmission without synchro or with very worn synchro double clutching make it much easy to shift basically if you double clutch well you be not use the synchro at all this be generally unnecessary on street car with synchro in good condition q what do the number for acceleration from 0 60 1 4 mile skidpad and slalom time in the auto magazine really mean may they be compare a in short 1 not a much a the magazine want you to believe and 2 almost never in more detail the acceleration number 0 60mph and 1 4 mile time in the u may be vaguely compare a long a they all come from the same source test procedure vary so much from magazine to magazine that compare a road track number to a car driver number be quite pointless keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver be a major often  the  major part of the equation skidpads vary and even if they skidpad figure be really only test of the stickiness of the stock tire they change radically when tire compound change do not make any assumption about the comparative handle of say two sport sedan base on skidpad number this be not to suggest that skidpads be without value however skidpads be an excellent educational tool at drive school they be simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tire slalom time be slightly more useful they test some small part of the automobile  s transient response however they be also heavily influence by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corner of the car  s envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before make a buying decision for example they tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly go off camber when a car have an adjustable suspension these test be usually do in the sport  set which may be quite unsuitable for daily drive the list of caveat could go on for page after page q my buddy claim that wide tire make any difference accord to his freshman physic textbook and that you ever accelerate or corner at more than 1 0g do he know what talk about a 1 in short he get a clue 2 in more detail the equation for friction use in freshman physic textbook presume that the surface be smooth dry and non deformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which be far below it proper operating temperature pavement be _never_ smooth it be always irregular to a great or lesser extent tire which be not really dry and solid a rubber be a substance which in it natural form be liquid and which have only be coerce into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle be travel over in a tire at operating temperature grip be actually generate by shear stress inside the deform rubber and not by anything even remotely resemble friction in the freshman physic sense of the term the colder a tire be relative to it operating temperature the closer it behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the it proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually    revert    to liquid which be mostly like to happen deep in the tread cause characteristic blister and chunk this latter though be almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street drive so unless a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track drive worry about it because tire traction be completely out of the domain of simple friction it do not obey the freshman physic equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than 1 0g and race car corner and brake at more than 1 0g because simple friction do not apply it be actually possible for different size contact patch to generate differ amount of grip an actual analysis of tire behavior would require technique such a finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism misc question q what do name or acronym stand for a here be a list of some of the name which be commonly ask about be careful in solicit the meaning of other name a misinformation abounds on the net in particular never ask in rec humor if you want a useful result saab svenska aeroplan a  b  or the swedish airplane corporation alfa societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat fabbrica italiana di automobili torino or the italian automobile manufacturer of turin bmw bayerische motoren werke or bavarian motor work mg morris garage q do vw own porsche a no porsche be a publicly held company control by the porsche and piech family porsche have extensive business dealing with vw audi which cause some confusion since currently porsche be in some financial difficulty there be a possibility that mercedes or vw may be interested in purchasing the company in the near future but this be only speculation at this time

 i have a 1986 acura integra 5 speed with 95 000 mile on it it be positively the bad car i have ever own i have an 83 prelude that have 160k mile on it when i sell it and it be still go strong this be with religious attention to maintenance such a oil change etc both car be driven in exactly the same manner   1  it have go through two clutch which be underrated 2 3 set of tire really eats tire in the front even with careful align 3  all strut start leak about 25 30k mile 4  windshield wiper motor burn up service note on this one 5  seek stop work on radio about 20k mile 6  two timing belt 7  constant error signal from computer 8  and finally a rod bearing go out on the no 1 piston seriously damage the crankshaft contaminate the engine etc when the overhaul be do last week it require new crankshaft one new cam shaft have two because the camshaft shatter when they try to mill it the camshaft take 4 week to get because it be on national back order everything on the engine be unique to the 1986 year they go to a new design in 87  part be very expensive

 from article 1993apr16 162950 25849 newsgate sps mot com by markm bigfoot sps mot com mark monninger a couple of month ago i go to a dealership to test drive a car afterwards we sat down to discus price i explain that i want a car just like the one i drove but in a different color he say he could get one exactly like i want from the dealer network within a day we then negotiate a price and sign the deal next day i get a call he explains that they goofed and they have neglect to take into account a price increase the last price increase have occur over 4 month prior to my visit if i still want the car i would have to fork over another 700 a an alternative they would honor the price if i bought the car i test drove which have be sit around for 6 month and have a few mile on it i say goodbye this be a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butt too bad more people demand honesty or these type of dealer would no longer be in business the next dealership i go to be straightforward and honest first thing the salesman say be    let  s see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit i should make    the deal go through with no problem
 no one should ever rely on just a magazine to determine what car they buy i care what magazine btw i subscribe to three other auto rag i just think cu be get a bum rap by these macho men from hell who think real men should read statement like what you say above have no meaning people keep on say    cu be only good for dishwashing detergent    or a you all they say if there be a critical of themsevles a they be of cu maybe there would be some real content john
 while your 0 60 time be consistent with most car magazine and report i saw the pb motorweek show clock a 5 speed sl2 at 7 9 second sure that most sl2 owner will be very lucky to get this speed but 7 9 second be still astonishingly fast for a small 4 door a new civic ex run about 8 2 second 0 60 if not mistaken most car in this class be lucky to be in the 9 second range

 archive name rec autos part1 most recent change 15 march 1993 addition of alt autos karting    rpw     welcome to rec autos     this article be sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggest guideline for discussion the keywords monthly posting  will always appear to make kill this article easy for user of newsreader with kill facility this article be post to all auto group but followup be direct only to rec autos if you understand what this mean ask your system administrator for help or at least for copy of the newuser documentation fail that please subscribe to the newsgroup news announce newusers and read the documentation provide there introduction to the rec autos newsgroup hierarchy rec autos tech be intend for technical discussion of automobile their design construction diagnosis and service other discussion be largely inappropriate especially for sale ad rec autos sport be intend for discussion of legal organize competition involve automobile technical discussion be appropriate insofar a they apply to competition vehicle discussion from either of two viewpoint spectator and participant be encourage argument about sport car be largely inappropriate a be most other discussion for sale ad be inappropriate unless they be for competition vehicle and or equipment discussion of illegal event be marginal one should probably avoid advocate break the law remember the fbi read usenet rec autos driving be intend for discussion related to the drive of automobile also if you must discus 55 vs  65 or radar detector or insert your pet drive peeve bonehead do it here rec autos vw be intend for discussion of issue related to the use and ownership of automobile manufacture by volkswagen this include vws audis seat etc it be create on the ground that the info vw mail list be very successful it should not be presume from the existence of this group that it be appropriate to create many group to cover many different marque group specific to individual marque should only be create on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such a a mail list rec audio car be not properly part of the rec autos hierarchy it be however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so be mention here rec autos antique be intend for the discussion of old car usually more than 25 year old although this be not a hard and fast rule alt hotrod be not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the rec autos reader it be gatewayed to the moderate hotrod mail list and be for serious discussion of modify and develop performance vehicle alt autos rod n custom also not part of the official hierarchy devote to that peculiar american hobby of customize old car alt autos karting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting rec autos be intend to capture discussion on all other automotive topic crossposting crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name be include on the newsgroups line in the article header such article will appear in all of the newsgroups list crossposting be one of the most misunderstood and misuse facility on usenet you should only post to a group because you feel an article be appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience this distinction be subtle but important radar detector article for example be more or less appropriate in rec autos they be almost never appropriate in sci electronics or rec ham radio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci electronics or rec ham radio be not adequate justification for post to either group crossposting between any or all of the rec autos group be usually inappropriate if you find yourself do so consider whether or not it be truly advisable before send your article consider set followup to to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost crossposting between rec autos and misc consumers be chancy at best in particular flame war over the speed limit in the u and or the use of radar detector should never be crossposted between any of these group most reader of sci electronics and rec radio care less about the police radar and radar detector argument that go on endlessly in rec autos it be an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followup to line of article before post a followup in particular be wary of post to misc test rec arts startrek or talk bizarre or any combination of these three the life you save may be your own distribution there be a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article go it be call the distribution field it may be very useful for many reason it should also serve a a reminder that news be a very large and widespread system the distribution of rec autos be fairly extensive a of this write the automotive newsgroups be know to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some location in japan with this in mind i offer the follow hint about use of the distribution field in your article header and on article content 1 please take care not to send for sale ad about clapped out ford maverick in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason like maverick but only 4 door maverick at that 2 when post technical question please include the market for which your car be manufacture for example there be a number of difference between a european market ford escort and a us market escort likewise all 1750cc and early 2000cc alfa romeo reach the u with spica fuel injection european market car usually get carbs often weber these difference can be important to your reader make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame war and a significant spread of misinformation 3 be careful about your capacity and specification when post in the u we get a mix of metric and english system value whereas europe be almost entirely on the metric system a future edition of this monthly post will contain a list of commonly used abbreviation that may not be know in some place that rec autos reach this cut both way so let u not be parochial about it 4 use the distribution field to limit where your article go when possible within north america the value na north america can canada and usa may be use in addition the two letter state abbreviation of the u be support in some case e g if i want to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put    ny nj    in a distribution field note that multiple comma separated value be legal these distribution field vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what be likely to be support in your area the danger of overgeneralization to amplify a warn from the distribution section of this article be wary of make foolish assumption about all car tire etc what be true for a 1973 buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 honda with a 1200cc engine headlight law in sweden be decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information e g  if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answer to your question may be quite useless concern lemon at one time or another every auto manufacturer have manufacture a lemon or two even honda admits to this please waste everyone  s time by announce to the world that your brand x automobile be terrible so all brand x automobile be terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company such article be bad than useless because they cause substantial waste bandwidth while carry little or no useful information concern flame a much a we might wish it a flame free newsgroup be something that most likely will never occur here be some guideline for flame and how to deal with them a list of flame prone topic follow in the next section of this post if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory imagine for a minute that include the word no flame will work it and get exactly what you deserve if go to flame more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well known reference no one be likely to believe bald unsupported assertion be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insult anyone ask the question it be a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i read this group it be a much well idea to end the question with please send email if there be sufficient interest i  ll summarize the result in a later post i may miss post response to this request answer the question if someone want to hop up their yugo tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice if someone want advice on defend a speed ticket tell them to obey the law next time    offensive presumes guilt which be not proven and directly address the original question in general post in order to see your word in print and post in order to enjoy feel smug and self righteous stale and or inflammatory topic certain topic be consider stale by old timer while discussion of them be certainly ok and new factual information be welcome raving about them be extremely tiresome and may get the person who post them ignore altogether some topic be naturally inflammatory it be difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them some of these topic include the follow 1 the 55mph speed limit in the u pro and con 2 discussion about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detector 3 discussion over which radar detector be best 4 discussion over what be a sport car this be one reason why rec autos sport be not a sport car group    everyone would argue about what constitutes a sport car 5 dispute over whether or not u federal law protects the driver s right to own and operate a radar detector 6 buy american discussion 7 clever bumper sticker and personalize license plate 8 insert nationality here car be terrible 9 what kind of car do maxwell smart drive when i have a complete accurate answer it will be add to the commonly asked question article which be also post monthly until then please waste bandwidth on this topic    rpw please direct comment and suggestion about this article to welty cabot balltown cma com

 i agree that a fully loaded sl2 would come close in price to a lower end ford taurus a fully loaded taurus on the other hand would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy sl2 a fully load sl2 would run somewhere around 17 000 while a fully load taurus lx would be somewhere around the 22 000  23 000 range a base taurus gl i believe might start around 15 000 of course there be the taurus sho which can push 30 000 if you really try but this be a totally different car than your mainstream taurus sedan your statement be not entirely faulty just a little inaccurate well ok  at least not bitching about dealer profit like some of the other netters be you seem to have rationally picked out the car that be best for you the loyale be an age design that be about to be replace by the impreza wagon so you probably get a good deal on one of the last one
 true 914 enthusiast will be able to give you a well answer then this but i  ll dump my impression want to own a 914 for about 10 year now come close once but i end up buying a fiero instead big mistake of my life anyway for 4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get take by a nice looker that be a pile of shit the most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment also look for chassis weld together here oh yeah the price range you be talk about must be the 4 banger a 6 if you could find one would be mucho more buck part for the engine be pretty easy to come by for an old car and you can even locate crude in the jc whitney catalog if you have too the machine itself be pretty simple they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake so get it fix by a good bug porsche mechanic would be easy since it be mid engine you may spend more on labor for any mechanical work
 no mustang head but the early one have a simple strut suspension that be with no upper a arm just a strut go down to a low control arm single bushing not an a arm with a tension compression rod locate it in the forward backward direction anyway simple strut suspension like this can be lower just by use shorter spring cut the spring lower the spring perch or shorten the strut below the perch in each of these case the suspension geometry will suffer because the low control arm will not be at the intend angle a spacer place between control arm and the bottom of the strut roughly the height of the reduction will restore the suspension geometry imho the kit that include the spacer be the only way to go        ken

 the big hurdle for automatic imho be not shift speed per se but rather the transmission  s reaction speed when you try to force it to shift manually     i rent an oldsmobile achieva be that a yuppie name or what and a nissan stanza they both have automatic a manual transmission bigot but i have to admit that the transmission on these car be well shifter than i be and yes they respond very quickly to kickdown request the nissan have a tachometer so i be able to figure out which gear i be in the old may have also but i remember i believe it shift all the way down to second at about 50 mph when my foot told it    no i really want to accelerate quickly    i would still prefer a manual but i delude myself into think that i can out accelerate a modern automatic and very smooth at shift but certainly not a good a an automatic

 i think vw get caught out on the airbag thing only be in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant sell feature vw assume that automatic belt would satisfy govt requirement for passive restraint but guess that the  merican consumer would actually make buy decision base on the presence of an airbag vw be really hurt right now in the u market check out the article in last week  s autoweek about the crisis at vw golf and jettas will be come from the plant in mexico but they have the quality at that facility a per normal vw practice the u launch of the jetta iii be delayed again and again until a good chunk of the useful life of the design be spent i think that passats come from germany so there be not the same quality and availability issue a nice car with a nice engine whether vw will be a player in the u market in two year  s time be a different question

 say you bought your saturn at 13k with a dealer profit of 2k if the dealer profit be 1000 then you would only be pay 12k for the same car so that save money moreover if saturn really do reduce the dealer profit margin by 1000 then their car will be even well deal say if the price of a saturn be already 1000 below market average for the class of car then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be 2000 below market average it will 1 attract even more people to buy saturn because it would save them money 2 force the competitor to low their price to survive now not only will saturn owner benefit from a low dealer profit even the buyer for other car will pay less that save money

         some other owner on the ford probe world std com mail list have comment about this problem but i see it happen on my 3 month old  93 probe gt i think this may be something that ford have correct since the initial batch of car also someone say that ford have issue a service bulletin to inform dealer about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it see any of these problem nor have i see these mention on the mail list so these might just be have bad luck with these definitely no problem like these either i be able to find any obvious place where they screw up hmmm i get two key with my car something tell me you get stiffed by your dealer on this actually if you count the    credit card    key that come in the owner  s binder i get 3 key but since the credit card key have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i count it the latter be probably because of the air bag pretty much take up all the space where expect to find the horn speak of the horn i be surprised to find that the probe come with one of those nice  merican sound horn instead of the japanese sound kind the previous probe have japanese horn yeah not very badly but enough to be annoy sometimes i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine the interior be very very nice too very please to the eye and ergonomically sound     yes this car  s stiff suspension for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car strongly suggest look into the mx 6 the problem with the back seat be that there  s no leg room plenty of head room though shorter people fit back there without any complaint so long a the seat they be sit behind be pull forward a bit to give them a place to put their foot the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then always be a sucker for open air drive no leakage problem or anything like that     yet i heard about this one i know that some of the very early probe  89 and maybe  90 have problem with prematurely rust muffler which ford will replace at no charge but i heard about anything like this concern the  93 probe i have any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that be leak but the dealer take care of that promptly and even give me a free rental car for the day and a half that i be without my car i be quite happy with the way they handle     especially consider that i be expect the bad from them from what heard it sound like ford mazda have some qc problem with the probe and probably mx 6 when they first go into production but i think these problem have mostly be correct at this point almost always to be expect with a completely new car like this though hope this help  chuck

 awww right you want all the home mechanic line up against a wall and shot eh bull pucky you chicken read the service manual and get your head out of the sand certainly there be tool for the job that be cheaper than an alignment rack that do the job a competently albeit not a swiftly if not more accurate due to the natural pride an owner mechanic place on his work you can do an acceptable job of align a car use simple tool and some imaginative work that would  never  have the effect of endanger anyones life the bad that happens be that your tire wear oddly well you could have the wheel aim totally pigeon toed and not be able to steer the car raise your hand those that think their vision be so poor that they would screw up this badly i bet you be one of those people that feel that hone a cylinder wall with sand paper will kill million of people it aint magic go take the certification course and look at the people that have never learn to add in their whole life that be take the certification btw i be disgust at the colt and some of the other chrysler offering because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them my  84 chrysler laser similar to the daytona a reskinned colt need a realignment every 3 month     bolt a good grade 12 2x4 to each wheel use a carefully weld spacer jig measure toe in adjust to manufacturer spec camber a bit more difficult to adjust and measure     i use a micrometer to measure the space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be place on upper and low portion of the rim on the inside of wheel hard to explain this same tool could be use instead of the 2x4s i have make these tool up  right  after the last alignment do professionally so i have a reference that the original poster might not
 the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions   i get much strong acceleration if i let the convertor lockup   which i can induce by briefly lift off then quickly but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown apply throttle above 3000 rpm the convertor will never unlock it would kickdown first who say there  s no skill involve in drive an automatic i think of it a the throttle and shifter combine into a single pedal with my car i can pretty much influence it shift pattern with my right foot while have both hand to steer

 yes there be consumer confusion in the early 80  s with the fuel crisis etc  everyone want well fuel mileage diesel fuel be the cheapest fuel available and usually provide well mileage than comparable gasoline engine so gm decide to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine i think be a 5 7 liter big mistake the engine be not redesign but convert the engine could not handle the high compression etc lot of problem with these car this thew up a big red flag to the casual observer    don    t buy a diesel they be bad this be a gross generalization ask yourself this question    if your livelihood depend on drive lot of it would you use a dependable or undependable but cheaper in the short run vehicle what do greyhound bus have in them trailer truck even train locomotive be these gasoline engine no they be diesel tractor trailer truck manufacturer provide a 500 000 mile warrantee with they vehicle i own an 82 diesel suburban the 6 2l diesel be a great engine just keep go it be more expensive when new than the gasoline engine vehicle be the only problem with diesel engine be that when they need to be rebuilt they be expensive in a gas 350 engine you will pay about 1000 for a rebuild diesel 6 2l be about 2000 but then again the diesel engine last about twice a long and get about 50 well mileage a carburator for a gasoline engine cost about 100 to rebuild or less a rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about 500 or more but then again you never need a tune up if look at a rebuilt 6 2l say you get a great deal check to see if the fuel injection pump be rebuilt also
 perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup light be for we agree that they serve the dual purpose of let people behind your car know that you have it in reverse and that they can also light up the area behind your car while backing up so you can see backup lamp on current model be much brighter than they use to be on old car those on my taurus wagon be quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car and much brighter than those on my earlier car from the 60 and 70 insofar a vettes have side backup light look at a  92 or  93 model or perhaps a year or two earlier too and see red side marker lamp and white side marker lamp both near the car  s hindquarter those just white reflector

 while not exactly a service incident i have a similar experience recently when i bought a new truck i have picked out the vehicle i want and after a little haggle we agree on a price i write them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them be back that even to pick up the truck when i return i have to wait about an hour before the finance guy could get to me when i finally get in there everything go smoothly until he start add up the number he then discover that they have miscalculate the tax license by about 150 he then say he need another 150 from me i say we have already agree on a price and it be their problem i give them any more money the finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceed to give me a hard time i remind him that i be the customer and i think i should be treat like that and that if he back off he could forget the whole deal he make some smart remark so i told him where he could stick it snatch back my check and left needle to say they be not pleased by the turn of event early the next morning i get a call from the general sale manager want to know what happen i related the story and he apologise profusely and ask if there be anything they could do to change my mind i told him that if they give me the truck for free i probably still take it that there be other dealer in town i be a repeat customer of theirs and that they should learn how to treat customer etc etc     i be still pretty steam about the whole affair he give me the line about hat to lose a customer and they would try to find a solution etc etc i told him not to bother thanks go somewhere else a couple hour later the owner of the dealership call me all apologetic etc etc etc and say that they would cover the 150 plus knock another 400 off the price of the truck i told him think about it and he give me his private direct phone number his secretary  s name and assure me that they value me a a customer etc etc etc     i thought about it for a few hour and discuss it with my wife and we decide what the hell     that be a pretty decent deal so i call him back and accepted his offer when i go back the next day to pick up the truck i receive the royal treatment everyone seem to know about the incident even the lot boy everything go smoothly and i be out of there in my new truck in about 30 min so i guess a reasonably satisfied customer however it should not have happen in the first place i be a bit shock to have a sale person talk to me like that i expect them to bow and grovel but i sure expect to be give a hard time either esp when their mistake anyway happy with the truck and it turn out to be a couple hundred dollar under invoice and they paid most of the first year  s license fee not sure whether i  ll go back to that dealer tho

toyota celica gt i decide to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runner include the toyota supra turbo and the porsche 924 1987 model year i narrow it down to those two i like the simplicity and handle and snob appeal too of drive a porsche the supra turbo be less money and have more feature and performance almost a personal luxury car it have well acceleration and a high top speed than the 924  i be almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924 but i decide to stop by my insurance agent  s office on the way i ask about what would happen to my rate with either car    if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same a the celica the  85 celica be consider a subcompact and for that year be rat a one of the safest car with a slight increase because the car will be 2 year newer our lower risk division will continue to handle your account    if you buy the porsche 924 have to change you to the standard high rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a 944 another story again cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that       but the supra be much faster than the 924 and the 924 be actually faster than the standard 944  that doens t make sense    what the book say we insure corvette either for some reason the underwriter consider supras and their driver a very traditional and conservative    i eventually go with the supra for a number of reason the porsche dealer have a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payment it would have take a year longer to pay for the porsche plus it high insurance i conclude that the high insurance be related to probability of auto theft                                everyone  s entitle to my opinion              _     _    _

 my friend brought a subaru svx recently i have drove it for couple time and i think it a great car esp on snow however when she take it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill come out to be about 80 dollar the dealer told u it be because to change the oil filter on a svx it be necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that take an hour of labour at first we think we be be ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they be charge roughly the same price so be there any svx owner out there that have the same problem and if the oil change story be true then the engineer of subaru look pretty stubid to me by the way the car look great

 the quality of autobahn be something of a myth the road surface much different to a typical tx freeway they be well in term of light safety sign roadmarkings etc have no problem drive 130 on most u freeway a it be i save it for the backroads which really be more likely to be dangerous it would have to be quite severe i recall any u freeway without road damage warning that i would regard a unsafe at 130 in any decent well damped car note that my definition of decent well damped would exclude most typical american sedan i know where you live but i would be much more worried about cop other traffic etc than the road surface at 130  it just that fast or that dangerous if you have a probe gt no problem the 4cyl model i have driven would be likely to be unpredictable at high speed

  nnnnnnnng  thank you for play i can not agree with this i believe this and to put it nicely it be a piece of junk i love this car i baby it i pamper it and after 2 year it just stay together i would say that not everyone will have the problem that i have but know this not just the car it be the ability to get the car fix which will not happen at any chrysler dodge take your pick dealer i care if there be go to reform their dealers service with the intro of the lh car i will believe it when i see it case and point the local dodge dealer you drive up just look you even get out of your door when about 10 yes 10 salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards service be about 2 time bad than that i have an alignment problem but they try to tell me that the k frame be bent and about 2000 dollar of work parts to fix it let me tell you the problem i have and i take care of this car i put alot of mile on it in the first couple year but take it to every checkup it need and many that have be 1988 dodge shadow e these be replace within the 4 year that i own the car engine 4 alternator rear suspension torsion bar 2 water pump 5 thermostat hall effect sensor main computer 4 battery these be rebuilt repaired radiator automatic transmission power steer those be just the thing i can remember off the top of my head for about a year before i sell the car i say to myself a good car i just find anybody competent enough the fix it in the end before i trade it in for a saturn the power steer start act up again i just stop put money into it i must have put at least 5000  7000 worth of repair over lifetime i be sorry but lee iacocca can bite me bullshit whoever back em best be just afraid the stupid thing be go to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh have be nickname last hope you can do well and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel be a quality product saturn i will not touch another chrysler product again no way i care how good the lh car look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get gm much well thank god they control saturn like they do their division or it would be just another marketing ploy get me wrong i will be watch my car which i do like like a hawk for the next 4 year i be much more hesitant to say it or any car be really good until it have prove itself to me but since someone else point out c d a a source i will note because i use to read these magazine that car and driver have never have a good thing to say about most chrysler product shadow for one always be they moan about the reguritated k car and engine whereas motor trend always thought they be great car no car magazine be really objective and although there be alot of people who like consumer report i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash test time will tell how good a car they be the shadow sundance rate much bad than average in fact none of the chrysler  s rate a well than average i think the best one be just average exclude the diamond star mitsubishi stuff and the lh  s you can find bad stuff about the shadow try a i might when i research the saturn i could not find anything bad about it there be a great deal of information about this company just because it be a new american company and it have create quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason much more than the introduction of any new model line of any establish company i read an article which have a sub column an i think this imprint on me more than anything else some big wig in toyota say and i quote    we be watch them very closely    come on everybody grow up the foreign car especially the japanese have be kick our butt for good reason the american car company could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these day to set in their way which be one of the reason saturn be create they be still struggle because they learn yet they have the ability the worker be not inferior the technology be not out of date but their attitude be and they be just find this out call competition gentleman women if you satisfy the demand of the consumer well your out    asbestos suit on

 the big win with the v 1 be not it range but rather it directionality and multiple transmitter track which you later call a    gimmick       a conclusion i disagree with since the detector incorporates multiple receiver not surprising that significantly more expensive while the add capability may not help you there be add value for those of u who live in area where there be a lot of false alarms i certainly call it    interest    but another person who think that the add value might be come at too high a cost very adequate radar detector be available for less than half the cost and one of them have suit me rather well if i do more long distance travel in area not familiar with probably consider get the v 1 because additional information would be useful in discriminate false alarm

 i couldnt agree more that be how it should work people should also always see motorcycle too i constantly scan behind me i have one of those wink mirror and two outside mirror i actually spend just a much time check my six cop you know i still get caught off guard every now and then
