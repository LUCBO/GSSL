b"your statement be a common misconception but it just true in the german weimar system the chancellor be not necessarily the leader of the large reichstag party the chancellor be appoint by the president and generally be the leader of a coalition of party who could form an effective majority in the reichstag beyond that the implication that hitler rise to the chancellorship because a majority of german want nazi rule be false a well before president hindenburg appoint hitler chancellor in january 1933 the german people do not show a particular desire to be lead either by hitler or by the nazi party these be the result of the march 1932 election for president the closest hitler ever come to direct election hindenburg 49.6 hitler 30.1 thaelmann 13.2 duesterberg 6.8 in the runoff election in april the result be hindenburg 53 hitler 36.8 thaelmann 10.2 so we can see that hitler personally be support by only about a third of german voter similarly the nazi party never receive more than 37 of the vote in reichstag election that occur in july 1932. in the november 1932 election the nazi *lost* two million vote and 34 seat down from 230 to 196 out of the 608 in the reichstag comparitively the socialist have 121 and the communist 100. the communist have gain 11 seat and the german national party which have support the previous government have picked up a million of the nazi lose vote to gain 15 seat up to 52 i think the other large party be the catholic center party i know how many seat they have but i think they be decline and there be numerous other small party thus the nazi vote be on the decline at the time hitler be appoint chancellor what brought hitler to power be *not* the demand of the german people for hitler or the nazi to run thing but the inability of the other party to put their difference behind them in favor of form an effective government for the country germany do not have an endure democratic tradition and their parliamentary system lack effective center party that favor the interest of the majority of the population instead what they have be a number of small party who be unable to put aside their own specific objective in order to combine against the nazi who be out to end the democratic process in fact part of the problem be that some of the other party with substantial representation like the communist be also out to end the democratic process but with different result in mind and generally mind see parliamentary democracy go under germany have already have a non-nazi chancellor with a majority coalition for five month while the nazi have be the large reichstag party and there certainly be no danger of a revolution in favor of the nazi if anything the nazi be start to get desperate because they have fail to get enough support to make hitler president and their popular vote have begin to decline hitler be not hindenburg 's first choice to be chancellor not even his second choice first von papen have be chancellor since june 1932. after the november election when the nazi *lost* seat hindenburg first prevail on von papen to remain a chancellor but there be intrigue behind his back and support for him be lack so then hindenburg turn to von schleicher who become chancellor for two month eventually he too be unable to hold together a work coalition of party to oppose the nazi who refuse to participate in any government that be not lead by a nazi chancellor some of the nazi leadership particularly gregor strasser who be the 2 man in the party at the time want to participate in a coalition government but others know the party 's support be wan figure that their best hope to gain power lay in undermine the democratic process nevertheless the country be govern for seven month by chancellor who be not nazi even though the nazi be the large reichstag party the failure of these men to achieve a work coalition be due to the inability of their coalition party to work together here 's how william shirer put it in _the rise and fall of the third reich_ the cardinal error of the german who oppose nazism be their failure to unite against it at the crest of their popular strength in july 1932 the national socialist have attain but 37 percent of the vote but the 63 percent of the german people who express their opposition to hitler be much too divide and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have know would overwhelm them unless they united however temporarily to stamp it out true the german people support hitler after he become chancellor but that change the fact that there be not overwhelm support for him *before* he be in power the german people be not cry out for hitler to take over no matter how bad economic condition be the leftist party socialists/communists probably have more support in total than the nazi hitler use the fact that others be passively or actively willing to see the government paralyze a a mean to take it over"

limbaugh 's transcribed rant the way thing ought to be before sahl issue his comparative review a usual sahl 's be independent and sharp a a scalpel my effort can only dream of compare favorably to mort 's at least it have a fairly popular orginating premise everyone mention the idea to thought it be either divinely inspire or at least past due for delivery those reaction be base on parallel that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the act of those false prophet both be note for their galvanize oratorical skill which they both use with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportion in fact limbaugh claim to have an audience of just over 12 million almost identical to the number of vote cast for hitler in the april 1932 german election both use a myopic social perspective to build the cult and enthusiastically amputate fact from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt the last point be glaringly document by passage in the opening page of both book hitler 's example be when on page 5 he claim the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter he bombed part of a railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg be caught in the act in 1923 be `` betrayed to france by a representative of his government '' when there have never be any factual foundation for such a statement in fact the government of both the reich and prussia a well a the vatican actively intervene to save him from execution and almost succeed limbaugh follow suit by make the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that `` in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public place ... god be unconstitutional '' of course not god but the official imposition of particular concept of god against an individual 's will unconstitutional but limbaugh be too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that of course one would assume that by compare the two book my main point would be that the way thing ought to be be the modern american mein kampf not really at the time of the first german version of mein kampf hitler be just four month out of prison june 1925 and try to reorganize the nazi he use the book to build his dozen million follower limbaugh on the other hand come up with his book after building his dozen million twelve million go a longer way in weimar germany that it do in the republicrat united state thus the more accurate parallel would be that limbaugh 's daily three-hour radio show be the american mein kampf the primary propoganda tool use to pump up the angry volume and that the way thing ought to be be actually the american triumph of the will a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium also the print word be the more important medium in weimar germany since radio be still be thought of by impoverish german a a medium of luxury in 1925. today on the other hand american be more likely to spend a few second to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop 22 for 304 page of transcript of the same word but a mort sahl also observe on the radio the other night some cloutmeister of the radical right want limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda and remember sahl be an al haig conservative these day mort might not know exactly who rush 's equivalent of rodolf hess be the book itself suggests ed mclaughlin the former president of abc radio and now limbaugh 's partner in efm medium the radio program 's production company but mort himself be a veteran of the talk show have host them in new york washington and los angeles he know what evil lurks in the heart of major market medium men he know that limbaugh could not have collect his audience have not the opportunity be place on a silver platter and hand to him limbaugh earns his money just a honestly a al capone do almost worthy of a rico indictment on question of social issue there be an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seem to echo hitler 's venom for example on their own qualification to control society hitler `` out of the host of sometimes million of people who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly perhaps understand it one man author 's emphasis must step forward in order to form with apodeictic force out of the waver world of imagination of the great mass granite principle and to take up the fight for their sole correctness until out of the play wave of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises '' page 577 limbaugh `` who need the medium when they 've get

b"the difference in the litigation environment be reflect in the fee lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice be really why we spend less use the most expensive approach of pure insurance in canada along with france and germany without hmo 's -- the nyt have admit that malpractice insurance fee be an order of magnitude low in canada but doctor take-home pay be almost equal to american doctor also minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system be so-o-o simple early march part of the deal for use the all-insurance approach like the french and german do hey why they criticize france and germany be it because too many people take french and german in college to make the accusation stick be to preserve the doctor independance since the provincial wing of the cma be the one that go to bat when the fee schedule hike be present the politically-bent doctor be just cackle when they realize the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialize medicine approach like britain 's national health service for non-life threaten thing market argument adequately cover why certain procedure be in scarcer demand i have md friend who make a living a specialist back in manitoba not due to the insurance rate but because they get enough customer -- the cma medical monopoly 's grip on doctor licence a in the u aside -- so they must move to large place however this do not refute debunk of wait line for urgent and routine care a have be do in the u.s. by consumer report health policy study cite by prof. dennis e. shea on usenet cnn nyt etc doug fierro have post a nyt article from 3 week ago about canada's health insurance approach on talk.politics.medicine there be one small error in the article not all of our hospital be private of course the one thing to note be that in the canada/france/germany case private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector they realize they be keep low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for thing like private/semi-private room vs. ward accomodation dental glass etc for corporate or personal benefit have nothing to do with you if you want to be cover for basic care at that point they even consider a `` voucher '' approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policy to make up the difference in the federal guideline and market stuff it be `` free '' in that there be no deductible nor copayments two thing which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it be i know that when work in alberta ontario and quebec i be aware that i be pay for health insurance e.g. in toronto ohip fee be list on my pay stub manitoba do not collect at paycheque time but only annually at income tax time built into the tax rate only fiscal naif will proclaim that free along with the canadian left for that be part of their brainwashing agenda the french do have copayments though france magazine 's summer 1992 edition have a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage include a sample chart of copayment percentage for 1-30 day cover for 80 of the public hospital rate 100 afterward with extra private insurance you can get into a private hospital and be cover for any difference beyond the public hospital rate the public insurance cover 100 beyond 30 day or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference be paid out-of-pocket or accord to your supplementary private insurance over 2/3rds of french have some form of extra private insurance so the other 30 of health cost in europe be out of private fund not glean from other tax the gdp figure be combine public and private expenditure for total outlay use the same method that yield the 13-14 figure for the u.s. health insurance do exist in canada and in western europe it just that it cover basic care you can opt out in canada and germany but have to go uninsured a a result because there be too few other people that do so -- i.e. no market when private insurance realize how much money make without the risk involve in basic insurance e.g. neurosurgery versus deluxe amenity e.g. have to call granada tv to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone 's private hospital room they start to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility in quebec last spring a consortium of private insurer publicly warn against any thought of privatize routine low cost part of that province's public health insurance plan gld"

be you go to do about it q george what do you know about these allege note take by boris yeltsin during one of the meeting in which it appear that the president told boris yeltsin not to trust the japanese that when they say yes they mean no mr. stephanopoulos i think a complete misread of what happen at the meeting the context of the conversation be that president clinton be actually reassure president yeltsin at the time about his conversation with prime minister miyazawa over the kuril island and the prime minister 's belief that japan would play a constructive role in the g-7 process i mean this be a casual comment about japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it be in the context of a conversation where he be reassure president yeltsin that he believe the japanese be serious about their commitment to the g-7 process q be you say that the president say that when the japanese say yes they mean no mr. stephanopoulos not -- i know the exact word and there be a much longer discussion about he do say something along the line that he believe that on this issue prime minister miyazawa intend to really go forward with the g-7 process q have there be any attempt to explain this to the japanese because apparently the japanese press have picked this up and there appear to be -- mr. stephanopoulos see the report in the japanese press and it actually do put the situation in context it do talk about the japanese -- understand the japanese point of view i think go to be a problem i believe that there may have be some diplomatic context just to clear thing up but not positive q george be the specific comment that be make specific to the kuril island situation or be it a general observation on japanese etiquette mr. stephanopoulos the discussion be about -- q the specific comment be what ask about that have allege to have be translate from the russian note `` when the japanese say yes they mean no '' mr. stephanopoulos well it be a combination i mean i think the whole sentence i think that the specific comment be a broad general observation follow up by a specific finish to the sentence where he say in this case he believe that prime minister miyazawa mean to keep the commitment q be he say it facetiously first mr. stephanopoulos i think it be just a casual observation q and then you say diplomatic contact be make to clear it up have the president sent a message mr. stephanopoulos no i think the president spoke i believe that secretary christopher have make some call but not sure exactly how many q well this obviously be a big deal than make it out to be if christopher have have to make some call mr. stephanopoulos no no it be just that we get the report in vancouver and the secretary want to make sure that it be understood and make sure there be absolutely no mr. stephanopoulos -- report in vancouver and the secretary want to make sure that it be understood and make sure there be absolutely no misunderstand and i believe there be on q what be our position about the japanese that they may have to say one thing but actualy mean another mr. stephanopoulos no the position on the japanese be a the president state to president yeltsin throughout the two day he say that he have have a good conversation with prime minister miazawa prior to the summit he reiterate the u.s. position the long-standing support for the japanese position on the kuril island but also reiterate prime minister miazawa 's commitment to move forward on the g-7 process and to play a constructive role and i think president yeltsin be very glad to hear that q after listen to secretary christopher on iraq for the last few day a little confuse what be the u.s. policy do you want to see saddam hussein overturn mr. stephanopoulos the same policy that secretary christopher have reiterate and all of the u.s official have reiterate we expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all u.n. resolution right now we do not have that compliance q throw it out far that if iraq complies saddam stay in office mr. stephanopoulos right i think that -- our judgment be that it be not possible for saddam hussein to comply with the resolution and stay in power but the important point be that we expect compliance by iraq with all u.n. resolution and we will continue to demand it q and be you concerned the iran will become the dominant power in the area -- mr. stephanopoulos secretary christopher have also spoken to iran over the last several day and he say we also expect full iranian compliance with all international norm and stop support of terrorism q a very glib statement that he stay in power if he complies with u.n. resolution on what logic do you base that mr. stephanopoulos right now saddam hussein be not comply with the u.n. resolution at all he be not respect the right of his people a be require by the u.n. resolution he be not fully comply with all the resolution regard inspection he be not fully comply with all the resolution regard armament q well when do you think that if he do comply he would be out of power mr. stephanopoulos well right now his power rest on the repression of his people if he stop do that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power q george back on the stimulus package why be it that you and the president accuse the republican of play pure politics and perpetuate gridlock why be it that -- what evidence do you have that they just have a genuine idealogical difference with you in good faith mr. stephanopoulos well the fact that several time in the past the republican many of the one who be now lead the fight for the filibuster have support the very funding they now seek to stop most especially the highway funding q george in regard to that some of the moderate republican say that the white house err by not be more open to them during the -- while the plan be put together that they have one sort of proforma meeting between the white house and the senate republican and that be it do the administration look back and think perhaps it could have do a well job of work with some mr. stephanopoulos well not sure that true that there be only one meeting i mean the president met with the republican leadership on at least two occasion before the introduction of his package he met with the entire senate republican caucus also for lunch and go up there we be continually in contact with a many republican a we can find who have an interest in the president 's package we be interested in what they have to say a well but we believe that this program be important and go to continue to fight for it q your all or nothing do it with the democrat alone strategy do you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through mr. stephanopoulos well i mean i think that there be no question that under the senate rule a determine minority can frustrate activity i mean there be just no question about that you only need 40 plus one to keep go 40 plus one to keep go and to stop any action and what the republican be do q go to rethink the way you attempt to get other thing pass a you go through this process for the rest of the summer q work with republican and try to woo some republican into your camp mr. stephanopoulos i think go to continue to look for the support of republican whenever we can get it on the president 's intiatives q but on this one -- how be you go to do it differently than you do it on this one because on this one you really do stiff the republican from the begin and make it clear that it be a democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really need republican vote be you go to take a different tack when you have to go for particular vote when you have to go through -- mr. stephanopoulos i see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road clearly the president 's go to continue to reach out when he can q you have any regret then about the way you have handle it up to now and you plan any change in your approach in deal with the republican in congress base on this experience mr. stephanopoulos obviously the president would like his package pass a quickly a possible and go to continue to press for that we will continue to reach out to republican there 's not question about that and continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenue for cooperation in this case the republican have chosen to unify around a filibuster around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward q be deny any other legislative mean of put their proposal forward mr. stephanopoulos i think be -- q any idea mr. stephanopoulos i think their amendment be be defeat i know that be deny q to present them mr. stephanopoulos not exactly true i mean they get the vote -- q that theirs can be pass though by the parliamentary rule under which play mr. stephanopoulos unless they get a majority in support all the way around no not exactly true q george one more on iraq be the administration backing any of the iraqi opposition groom any new leadership q backing any of the iraqi -- leadership mr. stephanopoulos oh i -- again press for iraqi compliance i know if we can get into the business of groom leadership i believe there have be some contact at some level with iraqi opposition group i know about anything recently q jesse jackson who of course be not the president 's best friend have however be told that there be to be some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the president pre-empted the ball game -- los angeles will he consider something like that or any other kind of intervention there mr. stephanopoulos well a you know the president appoint commerce secretary ron brown about 10 day ago to be a special envoy to california and coordiante cabinet activity around the california economic situation include the situation in los angeles i believe there will also be visit out to los angeles by the education -- or have be visit by the education secretary mr. riley i believe that transportation secretary pena and hud secretary cisneros be also go out and there may be other visit by cabinet official over the next several day and week i rule out the possibility of a visit by president clinton to california obviously he be follow the situation closely and be concerned about make sure that we make the right long term policy decision that will help create the kind of economic opportunity which help prevent disturbance but go to continue to watch it q george a a follow-up reverend jackson be also suppose to be outside the ball park today in baltimore with a group of supporter protest the lack of minority in baseball management do the president have a position on that mr. stephanopoulos the president have receive correspondence from reverend jackson i know that reverend jackson have also spoken with the white house chief of staff mack mclarty he clearly raise serious question there have be some progress in baseball over the last several year but still not enough but the president intend to continue to go to the ball game q be he go to say anything about it today or see reverend jackson while out there mr. stephanopoulos i know if he be go to see them but a i say the president believe that reverend jackson have raise some serious question and something that a i say even though there have be progress clearly not enough q do reverend jackson ask him not to go to the ball game mr. stephanopoulos not sure about that i believe the characterization the reverend jackson be talk about be an informational pickett i know that he ask him not to go to the ball game but he sent a long detailed formal letter outline his concern with the situation in major league baseball and the president read it q george the oriole be play the ranger the manage partner of the ranger be george w. bush be he go to be there and be he go to meet with the president mr. stephanopoulos i know q what be the mubarak schedule mr. stephanopoulos i know that president mubarak be come tomorrow morning for a work meeting they will have a lunch and i believe that he be have dinner tonight with vice president gore q and joint statement tomorrow -- mr. stephanopoulos i believe so yes at the end yes q be there evidence george that the egyptian do warn the u.s. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activity mr. stephanopoulos a report in the new york time i mean i think that president mubarak do say that there have be general conversation with the egyptian a there have be for a long period of time we do have general intelligence share i mean but president mubarak be very careful to point out that there be no specific information on this visit that be pass forward the president will continue to investigate the situation but he also reiterates his belief that we can not tolerate terrorism of any kind q george he do make specific -- or the egyptian apparently do issue specific warning about this individual who forgive me -- this individual who forgive me the name escape me at the moment and say the egyptian be more or less rebuffed in their attempt to get some kind of action mr. stephanopoulos again i know if i would agree with your characterization of the mubarak interview he do say that they give general warning about the possibility of a network in the united state and upon which we take appropriate action but there be no specific information on this specific operation at all q so the white house feel that any of the law enforcement agency whether it be the cia or fbi who would have receive this kind of information be lax or derelict in it duty in not pursue some kind of -- mr. stephanopoulos no not at all q what 's next with serbia it get only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday -- mr. stephanopoulos you get to ask your question q yes exactly be there any agreement on concert action between the two country and even if there what do the u.s. do next mr. stephanopoulos i think the u.s. be clearly go to move forward in the u.n. today continue discussion with our ally on a sanction resolution and continue to look for way to press the serbian to come to the negotiate table and sign an agreement q george why do you think sanction be still an option i mean the serbian make it clear that at least the leadership be survive just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration official we have in the other day say there 's no evidence that go to have an effect any time soon the bosnian serb have say no to the peace plan when do no mean no and you have to do something different mr. stephanopoulos well i mean we be do something different move forward on far sanction through the u.n. and those discussion will continue go to continue to try and tighten the noose on serbia and i think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time q be we look again at lift the arm embargo mr. stephanopoulos the president have say that this be something that be under consideration q george do you have any more on hugh rodham 's condition how do mr. stephanopoulos a far a i know nothing 's change q george -- week after mr. mubarak mr. stephanopoulos a little unclear i think be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the mubarak visit q be he go somewhere for easter mr. stephanopoulos not that i know of q what more can you tell u about the additional aid to russia that the president plan to ask congress about mr. stephanopoulos go to be consult with the congress and with our g-7 partner over the next couple of week i know that he spoke last even with congressman gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meet with the russian this week and those consultation will continue over the next several week q do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announce sunday mr. stephanopoulos not go to discus the magnitude q how about the list of cold war restriction where do you stand on that -- mr. stephanopoulos a the president say yesterday go to be look for that list from the congress this week and review it he believe -- go to try and get it this week and go to review the list and go to take a hard look at it q but make it up i mean no white house involvement congress be compile this list mr. stephanopoulos i think go to talk to the congressional leader about compile the list but certain be able to get our own researcher work a well q george lift the arm embargo more of a probability than a possibility mr. stephanopoulos something under discussion q secretary christopher have say that a matter of time and -- for month before that happens mr. stephanopoulos again all i can say be that something that the president be review right now work with our ally in the u.n on a sanction resolution and continue to review other matter q george can you tell u anything about the schedule this week any travel mr. stephanopoulos they just ask about that i have anything more beyond tomorrow 's visit with mubarak right now q be there consultation george with any jewish american organization

b"fine libertarian and anarchist be not alone in be uncomfortable with the use of state sponsor coercion the notion that coercion can be virtually eliminate in a society or more properly that once it be eliminate on the part of the state it be no longer worth serious consideration be a view that be peculiar to libertarian and anarchist for example do `` non-initiated force '' coercion include tax collection do it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envision by adam smith since coercion can be exercise by actor other than the state how be the state to deal with it exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion well i must admit that the picture of libertarian a amway participant be somewhat more reassure than the idea of them try to govern a complex conflictual industrial society venture to point out however that if libertarian convince at least 85 of a group of `` seminar participant '' to `` embrace '' their philosophy their propaganda skill need to be hone frankly however it be no great trick to create a government for a society in which almost everyone be assume to agree about what be a proper government policy once that be assume all sort of annoy formality can be dispense with election police etc and a mr. marx say the state will just wither away on the way there however would you like to explain how eliminate virtually all policy that restrain private coercion in the current society will help u to live happier life or be it like socialism just some short-term pain that have to bear until everyone have have the benefit of `` re-education '' through regular '' seminar '' training jsh"

be of sufficient a general political relevance and b civil liberty interest to warrant keep it active in t.p.m and a.s.c-l a well at least for this round okay now here 's my interpretation of _boomer_ base on the fact a present in the new york court of appeal hold _boomer v. note the new york court of appeal be the high court in new york state while the united state and 48 of the fifty state call their high court `` supreme court '' `` supreme judicial court '' or `` supreme court of appeal '' maryland and new york call theirs simply the `` court of appeal '' to make matter bad new york also call it _second-highest_ court the `` supreme court appellate division '' ... atlantic cement co._ 26 n.y.2d 219 257 n.e.2d 870 1970 oscar h. boomer et al. own land near the atlantic cement company's plant near albany n.y. the fact pattern give no information a to which come first the plaintiff 's acquisition of the land or he defendant 's start of production at their cement plant in the course of it regular operation the cement plant do injury to the plaintiff property via dirt smoke and vibration emanate from the plant the plaintiff sought injunctive relief -- that be they ask the court to order atlantic cement to stop damage their property commentary this seem entirely reasonable to me boomer at al own their property and presumably a right to quiet enjoyment of it atlantic cement 's action be deprive boomer et al of that right instead of grant the plaintiff request for an injunction the court order them to accept the damage be do to their property provide that atlantic cement paid them 185,000 in compensatory damage in other word the court grant atlantic cement co. a private party the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiff right to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain a take by eminent domain be always problematical even when do by the state allow a private firm to do it be in my opinion totally wrong yes i know the _boomer_ court call it eminent domain but if it walk like eminent domain and swim like eminent domain and quack like eminent domain ... let me take issue with the way present the case ... you say that '' what happen in _boomer_ be that the judge allow the plaintiff to blackmail the cement plant by demand a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over 185,000 in damage '' blackmail pull out black 's law dictionary abridge 5th edition ... `` blackmail unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm to injure property to accuse of crime or to expose disgraceful defect this crime be commonly include under extortion statute '' how do you define a `` blackmail '' one party 's act of demand the right to set it own sale price for a unique piece of property which it own and which another party have express an interest in buying or of demand the right not to sell that property at any price a i see it boomer et al have found themselves in the fortunate position of own something which atlantic cement have to purchase if it want to stay in business have every right in the world to set whatever price they want there or at least be any law that say that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealing you go on to say `` the plant would never have be shut down -- the plaintiff 's lawyer would have just negotiate a windfall settlement because the plaintiff would prefer an amount great than 185k to have the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation '' if so so what since when be the court suppose to be in the business of prevent party from reap windfall settlement from other party when those settlement arise from wrongful act by those other party if atlantic cement want to have to face a choice between pay a windfall settlement or go out of business well atlantic cement have thought of that before go _into_ business i note that a far a the fact show boomer et al be _not_ the party responsible for bring about this situation -- that be atlantic cement 's own fault for choose to build and operate the type of plant they do where and when they do and then you say `` everyone 's property right be protect the plaintiff be make whole unnecessary settlement cost be avoid '' a above i dispute your claim that the plaintiff be `` make whole '' they be in fact by court action deprive of their right a owner of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them and for that deprivation they be _not_ make whole and again i ask since when be the court suppose to be in the business of ensure that `` unnecessary '' settlement cost be avoid if so be miseducated -- i always thought that the court be suppose to be in the business of ensure that justice be do 1 _boomer_ be not be taught a `` infamous '' at least not at my school aside northeastern law usually do a very good job of hire for their first-year mandatory class such a tort where i first encounter _boomer_ instructor who regardless of their personal opinion can and do teach the law neutrally when the student get into their second and third year in which the student a can pick and choose which course to take except for the mandatory professional responsibility of course and b be presume to be a bit more worldly and self-confident less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidate by law school professor and able to learn from openly bias instructor rather than be indoctrinate by them the instructor tend to be more open in express their own opinion this be especially true of part-time instructor who in real life be practice attorney or sit judge ... this can be _very_ educational sometimes far more so than be taught by a somewhat cloister scholar end of aside i call it infamous because my opinion of it for the reason state above i believe it to be a triumph of something that i can only call `` economic correctness '' over justice 2 it be `` completely sensible '' only if you believe that the allege right of the owner of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid lose a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the allege right of several hundred atlantic cement employee to not have their job disappear should trump the right of people who own property which be damage by atlantic cement 's wrongful act and if you believe that it be correct for the court or any other branch of government to grant to private party the right to take other people 's property by eminent domain really i know that ... what if anything have he have to say about case like _boomer_ admit that my understand of the field generally refer to a `` law and economics '' be weak if it advocate the use of economical analysis a one of many `` tie-breaker '' factor which court may use to help them reach decision in case in which the dispute a measure by the scale of `` justice '' be evenly balance fine but a illustrate by _boomer_ it be _not_ fine when the court start view the economics of a case a be more important than the justice of a case"
b"this seem a strange argument to make consider that canada's violent crime rate in general be far low than that of the u.s. our non-gun crime rate be great than their *entire* crime rate it would seem strange to suggest that it to be the result of gun control law i think if we look find very specific cultural and enforcement reason why the non-gun rate be low a well and then that reason could be apply to the with-gun rate a easily aside from the fact that i find the idea of be punish because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution it still address the question of canada which be now by the way blame their rise gun-crime rate on the u.s. strange that the border use to `` magically '' keep the gun out but now the other side of the coin of course be that far `` illegal drug '' be purchase legally or steal from people who purchase them legally still not be convince that gun a commodity which criminal have show their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal source steal either from police military or civilian we simply see south american source from which drug come start smuggle gun a well since there 's a thrive gun manufacturing industry down there and a be not point out in the study but in critique of it two seperate article by james wright and david kopel come to mind it be point out that the difference be *also* almost entirely minority related that be the gun crime rate skyrocket for poor minority black and hispanic primarily while when you compare the white majority they be virutally identical the problem with the nejm study be they compare minority vs. non-minority percentage but fail to take into account the relative condition of those minority that there be an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites be about a far a they go they fail to take into account that the non-whites in either city be not living in the same condition if the situation be entirely base on availability of gun then expect that the white rate the two group which be arguably fairly comparative in the two city would have a far high rate in seattle yet the majority in seattle be not only not significantly high when the minority be exclude but slightly low the point be of course that many of the u.s. `` inner-city '' problem be not mirror in canada a such if there be a condition which be significantly different in canada from the u.s. and violent crime be highly correlate to that area suggest that gun control be the source of canada 's low rate be highly questionable a one canadian point out on talk.politics.guns canada 's major gun control in 1978 do not result in either a reduction or a slow of an increase in violent crime rate which have be rise steadily since apparently they even mirror the u.s. very large drop of violent crime in the early eighty true only to a certain extent take washington d.c. where gun control be institute while it have crime problem true but that crime proceed to explode afterwards similarly for new york the question be not simply a point in time where crime be high or low do the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime since go up in those area often faster than it be go up before you simply dismiss the high crime rate by say gun control be cause by it yes gun control may be institute to deal with high crime but if the crime be not positively impact you continually say that that crime rate be entirely a cause of that gun control since much of that crime rate increase after gun control be implement just a happen in canada a would be expect if violent crime be generally independent of gun control would this be the law which make manufacturer liable for what others do with their gun and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them"

b"the white house office of the press secretary pittsburgh pennsylvania ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 17 1993 interview of the president by michael whitely of kdka-am radio pittsburgh pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh pennsylvania 10:40 a.m. edt q for everyone listen on kdka radio mike whitely kdka radio news here at the pittsburgh international airport and with me be the president of the united state bill clinton and like to welcome you to the area and to kdka the president thank you mike glad to be here q there be a lot of thing like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have but some news be just break from los angeles i guess the entire country have be kind of hold their breath wonder what 's go to happen in the trial of the four los angeles police officer we just heard that two of those officer the sergeant sergeant koon and officer powell have be found guilty and two officer have be found not guilty a situation be building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict and i wonder what your thought be this morning on how you see the situation in los angeles in connection with your administration and what try to do the president well first of all i think the american people should know that this trial in my judgment be a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury a well a to the effort of the federal government in develop the case the law under which the officer be try be a complex one the standard of proof be complicate the jury decide that they would convict the sergeant who be responsible for supervise the officer and the officer who on the film do most of the beating the jury acquit an officer who kick rodney king but also plainly try to shield him from some blow and another officer who be a rookie no one know exactly why they do what they do but it appear that they really try to do justice here they acknowledge that his civil right be violate and i think that the american people should take a lot of pride in that but i hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three thing first of all the importance of try to bring this country together and not violate the civil right of any american secondly the importance of renew our fight against crime i think important to recognize that in the poorest area of los angeles and many other city in this country people may be worried about police abuse but even more worried about crime time that we renew our effort to go to community police -- put 100,000 more police officer on the street pas the brady bill that would require a wait period before people could buy a handgun and do some other thing to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drug and the last point like to make be it seem to me that we have get to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our city and other economically-distressed area if you just think about it -- if everybody in los angeles who want a job have one i think have quite a many problem a we do and i laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our city i have dispatch the commerce secretary ron brown to california to try to come up with some strategy for that state because our big state with our high unemployment rate -- which could then be apply around the country i want to talk to him and to the attorney general to the new head of the naacp to reverend jackson and to several other people and then i 'll decide where to go from here with regard to los angeles and the other city of the country q let 's talk about what brings you to the pittsburgh area today there have be -- i guess there 's be a lot of discussion on capitol hill about your stimulus package be lock in a battle with the gop yesterday a you say earlier in your radio address you make some move to break that gridlock what brings you to pittsburgh in particular to allegheny county in particular to pennsylvania with that battle the president well there be two reason first of all pittsburgh allegheny county and pennsylvania support me in the last election because they want a new direction in economic policy we have pass our overall economic plan it give the country a very different budget for the next five year than have in the previous 12. we reduce the deficit and at the same time increase investment in job and education and health care in the thing that will make u a strong country but in addition to that i ask the congress in the short run to spend a little more money a modest amount of money to create another half-million job in the next year and a half to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more the plan pass the house it have the support of a majority of the senate at the present time all the republican senator a a bloc be filibuster the bill that be they let it come to a vote i believe that senator specter would like to vote for the bill and i believe that senator dole the republican leader have put a lot of pressure on a lot of the republican to stay hitch and all say that this bill increase the deficit it this bill be well below the spending target that congress approve include the republican for this year this bill be paid for by budget cut in the next five year this bill be design to give a jump-start to the economy and i must say a lot of the republican senator that be hold it up when mr. bush be president vote for billion of dollar of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it be totally unrelated to create job so what try to do be to break this logjam held out an olive branch offer a compromise but i think that we ought to try to put some more american to work right now to show that change the direction of the country and the purpose of the bill q have you be in touch with senator specter or his office lately the president well be try to talk regularly to -- through my white house congressional liaison operation to the senator that we think be open to this -- senator specter senator d'amato from new york senator jeffords from vermont senator hatfield from oregon and five or six others whom we believe know we need more job in this economy and know that we be pay for this with budget cut over the life of the budget i present you know it have a lot of appeal to say well get a big deficit we increase it more but the truth be that we be pay for this with budget cut in the whole life of the budget over the next few year and more importantly we have this program well below the spending target that congress have already approve for this year and they 've do this for year with the republican voting for it -- many republican voting for it -- for thing that nearly a important a put the american people back to work so i just hope that this become a political issue it ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for job q i have some question from people who support you and some people who be skeptical about your administration it have to do with their hope and also with their fear a lot of people who support you and vote for you in pennsylvania -- i think some of them be now say glad we get him in the white house but now look at this incredible process he have to go through look at these problem look at this gridlock and begin to wonder be this go to work can you pull it off and of course your skeptic be say well i knew it be go to be like this the president well what i would -- ask people first of all to remember that we be frankly move very fast the budget resolution that the congress pass be the fast they have ever pass a budget resolution -- ever -- in history set out the next five-year budget target so we be move really rapidly and get them work on political reform welfare reform health care reform a whole wide range of thing but a big operation you expect to turn it around overnight it take 12 year to produce the condition which lead to the victory i receive from the people in november and we turn it around in 90 day but i think make real real progress i would urge the people not to get discourage not go to win every battle and not everything be go to happen overnight but we be definitely move and change thing q thank you very much the president of the united state bill clinton here live at pittsburgh international airport mike whitely kdka news"

b"the white house office of the press secretary _________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 14 1993 remark by the president at summer job conference hyatt regency crystal city virginia 11:22 a.m. edt the president thank you very much the speech that octavius give say more than anything i will be able to say today about why important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn to merge the nature of learn and work why important to honor the effort of people like jerry levin and nancye comb and pat irving and all of those who be here i want to thank the secretary of labor and education and all the people who work with them for sponsor this and my good friend governor wilder for be here and for speak and all of the business and local community leader from the city and county and state level from around america who be here this have be a pretty fun day laughter i love hearing the young people sing it be music to my ear because it be their future that we be really struggle about applause a year and a half ago i begin the quest to seek the presidency because i be concerned about their future because i believe that our country which have always be a beacon of hope for the young have too little opportunity be too divide among ourselves across line of income and race and region and other way without a vision to take u into the future i enter with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people but in the process we might recreate the best of america 's community know that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future all of you here today be commit to that the 1,000 job that jerry levin have commit time-warner to be symbolic of the commitment make by many of the private sector people who be here and those who be around the country the work that nancye comb do and the success of all the young people like those on this stage and especially the eloquent statement octavius jeffers -- all those thing show that together we know what we need to do and on the right track last july when i be travel across america 's heartland in my luxurious bus i visit seneca high school in louisville kentucky and there i met young people and business people who be participate in the louisville education and employment partnership i saw what nancye comb talk about today i saw how the young people be make an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work i saw a i have see many time in my own state the principle illustrate that octavius have talk about -- that for million of american young people it be really an impediment to both their learn and their ability to be good worker to draw a sharp divide line between what be work and what be learn in the world in which we be living the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight time in a lifetime we must learn to merge the work world and the learn world much well and we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunity that some of them have have showcased here today whether in business or in government or in education you know that we have a big job to do when it come to building a future that really honestly include opportunity for all of our people there be still a lot of people who say well thing be pretty good here in washington and everything 's fine the best thing we can do about this whole thing be nothing they all have job laughter all the people who say that applause they all have health insurance they all have a pretty good education and they all have a pretty secure knowledge that be okay no matter what happens i say that not to be either political or unduly critical but to point out that one of the great challenge of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- be to fully develop the capacity of all of it people and then find work for them to do all the european country have high unemployment rate than we do but also strong support system for the unemployed the japanese unemployment rate have be go up go to adopt a stimulus that even if you count it in it most rigorous term be three or four time big than the one that i have propose to create job in west germany alone the unemployment rate be now about a high a ours this be a big problem for advanced nation it cost a lot of money to add an extra employee with a lot of pressure from low-wage producer in other country that be grow their own economy and try to provide new opportunity for their people but it be especially important for america for two reason one be we have a whole lot of folk who unless we move aggressively will not have the education and skill we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this the second be even if we educate them all if there job they will be robbed of the fruit of their educational labor people need to be able to work in this country applause we have always have some unemployment and indeed some of it be normal always get some people leave job and move around the country and do first one thing and another we have now at this moment in our history the necessity for all big organization include the government to reexamine the way they be organize and who ask whether there be too many people work at some kind of job but in the whole we must still be able to create job in a country like america to provide people with the chance to work go to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposal that i will make to congress in the next couple of month -- go to be hard for me to make those work if at the end of all this work to get off welfare there a job applause so we have two task one be to develop the capacity of the american people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstance of their birth the other be to make sure that there be some opportunity for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be reward with a paycheck it be a great challenge i do not pretend that all of the answer be simple but i know if you want to ask the american people all of them to be more responsible if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridge the line of race and income and region you have get to have opportunity in that mix a part of our vision for america have to be a future for every young person in this country who 's willing to play by the rule and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow there have to be something at the end of that rainbow and that be what we be basically here to talk about today what can we all do a partner recognize none of u can do it alone to develop the capacity of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background and then what can we do to make sure that there 's something there for them to do the summer job program discuss today be an integral part of that plan because it will promote the value of work and opportunity and fairness community it will put the people first and it do have a partnership between the public and private sector i say when i address the united state congress in february on this program that i would seek to create about 700,000 extra summer job from government source and then challenge the american business community to meet that target so that we can create more than a million new summer job over and above what have be create before many many people have respond to that challenge and jerry be just a shin example of that which have be replicate in this room and around the country -- people who be go to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience and it be terribly important i want to emphasize that this summer job program be part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the american people -- from retrain defense worker who lose their job and other adult who need to acquire new skill to improve the transition from school to work for young people who go to college but do need at least two year of post-high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational set so that they can be competitive worker make it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go all these thing be part and parcel of a comprehensive plan also important a i say that we create more job the emergency job program that i ask the congress to adopt would create a half a million extra job over the next year and a half and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent it would also enable u to absorb more young people come into the work force in job that otherwise will not be create it also will help a lot of city and county to invest in thing that need to be do at the grass-roots level -- project long delayed water project sewer project park project new industry and particularly in small and medium-size community -- a whole range of thing that will improve the economy and improve the environment the summer job program be an important part of that because we have try for the first time through the work of the labor department and the education department and through reach out to people like you to make this more than just a one-shot summer job program to integrate it with private sector effort to hopefully replicate it in each come summer to move these young people into far educational opportunity and to far job opportunity and to have a strong meaningful education component to these summer job -- something that the united state government have never fully emphasize before a lot of these young people a you well know because they come from difficult background because they go to school in difficult and challenge circumstance need extra help in building their basic skill in math and language reason and in other area and a lot of educational study show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget a much a 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that have to be repeat the next year what we be try to do here be to give people the opportunity to learn good work habit and to reinforce their learn skill and to put them together and then hopefully over the next couple of year if our entire program pass to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learn environment there will be more apply academic more opportunity for people to learn and work during the school year so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folk but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience a whole new work experience and move on a pathway to a well future the summer job program be not design to be make- work job design to make a future for the people hold the job and what they will do in the process help to build local community to strengthen local economy to solve local problem real job -- renovate housing repair public building do clerical work provide nursing assistance in hospital supervise and training child at child care center and learn all the way challenge young people to learn while they earn but let them earn you know very difficult to make a case to people who have never see opportunity on their own street that they should do this that or the other thing if there 's no evidence of the opportunity at the end of the effort i have not be spar in go for the last year-and-a-half into place where it exactly popular to say it and say i want to reform the welfare system i want to toughen child support i want to require people to work i be sick and tire of people be irresponsible in the use of gun on the street and i want to change all that but if go to summon people to great responsibility you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity applause the young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hour learn basic skill such a math reading write -- either on the job in the classroom they will stretch their mind a well a work up a sweat they will have a sense of accomplishment it will literally be a summer challenge but a challenge that will take them into a different life so i want to ask all of you to support this effort even a i a your president support your effort at the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate see whether they instead of fall behind over the summer academically a too many young people do they stayed even or move ahead i suspect that they will this summer secretary reich and secretary riley and i will be visit many of your community really try to learn from you which of these effort be work what we should do next summer how we can build it in to what go on during the school year how we can build in our job training effort and the work that we do with your company to make sense of this whole thing -- so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investment a well we want to honor the company and the community the business leader and the young people who do the very best job this summer and again i want to say to all of you in private business who have match our effort i thank you and to all of you who and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today i want to implore other private employer to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer tell you we can not go through another 10 year when we give these child anything to say yes to if we exhort them to do right get to be able to reward them applause when the other speaker be talk i be sit up here on the platform listen and revel and they get talk about work and i get to think about all the different thing do to make a living in my life when i be 13 i make a very foolish short-term business investment i set up a comic book stand and sell two trunk full of comic book make more money than i have ever have in my life but if i have save those trunk be worth 100,000 today laughter that do not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial it just mean that you foresee a generation ahead i have mow yard and clear land and built house and work in body shop and the part department of a car dealership and do a lot of different thing for a living some people say i get into politics to escape work laughter i learn something from every job i ever have but i grow up in a generation where i literally do not know a living soul without regard to race or income who want to work who have a job i grow up in a generation when all you have to really say to people be get an education and be all right get a job and make more money next year than you do this year now i live in a generation full of people most of whom make any more money in real dollar than they do 10 year ago and work longer hour and pay more for the basic of life and we be now wonder whether we can create the job that these young people want now i want to close by reemphasizing these two thing it matter what kind of economic policy this administration pursues or how much productivity increase there be in the private sector if young american get a good education learn how to work and be productive those job will not be create in this country machine will do the work or the work will be do off-shore by people who have the same skill level and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wage so nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skill and capacity of america 's work force and anybody that pretend otherwise be just kid on the other hand we need to be honest every wealthy country in the world include the united state be have difficulty create job if i knew everything that need to be do be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliberation of congress and everything else i have all the answer but i know this do nothing be not the answer applause and so the job program that i have present to congress with the summer job with the money for the city and the county through the community development program with the infrastructure money be a small part of a big budget it be an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not with the economy recover in term of corporate profit we can give a little boost to it give opportunity to young people create a half a million job and maybe get the engine go again most of the job in this program be go to be job in the private sector not government job even though government money and the lion 's share of the work in rebuild the american economy obviously will come from the private sector the kind of system we have and it work pretty well but this be the challenge we have so i ask all of you here today to support the summer job program to ask your friend and neighbor to support it to go back home and ask your employer to make a little extra effort to do what you can to help me pas the fund to create the 700,000 job that the united state government should create this summer so that together we can have this partnership because more than anything else we have to give a future -- a future that our young people can believe in we need to send them a message that here in america if you study hard and work hard if you obey the law and contribute something to your community you will be reward by your country you can build a future from you own dream that have always be the promise of america together what this summer of challenge need to be a reaffirmation of the promise of america for so many young people to whom that promise have be an illusion we can make it a reality thank you very much applause"
b"horror appeal to popular principle can we perhaps a the question of whether the constitution might have be write to appeal to the principle rather than a you appear to believe it be write with something else in mind and `` propoganda '' put out by it supporter but let 's be honest about something here when be the last time you brought up all the valid point against your own argument or be they simply propogranda we know what phill *really* mean because obviously use argument design to convince if true or false regardles of why they be say why on earth do you make a point of call them `` propogranda '' that would seem to be irrelevent oh i have no argument with question them i believe they no longer apply but because i think most of them be good argument not entirely happy about the situation because they be obviously only apply to a minority of the time but i think that alone be sufficient to invalidate them since the u.s. constitution be the basis for the u.s. political system most change in it would require constitutional change in this particular case however the fillibuster be a matter of procedure and tradition it only *should* have be make part of the constitution in principle no that they have less power of that they should have have less power phill discusing the power of legislative house while the prime minister *is* member of parliament he be more analgous although badly to the u.s. president now please explain to me how the u.s. house of representative be `` in principle '' more powerful than the house of lord or the senate but in practice be less be you suggest that the writer of the constitution *really* intend for them to be more powerful but gosh darn the thing be ratify before they realize forgotten to put those extra restriction on the senate in not at all a any entry level political science course will tell you people who want law implement will always choose the level of government to `` attack '' which present them with the best chance of get what they want with national `` interest group '' it be simply a very rational thing to do to want the federal government to enact a law rather than the state less people to persuade and less '' contribution '' to make why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the federal level simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefield be won by extension the same extends to insurance medicine and most other question local government have not `` fail '' in that it do what it should but that it be dominate by local interest thus non-local interest who want locality to abide by their rule get their rule past the local government thus since they 've get more clout only in the wrong place they appeal to the next high level because it can impose it will on the low i mean let 's get real here do we *really* need the congres of the united state decide that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern or that *carjacking* need to be a federal a oppose to a local crime the more people want the more congress will take power to `` sell '' it to them for their vote i think the rise of `` special interest '' be coincidence with the increase power of congress bingo the high up the governmental ladder the less actual need matter because political power can be concentrate at high level while people with less cloud only find themselves reduce to in effectiveness then why not simply leave new york 's education to new york i remain unconcinved that there be any state in the union which be not capable of educate it own child if what they want to do and if you leave it to them you only have to worry about the `` pork '' in that state and since industry concentrate their political power and wealth rather they must divide it among the state to try and get what they want individual voice have more relative impact the problem with the fillibuster be not that you must `` buy off '' state but that the congress have acquire too much power to sell pork but why on earth should we want to redirect it you say yourself that you have to sell pork to get thing through congress if congres have less authority to sell pork and retains it authority to enact national legislation within it grant jurisdiction the pork problem be significantly reduce the current block essentially state that inaction be preferable to action thus it the system be weight against action consider the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce it decision by force i consider bias against make those decision a good thing the difference with the low pyramid be that a they have more legal legitimate authority in most matter under our constitution than the federal government and b at those low level power be harder to concentrate and c you get the benefit of not impose new deicisons on everybody at once you get to see them try out without a national decision congressional action usually treat the entire country a a whole yet even with similar problem in different area different solution may be call for and while i often agree with the decision my local and state rep make at least i have a well option of go to the city council and shoot my mouth off much rather the majority of law be make by accessible people who hang around and end up have to put up with them rather than somebody far off in washington with half a million or more constituent curious what you base your assumption that low level be more corrupt phill *you* brought up the federalist paper we be argue the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of senator should be allow to hold up a bill you claimed the senate be suppose to be a far less powerful house and i contend there be nothing in the constitution or other writing which indicate this which be when you brought up that we decide what the founder want base on the federalist paper you argue against them i never argue from them i have primarily refer to the constitution which place only very small restriction on the senate than for the house the u.s. constitution be a nuts-and-bolts document the delcaration of independence be the high-brow reason there be a couple of other example though such a the reason for the power to tax and the reason for the power to grant permit both in article i section 8 to a certain extend i do believe the veto have become something it intend however i also believe it be inevitable consider the congress own abuse of their power to make bill say whatever they want them to say unlike most people i think we be worry about the veto which be fine but of the problem in congress which almost necessitates it abuse *bush phill absurd bush have *37* veto one of which be over-ridden go read up on fdr if you think anything resemble a record why not what be inherently wrong with biasing the system against action historically governemnt action in the u.s. when deal with issue with a bare minority and a large minority have not be successful when in a position of impose federal power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to get through something more than a bare majority now switch from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill i see how it make a difference sure arguable theyr e *arguing* it however require 60 to bring it to a vote ensures that have to have a *good* argument something that base solely on party line no i be completely happy with a system which require a minority for *action* since u.s. history be a history of carve up population group and implement piece-meal on minority i feel minority should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about and 41 be hardly a tiny minority i advocate the minority be capable of initiate actionm but i see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action"

b"candidate clinton promise to tax the rich and most folk thought that be a pretty nifty idea then president clinton say he want family who make more than 100,000 to bear 70 of the new tax burden and many be quick to complain that their six-figure income do not make them one of the well-to-do particularly ironic to me that in those traditionally liberal enclave of the bay area and academia where the wealthy be struggle so to fit themselves into the mantle of `` just regular working-class folk '' nobody will ever admit to be rich everybody 's middle class so who be the rich well i 'll throw out some stats from the 1990 census and let you be the judge ... va negvpyr mzimmersc5e1qk.fn9 netcom.com mzimmers netcom.com michael zimmer jevgrf in article 1qcdvbinn5ti elroy.jpl.nasa.gov ... that would be about 55 to 65 thousand u and that be what tenure professor can expect to make for a phd with say 10 year experience 65,000 be a lot less than what he could be make in industry. oh a a 12-year veteran of silicon valley see precious few employment ad that call for phd and 65k be hardly chump change well above the median *household* income for the state bay area average household income be in the mid- 40,000 range national average be 31,889 the bay area have nearly twice the national average of six-figure income household 9.1 v 4.8 the cost-of-living here may be high but i think twice the national average ... in los angeles modest home price can be 500,000 a 1,500-square-foot tract house in a bay area working-class neighborhood go for about 250,000 i doubt that the los angeles market be all that different it would appear that this definition of `` modest '' be perhaps a bit immoderate ... so what no cheaper for those who be gainfully employed. in california 65,000 be not upper-middle-class. it depends upon your definition clearly above average it be more than what two-thirds of california household make seem to me that belonging to the upper one-third be not an unreasonable definition of `` upper-middle-class '' note that if that professor's spouse earns 35,000 they become one of clinton 's `` rich '' family here 's a breakdown of national california and bay area household income 30k 30-50k 50-100k 100k+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- u 49 24 23 4 the census bureau do some weird ca 41 26 26 7 round here ... more like 5 ba 34 25 31 9 and to add a little prespective a minimum wage earner work 40 hours/week make 8,840/year the poverty line for a family of four be 15,171 if they make up to twice that the government considers them to be `` work poor '' say we decide to call this the `` lower-middle-class '' then how 'bout 30-50k annual income be `` middle-class '' 50-100k be `` upper-middle-class '' 100k+ be `` rich '' 1,000k+ be `` filthy-rich '' and 10,000+ be `` bill gate '' make sense -timr"

status to help prove my assertion also post two article from usa today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age group *is* on the rise if wod be work a lead to believe then drug abuse should have go down substantially by now the reality be be that it have not go down very much if anything substance abuse be on the rise also go to supply a possible solution to this problem the follow text be an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitle `` hello again mary jane '' which appear in the current issue of time magazine april 19 1993 p. 59 law-enforcement official say pot advocate be just blowing smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed `` perhaps because of the change of administration the marijuana lobby be out in full force '' say robert bonner head of the drug enforcement administration `` the fact be lose the battle '' in 1985 more than 23 of youth age 12 to 17 say they smoke marijuana in 1991 that figure be 13 and bonner say it be still

report we be not win the `` war on drug '' i think you can see that one of the tactic that the dea employ to give people the impression that the `` war on drug '' be be won be to selectively quote statistic -- only statistic that support their contention that drug use have go down the excerpt from time magazine that i include in this post be an excellent example of how organization like the dea attempt to deceive the public usage of *one* particular drug may have go down but at the same time usage of other drug may have go *up* a.k.a substitution also drug usage among *one* particular age group may have go down but drug usage among another age group may have go *up* therefore if one take a look at the big picture take into consideration *all* the statistic then obvious that the so-called `` war on drug '' be be lose perhaps the drug war be be won a far a illegal drug go but if one factor in alcohol abuse smoking and use of inhalant then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then place in it true perspective for those of you who consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that not a drug agency like the dea only go after *illegal* drug this be one of the reason why the drug war be a fruitless attempt at prevent substance abuse -- -people will merely switch to another drug if the one they be use becomes scarce or unpopular the solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some -- -not all -- -drugs whose toxicity have be show to be within reasonable limit you drop dead after use it a few time and then couple this with a massive drug education program the reason why i think legalization be *part* of the solution be because people seem to be able to easily obtain drug despite the government 's effort to the contrary -- -the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere e.g. drug education additionally legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be take out of drug traffic which often go along with other kind of crime not to mention the fact that addict would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit legalization would cause the street price of drug to fall substantially so drug would be much more affordable to addict imho the way to reduce substance abuse be to do to drug what have be do to smoker make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerate them a you already know people in the u.s. smoke a lot less than they use to this reduction in the number of smoker have be brought about by public awareness campaign law restrict where people can light up warn label on cigarette package taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption and so on i propose that similar method be use to reduce substance abuse after legalization have be carry out they be a follow drug be sell must come with clear concise information which state the possible health hazzards involve with use this product and recommendation on how the drug should be use thing like dosage level and how long the drug should be use ought to accompany the packaging the drug be contain in all drug should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high a to encourage people to acquire drug through illegal channel part of the revenue collect from drug tax should be use to fund drug education and law enforcement make it a felony to sell drug to minor people under the age of 18 anyone can sell drug but they must not dodge pay the tax on drug or sell drug with the warn information absent failure to pay the appropiate tax on drug or omit warn information should also be a felony establish a government agency whose job be to insure that the purity and safety of all drug be a high a possible this agency would try to prevent people from get a hold of bad drug -- -something that be a fairly serious problem now sure that many of the thing discuss in this article have be hash out before in this newsgroup nevertheless i thought it be a good idea to give my two cent actually a buck and a half ... all at once so you could get a good idea of where i currently stand on wod go ahead and tear into my post sure there be something in it that you

1993 canada place vancouver british columbia 9:40 a.m. pst folk about to start the background briefing on the aid package senior administration official good morning the president -- president clinton and president yeltsin agree yesterday on a series of american initiative to support economic and political reform in russia and value at 1.6 billion before take your question and run through the basic outline of this package i want to make a few point first this be the maximum that the clinton administration can do with available fund to support russian reform all of the fund have be allocate and appropriate by the congress there be no need for the administration to go back to the congress to fund any of these program all our fiscal year '93 fund currently be available so in effect all of these program can begin tomorrow the second point be that this package be design to support russian reformer all of the initiative in the package be direct at reformer and for their benefit and all have be work out with prior consultation with the russian government third the president be determine that we will deliver on these commitment this year the package be design to maximize our ability to support reform in design it we want to avoid make commitment that we could not meet and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitment in front of you fourth like to note the special importance of trade and investment i think fair to say that russia 's capital and technology need throughout the next decade extend well into the hundred of billion of dollar no collection of government can meet those need only the private sector can do so and so the president and president yeltsin agree to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship they also agree that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space form head on the u.s. side by vice president gore on the russian side by prime minister chernomyrdin and the goal of this effort be to break through the barrier to trade and investment on both side and to promote a vastly expand relationship if it would be helpful be prepared to run down the first page which be a summary of u.s. assistance and just give you some general background on what these program be i 'll do it quickly and then i 'll be glad to take question the first group of initiative be humanitarian food and medical assistance this be part of our effort which have be underway for several year to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure there 's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelf in the major city 194 million in grant -- that be from food for progress the grant portion of food for progress also be continue our grant assistance in medicine and pharmaceutical supply and 30 million the second item be concessional food sale a you know the united state have have a long-term grain relationship with russia important to u and important to russia that we continue that relationship the president have chosen the food for progress program which be a concessional loan program the value over the next seven month be 700 million these be concessional term the exact term have not be work out but i think fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven year and concessional rate thereafter for the life of the deal the third program be a collection of private sector support we think this be one of the most important thing go to do privatization and the creation of small business be the number one priority of the reform government in moscow and so the president have decide to create a russian-american enterprise fund capitalize this year at 50 million and the goal of this fund be to make direct loan to small business in russia to take equity position in those business the president have also decide to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the russian government in it priority objective of try to convert state enterprise from a state-owned basis to a private basis he have also agree -- the president have also agree to establish a eurasia foundation this would be a private foundation lead by prominent american to fund democratization project in russia the fourth group you see there in the summary page be democratization itself i think fair to say that this administration have give a new impetus to the goal of pursue democratization in russia you see that we have a total of 48 million in program various program the detailed table give an indication of some of the program that launch the president be also call for the development of a democracy corp which will be an overarch umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public effort now underway from the united state to support reform in russia the fifth program you see be russian office of resettlement this be a new initiative create and conceptualize by this administration this be a demonstration project what like to do be work with the russian military to help resettle russian officer return from the baltic state and other part of the former soviet union we want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that whether with russian labor and russian material or use prefab american construction and so decide to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing unit be work very closely with the russian military on this and i would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project the sixth area be energy in the environment they be two issue that the president feel strongly about our initial effort will be feasibility study to look into the possibility of enhance their energy production both oil and gas and equally important try to cut down on the leakage in the oil and gas pipeline system which cause so much environmental damage talk a little bit about trade and investment about the new group be create that the vice president will chair on our side secretary ron brown will also be cochairing with deputy prime minister shohkin a business development committee which will work in all other sector of the economy to break down the many barrier that currently exist and impede trade and investment we be also go to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the american government to work on this problem full-time and the point like to make here be trade and investment in the 1990s be every bit a important to draw an analogy a arm reduction be in the '70s and '80s and we just thought that in look at this we need to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis because it be terribly important notice that the united state be go to support russia 's membership in the gatt russia have have observer status russia have request our support and in fact request our advice in become a member of the gatt we think that the long-term goal of draw russia into the global economy be paramount a very important goal and that be why we be support the membership in the gatt we be also support their access to gsp the generalize system of preference note that ex-im have extend 82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia that opic have extend 150 million in credit and loan guarantee for a conoco oil project like to emphasize that we be very close to an agreement between russia and the united state for a 2-billion framework facility through the ex-im bank that would finance russian purchase of american oil and gas equipment and service we think this be a very important development we think get there by april 14th which be the opening day of the tokyo conference the g-7 conference before i take any far question like to defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance objective with you senior administration official our major unfinished agenda with the russian and with their counterpart in ukraine kazakhstan and belarus be in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenal on their territory under the term of the start i and start ii agreement recently we complete in moscow three i think very important agreement that devote a significant chunk of nunn-lugar funding to three important program the first be the program of 130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program that be for submarine for icbm dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- 130 million the second be a 75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear material remove from the warhead a they be dismantle this will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phase of the construction of that storage facility and finally a 10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear material a they be withdrawn from the weapon system so we add that 215-million total to the extant nunn-lugar assistance which have be flow -- about 150 million for some overall safety improvement for various kind of equipment and safety measure that we have be work out with the russian over the last couple of year so this be an area where we will be go a lot more work with not only the russian but with the ukrainian kazhaks and belarussians belarus for example have just in the last couple of week receive up to 65 million in fy'93 fund for safety security and dismantlement program on belarussian territory and this be in the wake of their ratification of start i an agreement to accede to npt so we be work very hard with all the party to the lisbon protocol and will continue to work very hard with them and i look upon these three recent agreement with russia a a very important step in that process q the opic fund to -- be that for the field in kazhakstan -- and conoco already sign this deal with kazhakstan why do you feel now it be necessary -- if the same one why do you feel necessary senior administration official not the same deal chevron sign a deal with kazhakstan the tenge oil field this be a new investment project a polar light oil development and renovation project and be announce today so completely new q can you tell u more about what 's involve senior administration official yes conoco like other american oil company have be search for way to do two thing one to prospect for new oil in siberia west siberia and two to try to get into the business of renovate oil well and renovate pipeline both oil and gas in russia the objective here obviously be to take advantage of the natural resource in russia increase energy production which will in turn increase hard currency revenue which be what russia need so we think this deal be very very good development for russia the russian do a well and good for an american company and the american government have played a lead role in pull this together through the credit facility in opic and through the loan guarantee q so to search and also to renovate field that be already there senior administration official right q on that point should other american company expect to get administration support for such deal or should they now go to the ex-im and try to get the money out of the 2 billion senior administration official well a you know ex-im be part of the u.s. government and various part of the u.s. government have be push include the state department and the white house for this deal to be consummate and we think it will and if we arrive at this agreement by april 14th there will be 2 billion in financing available for american company to sell their equipment and sell their service q that should take up all of the rest of the deal and their be -- and their will or there be support for opic sort of deal such a this conoco senior administration official there 's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of american oil and gas company to invest in russia we think that the ex-im oil and gas facility the 2-billion facility once it be conclude will soak up a lot of that interest but i think the interest may even extend beyond that and if so the government will respond q what 's the current year budget cost of that 2-billion agreement should it go forward and be there any current year budget cost -- senior administration official i 'll have to refer you to ex-im for that i know the detail of that q the concessional food sale -- be there any current year cost to that or be it delayed until the year in which the payment be due senior administration official the concessional food sale be from food for progress which be a usda program usda have the fund we need to go back to the congress to expend those fund there will be a hit in the budget refer you to usda and omb for the detail on that q can you talk about the democracy corp q and the private sector -- how many folk be go to be involve in that senior administration official why i start with the democracy corp first i think the administration felt come into office that there be literally thousand of organization private organization in the united state that in one way or another be work at the goal of try to achieve democratization in russia help on a farmer-to-farmer basis and there be literally 10 or 15 u.s. government agency that have a variety of program in this area and so the administration felt -- the president felt it be important to try to draw all of these initiative together under one group to give some coherence to the effort and to give some impetus to the effort and so this be a presidential initiative it will be head by ambassador tom simon who will soon take up his duty a the coordinator for u.s. assistance in the former soviet union and very hopeful that we might use this democracy corp not only to draw upon the resource of our own government but the resource of the american private sector and school and community across the nation q any kind of commitment yet any kind of word yet on fy'94 and any new money that need to be appropriate besides the 300 million the president talk about senior administration official the administration be request additional fund in fy'94 of 700 million what the president have do this weekend be to consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measure the united state could take in some of these area to support reform be consult with the congress when he return to washington be consult also with the other ally government and make a decision at that time q two question about the 700 billion agricultural money first of all i thought it be the sort of consensus that what russia do not need be more loan for food so why do you decide to do it that way secondly could you explain -- agriculture have be stop from make far loan for food because of russia 's inability to pay how do this fit into that situation senior administration official a you know the united state for a long time have be a major supplier of grain and food commodity agricultural product to russia i think between 1991 and '92 we have extend -- a little bit of history here -- about 5.5 billion in credit credit guarantee through the commodity credit corporation that be the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of american grain product on december 1 of last year '92 the russian government stop it payment on that program they be now in arrears to u on that program and therefore by law the united state can not continue that program and so the president work with secretary espy and other official in the cabinet look for other way that we could promote american grain sale and i think we have two way to do that announce today 194 million in grant food assistance through the food for progress program but we do not have sufficient authority to spend 700 million in grant food and so we look for a concessional loan program i think everybody agrees that russia -- that a short-term loan program for russia would not make sense now but a long-term concessional loan program would and that be what this program be it will provide once the final detail be work out for a six to seven-year grace period on payment of principal and then from year seven through 15 which be the life of the deal it will provide for concessional rate of interest -- generally around three to four percent and so we believe and the russian government believe this be a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payment and put them into the out year but it will also continue this very important grain relationship which be important for them and important for the american farm community q i gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the russian failure to pay the interest on ecc loan do not in any way affect this kind of loan go through be that right senior administration official let me be explicit about that we be prevent under the law to from continue the commodity credit corporation short-term credit program because of russia 's arrearages to the united state all of you know about those arrearages they total about i think around 640 million usda can give you an exact figure so have take that into consideration and want to preserve american market share and a long-term grain relationship want to respond to a specific request from the russian government for major food assistance know that we take it from the grant program because we have sufficient authority there we look at food for progress which be a program use to great effect in other part of the world and we consult with the russian government and arrive at this solution i think the russian be pleased because it provide them with the food but also give them a little bit of relief on the short-term payment q where do those fund actually come from senior administration official they come from the food for progress program which be a program under usda 's authority usda have the authority to spend these fund we do not need to go back to the congress for these fund and i want to make that general point again everything in this package the 1.6 billion package comprises fund that have already be allocate and appropriate by the congress the administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow and very important in our eye that we expend all the fund this year that we meet these commitment and we be confident be able to do so q how do you arrive at the figure of 700 million -- do that max out that program or do you actually have a range from 0 to -- senior administration official there 's a reason for it the reason be that the russian government told u about the amount of grain that they need between now and harvest time and so the idea be that we would begin the shipment probably 100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which time russia require the same level of food import from the west q i would imagine there 's go to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republic because of the size and the scope of this with russia have you give any consideration to advance negotiation for the same kind of project with the ukraine with georgia with some of the other republic senior administration official yes very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extend american support to the 11 other country of the former soviet union we have told ourselves and we have plan that in the area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that you see roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to russia and roughly 50 percent to the other country in the area of food sale we have be active with ukraine in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia we will continue that and i think fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our program with the other country to ensure that they be adequate and they be productive and hard-hitting q have anything happen at the summit to lead american energy company and other company to believe that russia be go to be more user-friendly toward them in term of tax legality bureaucracy senior administration official well one of our primary objective come into this summit be to highlight not only the economic agenda but also trade and investment and like to refer to the point i make at the begin convince in talk about this problem -- the problem of how to support russia long-term -- convince that no collection of western government have the financial resource over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private sector can do that we look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resource in the oil and gas sector it be a very good match with what the russian need now which be financial investment in the exist oil and gas well and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production what the russian government have told u it want to do and so why we have make such a major emphasis on it why trade and investment be a prominent issue on the first day of these talk and in fact figure prominently last night in the meeting between president yeltsin and president clinton and hop that together we might send a strong signal to the american business community that we support their effort to invest in russia that the united state through ex- im and opec and the department of commerce will be there to support them q my question be be yeltsin in any position to deliver on make russia a more -- senior administration official we think he be i would note that president yeltsin 's prime minister mr. chernomyrdin work for 30 year in the russian oil and gas sector he will now chair a high-level commission with the vice president vice president gore to try to break through the barrier that currently exist to western investment in the oil and gas sector we believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee and look forward to the work q what type of mechanism be already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program and will the u.s. be directly involve in the tail end of distribution of the actual fund or be the money simply turn over to the russian government for distribution at their will senior administration official be you talk about the variety of program list here it depends on the program itself in most case though we be either work through american pbos or american government agency to ensure that the money obviously be well spent that the money get to the intend source an obligation we have to the congress to ensure the money be well spent and that we can account for the money we have do that in the last couple of month intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these program but they be all quite different for instance in the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it be carry out through usda and usda account for the delivery of the food for grant medical assistance be work through project hope which be a private organization for the housing -- for instance the resettlement of russian officer be work with a group of american pbos on some of the democratization project work directly with russian private individual and private foundation work with journalist in russia on a medium project that you may have notice so we literally have here 30 to 40 different activity under all these rubric and all go to be carry out in slightly different way some directly with the russian government some with russian citizen q the jackson-vanik restriction that remain and on the cocom restriction that remain can you tell u what the president have to do on that senior administration official well a george note yesterday president yeltsin raise these a irritant in the relationship the president have note that i think fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to washington and look at both of these question and get back to the russian government q you be not prepared for these question when you get here senior administration official we be prepared for these question look at them but not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend they require -- let me just explain particularly on jackson-vanik they require consultation with the congress they require consultation with the american jewish community and very sensitive to those concern and so want to go back and talk to them before we take any action q be this package design so that you will not have to go to congress for anything at this point senior administration official a i say at the begin the advantage of this particular package be that all the fund have be allocate and appropriate by the congress so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these effort in effect they can all begin tomorrow and i know that many of the agency responsible for these project will begin tomorrow and the advantage of this particular initiative q if this a the president say be a long-term long-haul thing and member of congress be at this moment head for moscow why you talk about go to congress and suggest to the president of russia that you be prepared to go to congress for various thing senior administration official i think be clear about that the president be discuss this weekend with president yeltsin some additional idea that we have for american funding of additional project and idea that he have we have a major congressional delegation that left last night head by representative gephardt and want to consult with that delegation and other member of congress before do anything and also want to consult with our ally so where it stand now q be told repeatedly that a number of these item represent different or new way of spending the money already appropriate could you just tick off which of these item represent reprogramming or at least spending money in way that it be not previously set to be senior administration official i think that say that these be all project that either congress have allocate money for through the freedom support act there be some fund that be left over from fy'92 and this administration take office and have some new idea about how the fund might be expend we use just the freedom support act fund or the fy'92 fund we go into some of the agency allocation -- ex-im opic and usda -- and try to look for creative way to far our program and example of that be the food for progress concessional loan we have hit a brick wall with another type of funding through usda we could not go forward legally and so we look for a more creative way to ensure continued american market share and ensure continued grain sale and we think we found it q where for example be you get the money for this russian officer resettlement -- senior administration official from the freedom support act fund q in other word all of the money be be directly spent in new way so to speak -- senior administration official most of the grant project that you see -- if you look at the general chart the second chart broken down into grant and credit and if you look under grant the technical cooperation project that total 281.9 million -- that be almost all freedom support act funding a little bit of it be leftover fund from fiscal year '92 the nunn-lugar fund of course you know about the legislative history of those fund q cooperation -- senior administration official from fy '92 i have the exact figure it be not a considerable figure q could you tell u please have anything happen here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and russia over start -- for start i and ii a a result of what 's happen here -- senior administration official both president president yeltsin and president clinton will be discuss this issue this morning in fact we yet gotten to security and arm control related issue that will be this morning 's session i know that president clinton will be very strongly reinforce that this be a top priority for u be talk to the russian and the ukrainian over the last couple of week about way that we might help to facilitate the discussion between them up to this point this have be a very important negotiation be go on essentially between moscow and kiev and we be at the point now of essentially discuss with them if there be way that we could contribute to this discussion help to move thing forward essentially but in term of what be come out of this weekend i yet know in a couple hour know q just a follow-up on the financing here be any of this rob peter to pay boris -- since all current year appropriation have you take it from anyplace be earmark and put it into this fund senior administration official there be smoke and mirror here and i think an important point to note we could have give you a page of assistance number that include out-year funding go to make a long-term commitment to many of these project -- for instance the enterprise fund the privatization effort the housing effort and already talk to the russian about our long-term commitment we could have put in really big number and this could have be a big package but we want to make a point this package be fy '93 fund that we have and go to do what we say go to do and the president feel very strongly about that in the past there be a legacy that the western government the combination of government put up large budget figure and for any number of reason not able to meet them determine and the president be determine to carry out every single program in this package and do it but we do have a longer-term commitment and part of the discussion on economics this weekend look for russian idea on what it be we can do to most effectively support reform and told them that we do have a commitment on some of these program beyond this fiscal year q take it way from any -- senior administration official no we okay the question be have we reprogrammed any of these fund so have we take it from other country to pay for program in russia the answer be no we have not do so q in term of funding there be no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else that in fact support the -- theory senior administration official not at all i think it do a particular example and the example be grain sale the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program be short-term loan that russia have to pay back within 12 to 15 month you all know about russia 's debt problem and russia be unable to meet those commitment so we look for a way to do two thing to meet russia 's requirement for grain a net grain importer on a massive scale and also meet our objective of make sure that the american farmer have a chance to sell their product to russia and we simply look for another way to finance that and we have legislative authority to do it this program have be successful in other area we have not try it before in the former soviet union but we thought we should now q this really the bush-clinton aid package for russia since these fund be really first derive by initiative put forward by president bush senior administration official no i think a fair characterization a lot of these fund be appropriate by the u.s. congress be 1991 in 1992. this administration take office and inherit some obligation that the bush administration have make but we have a long six to seven week review of this program we decide to meet the commitment that have be make by the previous administration but we have go well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund which be just an idea but the idea have not be fill out with a program there be no number attach to it in group together some project and try to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort i would say be another clinton initiative far we listen to the russian government and listen to the russian military who told u that the resettlement of their officer be important to them for political and economic and social reason and president clinton have respond to that and we be make a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project go to figure out a way to do much more in try to settle those officer i would also say that the president have give impetus to all of u in the agency to think much more broadly about what it be we can do on democratization because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the russian experience and in call for the creation of a democracy corp which be another new initiative hopeful that we can take the resource of the private sector a well a the american government to achieve that objective so i would not characterize it that way at all and a most of you know i be a career civil servant i be in the last administration very familiar with what the last administration do and i would characterize this a a clinton assistance package for russia q there 's be a lot of criticism that aid in the past have not gotten to the people be there anything in this outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because be administer by the russian government senior administration official i think that -- i know that the president and other senior official of our government be concerned that american money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that intend -- for which intend and so go to take great care -- aid and the state department will take great care in make sure that the fund be expend properly and that reach their source i would not that this package be not simply a package of support solely to the russian government some of these project especially in democratization and exchange be go to be work out directly with russian private individual with business the private enterprise support be another example of that senior administration official if i could just add a word on this point with regard to the ssd-related program one area that be look at very very closely be consideration of actually use russian firm in subcontract for these kind of program they would be work very closely of course with the american firm who would be the prime contractor but this be a fine example i think of a more -- of a imaginative and flexible approach toward get some of that funding down to the grassroots level down to the ground in russia but at the same time ensure that it be spent efficiently and for the purpose for which it be intend q when would the democracy corp start exactly when do you see this happen how would get it off the ground senior administration official well the president be today call for the creation of a democracy corp i think fair to say that go to work out it framework over the next couple of week ambassador simon take up his duty on may 1st but in effect already start because over the last couple of week the administration have begin to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to u ask u to help facilitate their activity in russia and say that we will be helpful also try to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activity of our own government we do have 10 or 15 agency that be active in russia in one way or another we think it make sense to draw them together and to focus their effort q excuse me how much of this 1.6 billion will actually be spent in the united state by american make good senior administration official i have any figure for you now but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of day on that q this figure be large than the figure that have be in the press -- do this program grow yesterday a a result of the discussion or have we just be that far off the mark senior administration official no i think -- unfortunately the press have be a little bit off the mark and sorry to say that no this package -- president clinton put u to work about seven week ago on this package and he be briefed intensively on this he contribute a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package he contribute a lot of the idea in the package and i think fair to say that we have this rough package work out about two week ago we have be refining it ever since we spent a couple of day last week go over it with the russian government both the embassy in washington and the government in moscow through our own embassy and so be evolve but this particular package have be together for about two week q where be yeltsin 's input into this then there be so much talk before about the president want to get yeltsin 's view about specifically what be need and so forth be that in the out year senior administration official no both president yeltsin have on several occasion told u for instance that support for the creation of private business be important to him that the resettlement of russian military officer be important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industry be important to them and so what we do be to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package we listen to him on the privatization effort we have be work with the russian government for month on this try to work out all the detail so the russian government on most of these program be involve every step of the way but let me get at the other part of your question the president be also use this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiative that we might undertake and look for his idea the president have brought his own idea to the table -- for instance on energy and the environment and in housing but look for russian idea not we need to consult with the congress and we need to consult with the other allied government that be also active q there 's essentially nothing that happen in the last day and a half that measurably alter the package that you come in with senior administration official this particular package a i say be work out and be ready about two week ago we have since then consult with the russian government on the final stage of it development and so this weekend primarily talk about future about what more the united state and other western country can do to support reform in russia which be our base objective here q i notice that you -- that money appropriate to train banker and businessmen and officer can you tell me what about job training for worker who be displace by privatization senior administration official right we have a program to train russian -- young russian in banking and financial service in the united state part of the housing initiative not just to build housing unit to retrain russian officer who be retire into other profession q money for job training for worker whose job be disappear because of privatization -- senior administration official we have not yet allocate any money for that q why not q of the 6 million be go to build 450 housing unit that a lot of money per unit give what the western dollar will buy in the former soviet union senior administration official if you want to do housing the right way not just the building the framework of a house get to think about all the utility get to think about the purchase of land get to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth and also retrain not enough to put retire -- an officer come out of -- riga or tallin or vilnius in a house in western russia we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officer a well this be respond to a request from the russian government q of the 6 million will go to retrain -- senior administration official right q be you talk about apartment building or single -- senior administration official talk about single individual dwelling q say that only 450 family will be serve by this senior administration official what i want to -- i thought i point out earlier this be a demonstration project what we want to do -- give the experience that the german and the turk and the italian have have in building housing in western russian we do not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money what we want to do be work over the next couple of month and try to figure out with american organization in the private sector the best way to get this job do i note that we have a long-term commitment to that and so i would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future but we want to do it wisely we want to spend the money wisely q what be it about this program that convinces you that it will protect russia 's reform and that russia will be in a position to may back the money suppose to pay back especially consider their other debt problem senior administration official well look i think important to note that the united state on it own do not have the capability to fuel a continuation of russian reform get to be a collective western effort and look to our ally to do more a well but beyond that really what the russian do that be go to decide the fate of reform we can simply play a role and we feel we have an obligation to do so which be consistent with our national interest q do the president say that the value of the u.s. contribution be that it would create security and prosperity for the united state so what be it about this program that do this senior administration official i think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward russia and that be we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform we be convince that if reformer stay in power then be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear force foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which be the three benefit to the united state from reform in russia so not a simple question you just say that this program be the answer a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it q and then on the question of russia 's ability to repay what convinces you be able to pay seven to 15 year from now senior administration official well the russian government have make a commitment to repay and what hop be that if reform continue and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenue that russia will be in a position six or seven year from now to pay back those loan q substantial government-to-government loan ever gotten into with the russian senior administration official i want to answer authoritatively on that i go back 20 or 30 year on this but in the last four or five year yes it be because the previous way that we finance grain export be really to just ensure private bank loan this be a different type of effort q government loan in any other sector that you recall i know it do in -- senior administration official i think fair to say this be a new and unique effort"

b"who want to look through the bar at some reactionary liberal conspiracy- theory idiot and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist support this be very typical of the elitist liberal attitude that the people be incapable of think for themselves this elitist attitude will be the eventual undo of the arrogant liberal tide sweep america a the people begin to realize more and more that they be be treat like errant child and robbed of their freedom by a bunch of utopian arrogent socialist jerk although i find myself often disagree with the populist rationale of mr. limbaugh i find him entertain and i often agree with his conclusion the fact that he sends liberal reactionary like these idiot through the roof make him all the more entertain actually i find limbaugh 's oratory less than sizzle and his debate skill sometimes lack even though his conclusion be often correct i would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hope to use concentrate political power and a load gun to force everyone to do the `` right '' thing where `` right '' be define by the elitist academic who lead the movement be show an acute case of `` myopic social perspective '' not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity limbaugh be certainly far from perfect but his opponent in the establish body politic and the medium be the one argue for federal control of virtually all aspect of the life of the citizenry and for the elimination of local control over affair public perhaps limbaugh have a follow because the people be tire of be treat like errant child by a self-important group of arrogant control myopic people who have no understand of how life operates outside of the `` oughta-be 's '' inside their own hopelessly close mind ok let u take your word for that and work with it a nice specific incident hmmm `` congress shall pas no law regard an establishment of religion nor prohibit the free exercise thereof '' liberal translation `` the federal government a long a it be run by liberal may force local school district to include certain iconic content in christmas display while prohibit others '' i think limbaugh have you on this one it seem to me that he be argue for less imposition of the federal government into religion nice job on the specificity of that one too analysis of historical/modern communication medium delete ah yes it be a conspiracy of profound proportion methinks that you may be a bit resentful of mr. limbaugh 's success because you attribute it primarily to luck how after all could anyone with profound difference of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck do you feel this same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winner or do you congratulate them on their good fortune this should be great fun since it be the liberal movement in america that be push the hardest for centralize fascist control of the people and business government/business 'partnership indeed and mr. limbaugh be the populist nemesis of that movement i have read mr. limbaugh 's book and although it be not the most literary piece i have read in recent memory it certainly do not contain `` venom '' at all let alone `` venom '' comparable to an individual who callously murder million out of racism a very serious tone in that oratory you neglect to mention that mr. limbaugh have you ever listen to his show btw continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly follow any medium icon himself include you yourself mention that he make no bone about his show be strictly about his own opinion he also adopts a rather satirical approach and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness and he say a much this be in contrast to the average mass-media show in which the audience be treat a society 's intellectual low common denominator i be sure that adolf hitler be a master of satire i be sure he be just kid when he say that the jew be the cause of germany 's problem and need to be exterminate this be not religion it be clearly a perverse worship of race since christ be a jew it seem quite unlikely that hitler 's characterization of the aryan a `` the high image of the lord '' fit with christian doctrine private religious school have a vastly well record of success than publicly fund school american history be indeed primarily judeo- christian i suppose that mr. limbaugh point out fact be equivalent to adolf hitler worship the aryan race i think you might be reach just a wee bit here definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here just a guess here but i think that mr. limbaugh would advocate government control of hollywood you should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this i believe this be more a criticism of hollywood and the deprave moral value it espouses not an advocation of government control of hollywood 90 's liberal on the other hand want to have complete government control of our school system so that the government can teach the people at an early age the `` right '' way to view religion and morality i believe mr. limbaugh be against this a his satirical use of the `` young head full of mush '' hyperbole indicates pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuate here with an implicit plea for government power to be use to break up the conspiracy indication here that `` element of the medium '' since career be a self-selected categorization perhaps an infer 'larger percentage than represent in the populace at large have a leftist bias sound too unreasonable no insinuation that cnn should not report in an objective fashion only that for reporter to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation be disingenuous to megalomaniacal you may disagree and it may well be exagerrated but it be not an unreasonable opinion and mr. limbaugh go well out of his way to make sure that his audience know that these be his opinion unlike most other reporting that purport to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other in a statistical sense reflect the bias of the reporter who be be disingenuous here mr. shaw or mr. limbaugh again you should ask mr. limbaugh himself but i expect that he would oppose government control of the medium it be indeed depress to see such myopia and tiresome liberal arrogance liberal love to play game with paradigm a a way of discredit people who disagree with them why you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engage in ludicrous comparison perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology be intellectual only in that they exist in your mind not the real world perhaps there be a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve rush limbaugh a a hate-monger but in my experience he have be spread laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the left not hatred a to mr. bush you may be correct about his fascist economic leaning mr. reagan on the other hand do his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business mr. clinton be increase fascism in america through `` business/government partnership '' and increase level of taxation perhaps you should not have skip your vocabulary class in grade school hmmm seem to me that limbaugh be not in any way comparable to hitler because he have not murder six million jew and many many others out of racism i come from a mixed-race family so i be quite well attune to racism i hear any come from rush limbaugh the only place i hear racism come from these day and be take seriously be from the liberal left the liberal left be the movement i see try to get america hooked on the opiate of socialize medicine socialize transportation socialize education etc the left already have america hopelessly addict to that liberal drug the social security chain letter it be quite clear to me that while the hitler analogy do not really apply to either rush limbaugh or william jefferson clinton if one of the two be closer than the other it be clearly the fascist clinton this be the same address a `` idiot anonymous '' it

the rise garden a oppose to 10:00 a.m. the only other thing on his schedule today be at 11:00 a.m. meet with general vessey who a you know be on his way to vietnam to continue work on the mia-pow issue at 12:30 p.m. have lunch with the vice president in the oval office and at 2:00 p.m. meet with the police organization then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. do his weekly photo with the various group q a photo op with vessey ms. myers there 's no coverage on the vessey meeting q why ms. myers why a close meeting q what about the lunch ms. myers the lunch no there 's no coverage q be he meeting with any congress people today ms. myers nothing schedule q there be no meeting -- ms. myers there be no congressional meeting today no q have the president be give any information by the pentagon or reach any conclusion about the validity of this report from hanoi any instruction to vessey on how to deal with the vietnamese on that subject ms. myers well clearly the report be the first order of business high on the agenda on something that discus i think the president and general vessey will discus the parameter of his visit to vietnam today but the president drawn any conclusion about the report yet certainly something that he want general vessey to talk with the vietnamese about first q do the president talk with any republican senator yesterday about the stimulus package ms. myers he spoke with senator dole q how many time ms. myers i believe once during the day and once last night q what be the outcome of that ms. myers continue to work toward some kind of an agreement on a job package q be it your impression that senator dole be in any way flexible on this ms. myers well i think hopeful that go to get some kind of job package through the senate and continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement q do they discus the vat tax ms. myers i know if that come up q can you check that ms. myers sure q so what be they -- be the president offering to scale down his program -- be that what try to do buy it down to where dole will sign on ms. myers well try to protect a much of it a he can but important to him to get some kind of a job package through the senate and through congress now and a soon a we reach some conclusion on that let you know but at the moment continue to consult with member of congress include obviously senator dole q be he talk to anybody else ms. myers i believe he talk to any other republican yesterday q be he talk to anybody today ms. myers i think anything be schedule but i rule it out q we be lead to believe that the president call mr. dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package be that correct ms. myers i think the president have contact several people on russian aid i think that it be always expect that the stimulus package or the job package will be part of any conversation he would have with senator dole the primary objective of the conversation be russian aid that be the first order of business but it be both q in the president 's mind be they link politically in that if the republican continue to reject the stimulus package he think it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american people have he make that argument ms. myers i talk about specifically what argument he might have make the president be obviously commit to both he like to see a job package to the american people first but a you know we outline the detail of additional russian aid last night in tokyo q but do the president believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade american to vote for russian -- to accept a vote for russian aid ms. myers i think that the president be go to continue to work to pas the stimulus package to pas a job package and still hopeful that get some kind of job package through the congress q be it fair to say that the president be negotiate now with dole ms. myers discuss option with him q on the stimulus be it your understand that over the break some democrat themselves have left the support that they have earlier for the package the stimulus package ms. myers i think we still have wide support in the senate for the job package q but specifically that lose democrat other than shelby ms. myers i believe so there be a vote q what about kohl q kohl and feingold ms. myers there be a vote yet and continue to work with senator to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of the member of the united state senate support the package q if worried about kohl and feingold why do george mention milwaukee project the other day ms. myers i think george point out a number of project in a number of state that stand to be fund or to lose funding if this job package pas q no democrat laughter ms. myers i 'll let you draw your own conclusion q do he plan to talk to dole again today or any other republican again today ms. myers there 's nothing specifically schedule but again i rule it out q do he plan to put out any more press release to any other state today ms. myers what do be in the process of break down the benefit of the job package state by state i think entirely feasible that a we sort of be able to sum those up send out press release to the various state that suggest how their state would benefit from this package q will you share those with u ms. myers sure a we do yesterday q do you have copy of the one you sent -- ms. myers yes we make those available yesterday and we certainly can continue to provide them today q dee dee since yesterday 's question and subsequent story about the vat what far consideration of this issue have be give ms. myers nothing 's change since yesterday i think the president comment on it this morning to say only that it be something he knew be be consider by the task force and that he have not make a decision on and i think we have anything to add to that q but he also say that business and labor group be tell him they support it can you tell u -- ms. myers i think that there have be -- not go to speculate on who support it i think the president say that there have be some support among business and labor group i think he say he be directly contact by them q be we to take that to mean that the administration have sound out business and labor group on this -- ms. myers i think there 's be plenty of public discourse on this over the year and even recently but i think i want to add to that q in february though the president say that this be something to be consider 10 or 15 year down the road what have happen between then and now to cause this administration to change it mind ms. myers i think a we say yesterday it be something that the work group be look at consider a wide variety of option on everything from funding to specific option that will be cover by the president 's health care plan the president have not take it up yet have not make a decision on it and beyond that i have anything to add q you answer the question it be consider by anyone in the white house after the president 's comment in february and george reaffirm that in a briefing q and then suddenly -- q what happen ms. myers the work group a we have say throughout we instruct to consider a wide variety of option across-the-board and one of the thing that have be talk about and that they be clearly consider be some kind of a value-added tax q but the president himself take this off the table dee dee and suddenly it reappears and this go to the credibility of this administration in a way what have happen in the meantime ms. myers the president have not look at this it be present to him again yet the work group be look at it a look at a wide variety of option and no decision have be make q and it raise the question of how independently the task force be work ms. myers the task force be instruct to consider all option and they 've take that mandate seriously and consider all option q but not the impression that the president left in february the impression he left be that this be something that be long-range to be look at 10 15 year down the road the clear implication of his remark be that this be something that be not on the table not an option q `` if it change i 'll tell you '' q bring him on q and you repeatedly refer to the president 's remark tell u that those be still in operation ms. myers change and we told you laughter q but what alice rivlin 's comment and donna shalala comment be about i mean that seem like an orchestrate effort because you have two independent cabinet officer -- ms. myers i -- no alice rivlin 's not a cabinet member first of all second of all it be not orchestrate but clearly they both say yesterday and in the last couple of day that something be look at we confirm that yesterday and i have anything to add to that q be it because he have very few option q be this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the president about in other word have the president himself personally rule it out and now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table or be it in fact back on the table have be place there by discussion with the president ms. myers it be not the work group 's mission at this point to convince the president of anything it be their mission to put before him his option and to explain the benefit and the cost and the basic pro and con of each of those option i think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that context and at this point not -- that presentation have not be make but something that he will hear and he have not make a decision on q they will present it to him a one of his option though he specifically rule it out ms. myers correct q dee dee be this more than a trial balloon be this a serious consideration that the work group be give to this form of taxation ms. myers simply a statement of fact the work group be consider a wide variety of option on a number of issue relate to health care reform one of the option that look at be the vat q dee dee when the work group be examine this possibility be this on the table during the same time period that you be tell u that it be not ms. myers i know what the specific timing of their draft of option be i know q who be tell you that it be not under consideration ms. myers i be refer back to the president 's comment q have they discover that the sin tax raise enough money to fund the core benefit package ms. myers no there 's no decision that have be make on how to pay for the health care plan q ask whether the projection -- ms. myers there 's a number of option depend on how the plan be structure you decide how much the plan be go to cost until you decide what the plan be go to look like and so you discus what financing option have be rule in our out until you know q dee dee be told that they have a computer model on a number of possible package ms. myers correct q the question be whether they have now determine whether sin tax would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package that be not a very difficult computation ms. myers it be a question that you know that not go to answer until -- there 's a number of option be consider it depends on how the package be structure the exact detail of the package and the financing mechanism use to pay for them be all among the decision that have yet to be make q and when the president have be meeting with health care -- his health care advisor which we be told he have be do -- ms. myers correct q they have never once say to him these be your funding option include the vat he have never heard the word vat in his -- ms. myers i be not go to comment on the specific nature of the daily -- not daily but the quasi-regular briefing q well you have ms. myers i have not other than to say that not consider the vat and i think that be a true statement q no but you say that it have not be present to him a an option ms. myers correct q that mean he heard about it ms. myers not go to get into the detail of what 's discuss i think that statement stand for itself q specific dee dee when you say he look at it do you mean that he look at it in term of pay for medical coverage or look at it in general because back in chilicothe he be very specific in define how it work what the advantage be the whole thing it sound like -- ms. myers but that be -- i think in chilicothe if you go back to his remark there it be a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure and i think the comment be generally in reference to the overall economic plan but clearly something that thought about in the broad context i mean that be clear in chilicothe what say be that in the process of the work group something that he consider yet something that the work group will present to him among the number of option and that no decision have be make and not go to comment any far on the detail of the meeting where health care issue be be discuss q your statement from this podium that no discussion of this have take place you say that no option -- that the option have not be present to him ms. myers that be correct q do you stand by -- do the white house still stand by george 's statement in march that this will not be in the proposal ms. myers no decision have be make we have nothing to add to what 's already be say q let me follow up here do you stand by what rivlin say yesterday that if any kind of vat be to be use or consider that other change to the tax code would have to be make so that it would be less regressive ms. myers not go to comment any far on what might happen if q but do you stand by the previous conversation in february that if there be to be a vat i think the president say exclude food and energy -- ms. myers not go to comment on the specific structure of a decision that be make q be the president aware prior to donna shalala 's comment yesterday that this be under consideration by the work group ms. myers i know specifically what -- q could you check for u because a real important credibility question ms. myers sure q since the task force be brought together this issue have be discuss at the begin and throughout a one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money be you all kept in the dark be the press office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when be deny that a vat tax would be consider that it be actually on the table over there a an option ms. myers i think say all that we have to say it be something the work group be look at the president have not make a decision about it yet and beyond that i have nothing to add q well sorry dee dee there be still a couple of question that we be go to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here -- yours primarily what ask be if you all be not told at all that this thing be be consider while you be come out here and tell u that it be not or if a case that you be come out here and deliberately mislead u ms. myers i believe that anyone have ever come out here and deliberately mislead you from this podium -- ever -- ever q have anyone try to shade it a little bit to indicate something -- have anybody told anybody to come out -- ms. myers not try to shade answer or deliberately mislead anybody say what i have to say about this issue q all we be try to find out -- ms. myers i understand what try to find out and give you the answer helen q try to find out what change -- what make it an option again the -- ms. myers the work group be give a broad mandate to investigate all option and they be do that q yes but it an option before how can you investigate it if the president have take it off the table ms. myers it be something that obviously consider and the president have not make a decision on q yes but he take it off the table in february ms. myers work group be consider it present it to the president at some point and make a decision q why would they consider it if he have take it off the table ms. myers clearly on the table q yes but he take it off the table do he change his mind ms. myers back on the table bill q do he change his mind ms. myers he say this morning that he make a decision about it he obviously know that on the table something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this let you know q so he must have change his mind right ms. myers at some point it will be look at i mean -- q dee dee there 's like two option -- either he change his mind or the work group think authority exceeds the president 's ms. myers the work group be give a broad mandate to look at all option they 've do that q be you go to put out his income tax ms. myers yes there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon his return will be available q will there be any kind of briefing to go through it ms. myers no nothing 's plan i think someone will be available probably not in a briefing set but to walk you through the question q use to be walk line-by-line through the presidential tax form ms. myers see those briefing laughter q could we have one ms. myers no i think there will be any kind of a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer your question about it q do they file a joint form ms. myers yes q when do he file it ms. myers i believe be file today q dee dee be there go to be a backgrounder for miyazawa ms. myers no there will be a readout after the meeting q no backgrounder today ms. myers no backgrounder today q this be complicate stuff we need help laughter ms. myers we give you tax and miyazawa all in one day too confuse laughter q vance and owen have open the door on the use of force in bosnia they 've both say that a they never rule it out and b it might be necessary now do that influence your think on whether or not to change your approach ms. myers there 's be no change in our policy towards bosnia we have always say that consider -- q but do that impact upon your decision be they people whose opinion would carry weight with you ms. myers people whose opinion carry weight certainly i mean the president support the process that they 've initiate but there 's be no change in our policy for bosnia although consider a number of option right now if the serb come back to the negotiate table if they sign on to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional option which be say regularly q one follow-up question then we can not get a straight answer from anyone in the administration why do you not set a deadline for the serb can you tell u the strategic or tactical reason for not give them a deadline to come to the table ms. myers continue to put pressure on them every day q which work so -- ms. myers well we think it be have some effect go to continue to tighten sanction a you know we support the omnibus resolution we expect that to come to a vote on the 26th q you say have an effect -- can you give u any documentation ms. myers be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanction and thing like that q there 's be no -- you have not be able to provide anybody who can tell u that the sanction have have any effect in bosnia serbia yes in bosnia no ms. myers i think that they 've have effect in serbia and we think they 've have some effect in bosnia and again i 'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the detail of that if like q we would like to hear from someone who can show u what the effect have be in bosnia we have the briefing on all of the terrible thing that be happen in belgrade but we see anything that indicates an impact on the fight can you provide something along those line ms. myers i will see what i can get you q on the extra russian aid that christopher announce this morning -- where be that money come from ms. myers have to work with congress on the detail of that package q so that would be new money that you would hope to get ms. myers yes new money in addition to the 1.6 billion announce in vancouver so i assume that you all have see the 1.8-billion package that be announce this morning in tokyo by secretary christopher q there a concern though about offering something which you have to get in congress i mean that be the concern with vancouver you want to do that ms. myers the concern with vancouver be to do something immediately which require money that be already approve in the fiscal '93 budget what look at now be a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the 1.6 billion that we announce in vancouver this clearly will require congressional approval or some of it will anyway and go to continue to work with congress to make that happen q to what extent have that be vet or agree to by congress ms. myers the president have have a number of conversation with member and will continue to work with them a this process move forward q be christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understand that you will be able to get it through congress ms. myers it be create in consultation with congress q in meeting with the law enforcement official be that -- do that have a set speech and a goal a direction ms. myers yes the president will talk about -- and the law enforcement organization be endorse the president 's job package they believe particularly the summer job package will help give kid something to do q who be they ms. myers member or leadership from three organization napo which be the national association of police organization ibpo which be the international brotherhood of police organization i believe and iupa which be the international union of police association q will the fbi chief be there ms. myers the fbi chief no q or any other federal law enforcement official ms. myers no it will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leader q do the 1.8 billion announce today include the 400 million in the fy '94 budget for disarmament ms. myers no the nunn-lugar money be separate q so this would be the 700 million in the budget already plus another 1.1 billion ms. myers i believe all of this be on top of the 700 million already in the budget q be this go to be part of the supplemental or fiscal '94 -- ms. myers work with congress on the exact funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for q this 1.8 billion on top of -- ms. myers on top of 700 million -- on top of the 400 million nunn-lugar money we announce earlier q and this be what prompt the president to call bob dole -- it be on

town hall meeting the other night the satellite and all of this relationship do the white house feel that get too close to these chamber of commerce ms. myers an interest charge laughter after how many year of democrat be accuse of not pay any attention to the chamber now there be those who would accuse u of be too close i think interest but no thrill by the support receive from the national chamber and local chamber across the country and continue to work with them on this and other initiative q what 's the status of the president think about go to this democratic retreat ms. myers on his calendar i think almost certainly go q all three day ms. myers we figure out exactly when be there yet q be it open to coverage ms. myers no i believe the whole thing be close q be he go to have

afternoon at the close of that discussion they say that they would have another talk last night which they do when the senator be up in new hampshire and although there be no specific compromise make on either side they do say that they would continue to have some discussion and where we be q well who be give in where be it stand -- be both make concession mr. stephanopoulos i know that at that phase no compromise have be make a the president have say consistently he intend to come forward with an adjust package he believe in the package but he believe that if go to take adjustment to get the minority to release it willing to make those adjustment q on the subject of a vat -- mr. stephanopoulos oh boy q can we stay on this for one more minute mr. stephanopoulos sure q we have a problem with the five minute -- q i know no decision have be make but what would lead the health group to believe that a vat might be necessary mr. stephanopoulos sorry andrea not go to go down that road no decision have be make a the president say this morning a number of group a number of member of congress a number of other organization have recommend that this be look at the work group be look at it but no decision have be make q to follow have they do that directly through him have labor and business group be in touch with the president about it mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge although there 's a lot of people who have public decision in support of the vat but the president have not make a decision q at the meeting that have with his own task force adviser have they discuss the funding issue and what the possible option would be mr. stephanopoulos i think that that have be present for a decision no q not for a decision but have it be discuss a an option mr. stephanopoulos again there be a lot of level of briefing i do not believe that the vat have be present to the president a okay this be something for you to decide on q not say he know it be be consider though be you mr. stephanopoulos no he say be consider q he knew that q but have he discuss that with his adviser what ask mr. stephanopoulos the president have say be consider i do not know what level of discussion there have be over the vat it be something the work group be look at i even know that -- q but he say he be consider do he at this stage mr. stephanopoulos no he be not i think get into something of a metaphysical debate right here what be consider -- q well he be the one who say i review it mr. stephanopoulos that be true that be what i just repeat q george be there any concern here that a a result of the definite statement he make in february and the promise that if it be to be consider let u know and have it trickle out the way it do that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others mr. stephanopoulos i think so i mean it be now public knowledge that this be be consider q be he or you at all embarrass about the absolute statement that be make from this platform to the effect that it be off the table and be not be consider and then to have it come out not from you people but -- mr. stephanopoulos well wait a second it come out from the administration what be you talk about q what say be though that the president say he would let u know mr. stephanopoulos right q you people then say -- you say i believe that not go to be on the program mr. stephanopoulos on march 25th q on march 25th mr. stephanopoulos circumstance change q well i understand but we have to find that out by root around in the fine print of an interview mr. stephanopoulos root around -- i know you do do a very good job there to read the usa today article but this be -- laughter -- the deputy director of the omb and the secretary of health and human service i mean that be common anytime you guy write a story that have an unattributed quote from somebody in the clinton administration the headline be -- i 'll look at it right here and ap story -- `` clinton want more money for spy '' q what about his remark that if it be be consider tell u about it mr. stephanopoulos and the administration 's concerned and let you know q and do he mr. stephanopoulos yes absolutely what do he say this morning q it have to be drag out of you here yesterday mr. stephanopoulos it have to be drag out of me we have the deputy director of the omb we have the secretary of health of human service say it be be consider that be his administration that be his administration policy q be these authorize trial balloon or be they orchestrate leak i mean what be the -- mr. stephanopoulos they be ask question they answer the question q say here that it have to be drag out that you more or less make it clear yesterday you be consider it mr. stephanopoulos absolutely i be very clear painfully clear q be there a particular political strategy in make it clear the administration be consider a new tax increase on tax day mr. stephanopoulos no it be just this issue be be consider they be ask if it be be consider they answer that it be be consider q george the new york time -- q why do it yesterday mr. stephanopoulos they be ask q the new york time report today that secretary reich and the chief economist at the labor department use apple and orange number in order to portray last month 's unemployment figure in a way that be supportive of the president 's job stimulus bill but which turn out to be totally false mr. stephanopoulos i know if it be totally false but i think -- laughter -- the chief economist at the labor department do grant that it be an inappropriate mix and they say that q the question be be the president concerned about behavior that amount to corrupt government data and what 's he do about it if so mr. stephanopoulos the chief economist have say that a mistake be make it happen again and the end of the matter q that the same information that go to the president q if i could go back to the stimulus package -- mr. stephanopoulos there 's two separate piece of information i think where the confusion be q when do you all first learn about this mistake that be make mr. stephanopoulos i read the article this morning q and a far a you know be the president aware of it mr. stephanopoulos i think so q and be he aware of it before he read about it in the new york time mr. stephanopoulos i know not to my knowledge q do you ever hear about it before this morning anything mr. stephanopoulos i q the president give an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose for his speech for his argument mr. stephanopoulos well again not sure both statement be true what the labor department have grant be that mix them in one sentence essentially be mislead they say it be a mistake they say they do it again q do they drop it -- be this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of mr. stephanopoulos whenever few people be out of work gratify but that take away from the need to get this job package go q if i could go back to the stimulus package for a minute you say that the president plan to come forward with an amendment be the timetable still what it be -- that the amendment would be laid down on monday and vote on on tuesday or do he in the conversation with dole talk about the possibility of put that off for a few more day to give more time for the discussion mr. stephanopoulos i think at this point there 's no change in the schedule at all i know that they discuss the timing like that q do you believe that closer or get closer this week than you be last week mr. stephanopoulos again i believe that go to pas a job package the president be prepared to make adjustment in order to get that to happen i know where the vote be on cloture at this particular time i know what 's go to happen until we have a vote but the president believe deeply in this job package and want to get it do q have there be any indication that this situation have change mr. stephanopoulos go to continue to work on it know when the vote be take q george last week you say that there be -- or various people in the administration be say that you go through dole you be go to have to try and go around him because he be immovable on this subject of a compromise or at least the compromise he want be not anything like the one that you could accept this week talk to him be that because realize that the peel off effort go to work mr. stephanopoulos because senator dole want to talk to the president about the stimulus package q he initiate the conversation mr. stephanopoulos yes q secretary reich this morning say that in fact the president be not willing to compromise on this bill at all you say make -- mr. stephanopoulos i know that exactly what he say i think he say he have any indication that there be any compromise yet or that there would be a compromise and the president want to compromise and the president want to compromise but if he have to make adjustment to get it through he will q official here yesterday say that panetta be work on a series of adjustment that might be make public before the actual vote mr. stephanopoulos possible q today mr. stephanopoulos not sure exactly when that will happen but i think that very possible that come forward with some sort of a different package or senate democrat will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it pass q a we understood his conversation with dole the first one be some discussion of this and i 'll get back to you tonight with some detail or some adjustment or whatever the phrase be do he offer him some detail or some adjustment mr. stephanopoulos i think a question of how detailed i mean i think they have a general discussion about the package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon i believe that there will be follow-up discussion today in the senate not necessarily between the president and senator dole and let me just reiterate neither side have make specific compromise at this date when we have something let you know and not suggest that senator dole have accepted anything that talk about or that offer anything in a hard way q what be the follow-up discussion if not the president and dole mr. stephanopoulos i think senator mitchell be go to talk to senator dole q be that a threat laughter q do the president say to senator dole all right how about this number a an overall size or do dole say to the president i can go a high a this do they talk number mr. stephanopoulos i think it be a negotiation in that respect it be more of a discussion about their position q do they discus actual number mr. stephanopoulos just not sure i know they talk about the basic outline of the package i think they talk about the program they care about i know if they get to the level of this many x-billion dollar q do dole have to sign off before there be a package mr. stephanopoulos no of course not q do the white house have anything to do with the protester who show up in new hampshire today where senator dole be speak be that in any way organize by -- mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge no q and have the president be in touch with senator kohl or feingold mr. stephanopoulos i think talk to them no q george be the president consider the more palatable fact of have a national sale tax instead of have the have have to continuously pay for the have-not and be he go to scrap his propose tax on the privileged few with the have have to pay for the have-not mr. stephanopoulos the president believe deeply that the tax rate on upper income american a he present in his budget should go up and i think for the second half of your question i 'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday q george on the subject of accuracy in information you suggest the other day that the stimulus package include money that would solve the water problem in milwaukee apparently that be not true actually waste water money mr. stephanopoulos waste water money for wisconsin and some could go to milwaukee q but it would not affect the drinking water problem because waste water money right mr. stephanopoulos it would affect the water treatment overall q but the implication from your statement the other day be that it would help fix this disease problem in milwaukee now would you agree not the case mr. stephanopoulos not sure of the specific i know that it go to the overall water treatment in wisconsin q a leftover question from this morning which be when do the president find out that the task force be deliberate on a vat mr. stephanopoulos not sure exactly when i just know i assume it come up over the last -- certainly between the time that we have comment on in the past and two day ago q so sometime since march 25th mr. stephanopoulos i think right i know the exact date q george the president this morning mention that some labor and business group be for the vat tax apparently the national association of manufacturer talk about perhaps the vat tax be okay if it replaces the btu tax so do the president feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax propose or be this totally in addition to the other tax already propose mr. stephanopoulos i think say all we have to say about the vat at this point i mean there 's just no -- this be be consider by the health care work group and that be all the president make any far decision beyond that q but it would be to finance health care it be to replace some other tax that finance -- it replace the income tax for instance mr. stephanopoulos there have be no discussion on that q in term of get a vat tax through congress senator dole 's press release today say vat -- on tax day do you think -- do it have a chance of get through congress would it have a chance mr. stephanopoulos i have no idea q be that a consideration whether you all put it forward mr. stephanopoulos that would become a consideration if the president be to decide to do it not in consideration now q you say at the begin of the briefing that circumstance have change and that have cause the vat to now be under consideration mr. stephanopoulos yes what the president refer to this morning these group come forward and say this be something that have to be consider q those be the circumstance that have change the only difference between now and when he emphatically rule it out that group have ask it to be consider mr. stephanopoulos what he say q be that true mr. stephanopoulos yes q be there in fact some understand that sin tax would not produce enough money for the health care benefit mr. stephanopoulos not go to get into the deliberation q but george -- mr. stephanopoulos no what the consideration be a the president say group come forward and say this be something you ought to consider the work group be look at it q be that the only thing change since his prior statement and your prior statement on the vat mr. stephanopoulos yes q can you explain how those group -- how that information get to him that group want it be it just reading the newspaper or do group make presentation mr. stephanopoulos i think the group -- a you know the health care task force have met with dozen of group q but this be the president 's knowledge that these group have come forward mr. stephanopoulos i think he be refer to what be come to the work group obviously there have also be publish position in the newspaper q have certain group briefed him on the group 's presentation to them mr. stephanopoulos i know if they 've briefed him -- i mean how detailed the briefing have be i know that the work group decide to look into this after be press by these group q what kind of argument do the group make that be persuasive enough that the president would change the position that he have enunciate previously mr. stephanopoulos i know just they 've have longstanding position that this would be a good way to finance health care q the president aware of those longstanding position mr. stephanopoulos he may have be at some level obviously be a governor for a long time and he know the basic argument for and against a vat tax q what try to figure out here -- tell u that the only change the only thing that affected this change in the president 's attitude toward the vat between february and now -- mr. stephanopoulos the president 's attitude necessarily change i mean he have not make a decision q i know but the president say that it be off the table so do you and say that the only thing change be the position of these group except also describe them a longstanding position i see the change if these group have any change in their position be make to the president -- mr. stephanopoulos well they 've make the presentation to the health care task force q there 's no relationship at all between the fact that sin tax that he have say -- suggest in february that he favor will not produce enough revenue to finance -- mr. stephanopoulos i think he ever suggest that they would produce all the revenue q well he suggest that he thought that those be appropriate way to finance health care mr. stephanopoulos he do say that i know that he say anything to refute that q but in fact have the task force discover that there be enough revenue from those tax to finance the kind of core benefit -- mr. stephanopoulos again i think that the task force ever suggest that there would q george if he advocate a vat tax would that break his promise not to raise tax on the middle class to pay for his program mr. stephanopoulos i comment on a hypothetical situation q but do that promise -- would that promise not to raise tax on the middle class to pay for the program prevent him from seek a vat tax mr. stephanopoulos the president have make no decision on the vat tax when he do tell you and explain the implication then q which specific group can you cite -- business labor or otherwise -- whose recommendation to the health care task force have prompt this consideration mr. stephanopoulos i have the specific i just have that q george can you tell u to what extend these other alternative for instance the employer tax or the sin tax or other financing option be also still on the table and what these option be mr. stephanopoulos no a member of the task force and representative of the work group have say they be look at a wide variety of option i think that ira magaziner say that there be 20 different option under consideration but not go to comment -- q what 's the scope -- mr. stephanopoulos just not go to comment on them no q what 's the scope of the need how much be you talk about that have to be produce by one or a combination of the -- mr. stephanopoulos what the health care task force be look at q since there 's not go to be any briefing on the miyazawa visit two question one generally what do the president hope to use that meeting for but more specifically be his task complicate by the japanese anger over the vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference mr. stephanopoulos the vancouver note q do no mean yes q yes and no mr. stephanopoulos well i know i saw the prime minister 's press conference where he be ask the question about that note and he give a very gracious and complete answer when he be ask the question the question of trade be something that certainly will be discuss between the prime minister and the president there be obviously a trade imbalance between japan and the u.s. that we want to do something about q also in those comment the prime minister make he suggest that the united state should come down heavy on him in term of trade be you go to oblige mr. stephanopoulos i think the president will state our view on trade very clearly and our view on the trade deficit very clearly i necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the prime minister 's comment q that we need specific export target specific numerical target -- be that what go to discus with miyazawa mr. stephanopoulos go to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issue i want to get into those specific until after the meeting q why q the crux of the issue right whether or not -- do the president believe that without specific numerical target it be really a he say in his press conference sort of hopeless that this be go to change very much mr. stephanopoulos the president believe that we must have pressure on japan to turn the trade imbalance around i do not want to get into the specific of how that would be do q but do the president believe that their stimulus package announce yesterday will rectify the imbalance mr. stephanopoulos i think first the president want to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from prime minister miyazawa himself and then make the comment on it q how about the russian aid package there seem to be some confusion about how the u.s. view that secretary christopher say -- or bentsen say the japanese may need to do more the japanese say that not what they heard mr. stephanopoulos again go to continue to work with all our ally in the g-7 and go to continue to press for help for russian reform russian democratic reform and i think that so far we have a very good announcement out of tokyo and go to continue to work with our ally for bilateral package q do you think the japanese need to do more mr. stephanopoulos go to continue to work with all our ally to do a much a we can q secretary christopher be ask today on the today show this morning what he thought of margaret thatcher 's comment on the bosnia policy and he say `` a rather emotional response '' mr. stephanopoulos over an emotional issue q right -- to an emotional problem do the white house condone that kind of remark mr. stephanopoulos i think that secretary christopher 's remark speaks for itself the president believe also that this be a deeply trouble situation that try to find answer for q but that specific -- `` rather emotional response '' -- specific term mr. stephanopoulos no it speaks for itself q in connection with that it seem that with the number of people who be be kill at this very moment be it good american policy to put off some decision that might be make now to help boris yeltsin win a referendum mr. stephanopoulos for example q to take strong action to take military action -- air strike anything that can be do mr. stephanopoulos the president believe that what must be do now be to push harder for sanction he be also -- a you know the administration have be discuss lift the arm embargo he believe those be the appropriate way to increase pressure at this time q what be your response to the critic who would say that the u.s. be now stymie by try to help boris yeltsin retain the presidency mr. stephanopoulos wrong press hard for the serb to come to the negotiate table press hard for increase sanction and talk to our ally about the arm embargo q you be put great store in vance and owen get people to agree to that now vance and owen have both say that military force to some extent would be acceptable do that change your think mr. stephanopoulos clearly go to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say but at this point the president be move forward on sanction and talk about the arm embargo q a follow-up on a dee dee comment this morning she say she would be able to provide some administration official who could document the effect the sanction be have in bosnia be you go to be able to do that or do you have anything -- mr. stephanopoulos i think what she say q exactly what she say mr. stephanopoulos i think true but what she say -- we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provide in bosnia obviously if there be connection between the bosnian serb and the serb in belgrade and we be tighten the screw on the serb in belgrade that will have an effect over time i do not know day by day minute by minute what kind of help be be give between the two and what the exact effect have be but clearly we be slow the shipment of good into belgrade we be have an effect on the serb there what kind of effect that will eventually have on the bosnian serb i know but one thing i would say be if it be have no effect at all i know why be fight it so much q be the first lady 's tax return go to be release mr. stephanopoulos i think there 's a joint tax return and it will be probably later today q be the president consider signing an executive order ban discrimination against homosexual in the federal work force a part of the gay right march here next week mr. stephanopoulos i think there 's any proposal for that at this time not

investigation -- and access to military archive and ambassador toon also briefed the president on the activity of the joint commission and on the document q vietnam say a fake what be the dod analysis at this stage mr. stephanopoulos not complete yet and also the first thing that general vessey will bring up with the vietnamese q a number of defense official have be say that they think that the 600

wait for the complete review when we have it make a judgment q i know you have any final determination but give all of the intense public interest in this do you think that a likely possibility mr.

the president have have restrict access to the press i would point out that answer 358 question on 77 occasion more than any of his predecessor i would also point out it also -- q how many question mr. stephanopoulos three hundred fifty-eight on 77 occasion q how many be while he be jogging mr. stephanopoulos well no actually a very good question andrea and i would point out far that the article also imply that these question be only answer at tightly control photo opportunity which be just patently false have 13 press conference in either the east room the oval office or the roosevelt room or the briefing room in addition to question take at photo opportunity and that be only the -- q oval office press conference -- when be that mr. stephanopoulos answer question in the -- east room

b"the white house office of the press secretary vancouver british columbia _________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 4 1993 press conference by the president with russian press canada place vancouver british columbia 2:46 p.m. pdt q i have two question for both president so you could probably answer for boris too laughter the president i 'll give you my answer then i 'll give you yeltsin 's answer laughter q the first be that this be the meeting of the president so the money be promise be government money and naturally go to be distribute through the government but indicate that three-quarters be go to be go to business so the question be how the russian business themselves be go to be consult if ever what be the priority because there be several association of russian businessmen exist already so will they be invite to participate in set up priority for investment this be the first and second to you we know that poll public poll in america do not show that american be very enthusiastic about give this aid like newsweek poll say that about 75 percent approve it and new york time publish that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war 42 percent if it foster democratic reform and only 29 percent if it just personally support yeltsin how be you go to sort of handle this problem that american themselves be not very enthusiastic thank you q i have a question sorry -- be there go to be a translation of everything into russian no just the answer just the answer okay the president the answer to the first question be it depends on what kind of aid discuss for example the fund that will be set up for financing new business will obviously go to those business who apply and who seem to be good risk and make the application the privatization fund will be use to support the privatization of exist public enterprise then there be some other general fund in the democracy corp and other thing which people in russia will have some influence over the distribution of with regard to your second question let me say that i would think that there would be people in both country who would not feel too warmly toward simply the american government give money to the russian government there 's opposition to that in russia and in our country throughout our whole history there have be an opposition to foreign aid of all kind that be this have nothing to do with russia if you look at the whole history of america any kind of aid program have always be unpopular what i have try to tell the american people be be this be not an aid program this be an investment program that this be an investment in our future we spent 4 trillion -- trillion -- on armament on soldier and other investment because of the cold war now with a democratic government in russia with the newly independent state the remainder of them work on a democracy and struggle to get their economy go it seem to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive for the economy of russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there and for u to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapon and other element of hostility on both side on our side and on the russian side so i see this a an aid program this be an investment for the united state this be very much in the interest of the united state the thing i announce today the second stage of the program which i hope to put together next week in my view be thing that be good for my country and for the taxpayer and worker of my country russia be a very great nation that need some partnership now some common endeavor with other people who share her goal but it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this a some sort of just a charity or an aid issue not what it be an investment for america and a wonderful investment like all investment there be some risk but there 's far less risk with a far great potential of return than the 4 trillion we spent look at each other across the barrier of the cold war q mr. president first of all thank you very much indeed for come here and talk to u in the memory of the living correspondent this be the first time an american president be do this to the russian press corp so kind of a very measure breakthrough i have two question one in your introductory remark of the other press conference you mention in brief that you discuss the start ii and start i issue could you tell u do you reach an agreement with president yeltsin a to what might be do in order to have ukraine join the ratification of start i and the npt regime and my second question be how confident you be that the united state congress would be eager to support you in lift jackson-vanik and other restriction inherit from the cold war president clinton first we discuss the issue of ukraine with regard to start i and npt and generally with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent state all be non-nuclear but also to have the united state develop strong relationship with them we know that one thing that we could do that would increase i think the willingness of the ukraine to support this direction be to successfully conclude our own negotiation on highly enrich uranium because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for russia but also for ukraine and it would show some reach out on our part but we agree that basically the people who sign off on the lisbon protocol have get to honor what they do and we agree to continue to press that i myself have spent a good deal of time try to reassure ukraine 's leader specifically the president and the foreign minister that i want strong tie with ukraine that the united state very much want a good relationship with ukraine but that in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of ukraine and to have the united state be fully supportive the commitment to ratify start i and to join the npt regime be critical what be the second question the president with regard to jackson-vanik and cocom i would make two point first i have agree with the republican and democratic leader in the congress that we will a soon a i return have a list of all the legislative and other restriction some of them be regulatory in nature impose on relation between the united state and russia that be legacy of the cold war and we will see whether -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now at least among the leadership of the congress with regard to jackson-vanik i think there will be an openness to change the law if the congress be convince there be in fact no more refusniks no more people who wish to emigrate who be not be allow to if the fact be that there be no one there who would have be -- who the law be design to affect then i think that the desire to keep the law will be much less with regard to cocom my guess be and nothing more than a guess that the leadership of congress and indeed my own adviser might prefer to see some sort of phase movement out of the cocom regime but i think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future q mr. clinton when i read your speech in annapolis i get the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and i stress that -- personal not political approach towards russia compare to the approach of mr. bush could you formulate in a few word what be the difference between you a a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to russia and the approach of mr. bush and who make you -- why do you cite akhmatova in the last part of your speech the president let me say first i do not wish to compare myself with president bush or anyone else i say what be in his heart about russia i can say that since i be a boy i have be personally fascinate with the history the music and the culture and the literature of russia i have be thrill by russian music since i be a serious student of music for more than 30 year now i have read major russian novelist and many of your poet and follow your ballet and try to know a much a i could about your history and i go to the soviet union -- but it be then the soviet union -- you may know it be a big issue in the last presidential campaign that i spent the first week of 1970 alone in moscow and do not return again until three day before mr. yeltsin be elect president but all that time i be away i be follow event there very closely and hop for the day when we could be genuine partner so i have always have a personal feel about russia i remember for example -- a lot of you know i like music very much one of the most move experience for me a a musician be when leonard bernstein take the new york philharmonic to moscow and played shostakovich 's fifth symphony to the russian and he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone have ever played it before because it be technically so difficult that be something i follow very closely when it occur these be thing that have always have a big impact on my life and i have just always hop that someday if i ever have the chance to i could play a role in see our two country become closer partner applause the press thank you"

b"the argument that `` slavery be a die institution '' be often make by ^^^ be historian mainly southerner who sought to divert attention from the institution a the central issue of the civil war in fact however the argument be specious at best more recent scholarship from the last 20-30 year demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton/sugar/ tobacco economy and it reliance on slavery be increasingly dominant in the south prior to the civil war this be because the south do not receive the massive momentum of capital intensive growth that the northern state do compare the northern agricultural system with the southern and you will see a major difference in the capital to labor intensity capital and labor be one and the same in a slave economy except that capital reproduce quite a readily a slave do slavery be a die institution before the cotton gin yes but not in 1850 it be true that cotton suffer from price depression in the 1840 's the period use to claim that slavery would not have last in the south that be not the argument that i have heard it would not have last because the growth in the north would not have be sustain for much longer without spill over to the southern state i.e northern industry would have migrate capital to the southern state and with that would have come immigrant labor to the port of the south e.g charleston savannah mobile new orleans etc this would have put the break on the slave market and slavery would have be out-moded by the capital intensity of compete agriculturalist those that insist on keep slave because of their `` cruel heart and hatred for black people '' would have be driven out of business simple capital to labor ratio ... read michael parkin _microeconomics_ 2nd edition and any other basic economics book this assumes that the slave holder dominance over state government would not have cause the passage of law to keep out capital from the north since slave holder be prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free market in order to maintain slavery i do not doubt that they would have pass law to cripple any serious competitive threat thomas sowell 's _market and minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery and the cost it impose on state and local government discourage not only capital formation but also outside capital investment in the southern state craig a. depken ii"

president good to have you we thank you for take the time to visit with these community here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this even also we have with u secretary of labor robert

at this time great to have you the president thank you very much mr. secretary glad to be here with my friend dick riley and bob reich -- also member of my cabinet -- at the headquarters of the chamber of commerce to support the effort that the chamber be make along with it center for work force preparation to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place i want to compliment the chamber on all their effort recognize that without an educate work force we grow this economy or remain competitive and recognize that we all have to work together -- business and government labor and educator -- to make thing happen this satellite town meeting be a good example of that kind of work together and if forgive me a little home state pride i want to say a special word of thanks to the wal-mart corporation headquarter in bentonville arkansas for provide several hundred of the site for this town meeting tonight i appreciate that a lot a well a the site that be provide for all the rest of you i have try a hard a i could to move toward constructive change for this country secretary riley talk about this be thomas jefferson 's 250th birthday if thomas jefferson believe in anything he believe in these three thing first in education second in real personal liberty freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of the press and third in the absolute imperative of change a time change if you go to the jefferson memorial here in this beautiful city which be now bedeck with all of it wonderful cherry blossom you will see jefferson say that we have to change with change time for u here in america that mean reduce our deficit and increase our investment and put our people first so that we can compete in the world here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people well unless we do that none of the effort that all the rest of u make in government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase our investment in other thing which will grow job will last in the long run we also have to have people who can carry their load and in a world where the average young person will change job seven or eight time in a lifetime that begin with the education system and continue into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime not just important what you know but what you can learn and if i might like to close just by emphasize do our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the labor department and the education department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition and try to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer job include many thousand that have a strong education component so our young people can be learn and work at the same time dick i think i ought to stop there a good place we can begin i think the discussion secretary riley thank you so much mr. president each month we get together and talk about way that all citizen can work towards reach the national education goal and tonight focus on goal five and how community such a yours can prepare student for this world of work this week the education department and the labor department be host a conference here in washington d.c. call summer challenge a program of work and learn to america 's youth the aim be to use some special fund from president clinton 's propose economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched job and summer school program for young people in disadvantage area of the country mr. president let 's talk a minute -- you allude to it somewhat -- about the summer youth challenge your program call for more educational enrichment in the summer job and why in your word be that so important the president i think important for two reason first of all a lot of the young people try to reach may have have trouble adjust to school and learn and while we want them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kid that have trouble learn in school may forget a much a 30 percent of what they learn the previous year over the summertime and that be a very unproductive thing for school to have to take up a lot of time teach what they already taught before secondly we want to help these young people progress not only in term of work but in term of learn we want to abolish the artificial divide line between what be work and what be learn because we think that the best and most productive worker will have to be lifetime learner and we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school or at work or in college a they go on secretary riley well i think the fact that these be disadvantage kid -- that gap that lag you mention a they go into the next year be really even great secretary reich of course you have training program throughout the year and i wonder be you have any comment about this educational component of training secretary reich well what learn mr. secretary be that for many young people whether for the summer or for the year actually on-the-job work experience combine with education be one of the best way of learn many young people for example have a lot -- they have a difficult time learn geometry but when they actually be there building something or work on something and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry they understand what use for and a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work be terribly terribly important important during the summer but important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer secretary riley thank you mr. president call for a youth apprenticeship program school-to-work transition and i wonder if you would tell u a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it develop the president well first of all let 's talk about why important most new job that will be create in this decade will not require a four-year college degree but most of them will require some learn and skill that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma if you look at the last 10 year the average salary of young people that have at least two year of good post-high school education be a good salary that go up over the decade the young people who have less than that tend to have low wage that do not go up and in many case in real term fell over the decade because they productive they more valuable to their employer so we think america have a big economic interest in try to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but go on to college make a transition to work which include two year of far training either in a community college a vocational set or perhaps on the job and what i have do in this budget a you know be to give you and secretary reich some fund and some incentive to try to work in partnership with state and with the private sector to build these program state-by-state in a way that would be customize essentially by the business community base on the need of the economy in any give area it could revolutionize long-term the quality of the american work force and the earnings of american worker secretary reich i should add mr. president -- i think you know this from your experience in arkansas -- and many of the people watch this program -- that the business community and educator labor group be already in many of our community many of our state building a school-to-work transition program in fact there 's an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement the people watch this program probably be the one who be most directly involve in that and more power to them secretary riley and i be go to do everything we can to build on the success already out there secretary riley bob go to be talk tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co-op learn career academy and what feature all those program that deal with this subject -- what be some of the feature that every one of these school-to-work program might have that be important secretary reich well one thing that see -- and you and i have be work at this for a long time and you much longer than i -- see that active involvement of the business community be absolutely essential and so delighted that do this in the headquarters of the chamber of commerce the chamber of commerce of the united state be commit to do these kind of program -- training education retrain -- and aim to work very closely with the chamber the business community be go to be actively engage in develop almost an audit of the kind of job that be need and help the educator community college technical institution develop curriculum that be relevant for the job of the future community have get to come together i mean this be one of the most important thing get to have all of these player in a community come together and work together and cooperate together you know too often we have the educator over here and the business leader over here labor group over here and everybody be talk but not really work together in a common strategy and the third and final ingredient i would say dick would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skill development excellence this be not a track program talk about for kid who be not go to make it this be a program that every young person ought to be eligible for if they want to go on beyond that to four-year college fine that ought to be permissible but talk about the foundation of learn about job the foundation skill for on-the-job learn and again those be the critical component already be do the president i think -- if i might just interject one point base on my personal experience at home -- the business community have a critical role to play not simply in say here be the job skill that be need and here 's what ought to be taught but also in monitoring that excellence if you have the right sort of partnership there the people who be pay the tax and who be go to then be hire the worker be not go to permit the second-rate program to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them so i think very important and when we try to if you will fill in the blank at the federal level try to set some standard and provide some fund one of the thing that we want to be sure and do be to make sure that the employer have a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these program because really what 's go to determine whether the whole thing be worthwhile secretary riley great be talk of course about school-to-work and also the job and economic recovery program for this summer and fall but let 's talk just a moment about long-term school reform something especially close to me mr. president i wonder if you would give u some of your idea for the community out here on goal 2000 legislation that i think will be come forth before too long the president well a you know back when you and i be both governor we spent a lot of time work on our public school and we try to be very candid with our people in say that a lot of these thing be go to take some time to materialize i have a hand in write the national education goal that the governor draft along with representative of president bush 's administration back in 1989. and what go to try to do this year with your leadership be to introduce legislation in congress that will actually define the thing that the national government ought to do to try to help the local school and the child of this country and the adult learner too meet those goal -- make sure that when -- by 2000 people show up for school ready to learn that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate that child at the 4th 8th and 12th grade be confident in the subject suppose to know that they be second to none in math and science that be school be safe discipline and drug-free and of course the fifth goal -- i take them out of line to say this the last -- be that we have a system of life-long learn in this country and each one of those goal there 's a national role a state role a school role school district role and a private sector role and what attempt to do in this bill go to introduce with me in the next few week be to define what our job be and then to give the rest of america a way of define what their job be and see whether actually meeting the standard of quality that we need to meet very excite so far a i know nothing quite like it have ever be do in the form of federal legislation before not mandate and tell people what they have to do with their money but actually set up a framework for excellence and partnership so that we can do our job really excite about it secretary riley well i be too and i think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in term of it relationship with state serve a a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform effort all driven by high standard the point bob let me ask you one question and then get to the telephone call about the same subject we have of course skill standard that be go to be part of goal 2000 and i wonder if you would comment on that secretary reich well you know we have 75 percent of our young people who graduate from college very often they have very many alternative they do have a wonderful system of community college and technical institution but if we have national skill standard to which they could aspire and which employer would understand a a national credential many of these young people would actually find that they be much more eligible for job everybody have to go to college other country you have small proportion of their population go to college but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical preprofessional skill we can do it in this country if you go to four-year college not a loser and we want to develop those national skill standard go to be work with the state with the education department with a lot of private industry in develop those standard and i think they will be the kind of thing that enable our vocational and technical and other institution to rally around a well a our business community secretary riley well great why we go ahead and go to the telephone we have a call i see -- mayor bruce todd of austin texas q yes mr. president and mr. secretary reich and riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today we have some dedicate professional and volunteer here in austin who have heard what you have say and be very appreciative let me simply say amen to some of the comment make already we agree with much of the tone that the clinton administration have take and be very supportive we have be successful here in austin of triple our summer employment program over the last four year we expect to have over 2,000 employ this year in the summertime perhaps a much a 3,500 with the federal assistance much of the question that we have design you have answer in your opening comment so we must be think alike but the question essentially involve what initiative after labor day would be appropriate we know summertime be important year-round be even more important and what kind of initiative at the federal level might be propose to meet the need of the youth on a year- round basis and perhaps more importantly how can family and the local community be more involve use the federal initiative something that we believe be very important to success in this effort secretary riley mr. president the president i think i 'll give everybody a chance to answer the question bruce but let me first thank you for call and thank you for all the great work that do in austin see some of it and always be very impressed first with regard to the summer program we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable u to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into school under circumstance that might allow them to do some work in the private sector too we hope that -- secretary reich be go to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector job to be match with the public sector job this summer and work on that secondly in the program that i have present to the congress over the next five year what we be attempt to do be to build in an amount of investment quite substantial for job training program for school-to-work program all of which give heavy heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you ask -- but do provide some federal investment dollar which we hope you can put with local dollar to keep people work and be train on a year-round basis and i will say again to echo what secretary reich say a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what be see a work and what be see a learn an awful lot of young people actually have quite high iq but actually learn so much well when do than when reading or just listen so we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and we hope that if the whole budget pass -- and we do have 200 budget cut and more than 200 actually in the budget -- and some revenue raiser and some new money for education and training that be able to do just what you seem to want base on your question bob do you want to say anything secretary reich well you take most of the word out of my mouth mr. president a usual but let me just add one thing and that be that one of the most important aspect of post-high school for a lot of young people who be not go on to college in addition to the school-to-work program simply be the availability of job and get to get this economy move again obviously terribly important to get this recovery program to get the economy back on track sort of the prerequisite to everything else if we get the economy back on track -- we have -- i think this be the 16th -- correct me if wrong mr. president -- i think be the 16th month we have have seven percent unemployment or great this be a jobless recovery a lot of those kid be go to be get out of school in june and even if we do everything right they would have a very very hard time get job secretary riley thank you both of course goal 2000 will be a permanent long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year it will involve if pass -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plan with every state where we can be work together to reach for the goal in a number of different way and then the state with all the various school district a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement and i think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that move the next call be dr. harry heinemann new york doctor q good even mr. secretary it be a pleasure to be on with you this even a you may know bridging the school and work have be central to la guardia 's educational program since it inception in the 1970s and that include the college the two alternative high school that operate on our campus and the linkage we have forge with the local school we have found this to be an extremely effective learn strategy and over the year come to believe that there be several principle that be very important in bridging the school and work and these include integrate theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace with provide all student early exposure to career a well a provide opportunity for them to reflect upon these experience while they strengthen their skill and lastly the critical role of the liberal art particularly in the development of high performance competency my question then be how can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrate with transition to work experience and what mechanism and strategy can you suggest to achieve this integration secretary riley well thank you very much i think -- and get a response from you all on that and very interest work go on there go to have three people our next guest on the program this even that will be some specialist in that area that speak and i 'll certainly pas that on to them and we can discus it later you all care to comment -- any comment you might have the president just like to say if i might one thing i want to reemphasize this and i think be a clear about it a like although i think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than i. i think this whole concept of apply academic be very important and i think that we have to basically abolish what i consider to be a very artificial distinction between what be vocational learn and what be academic learn i think we should keep the liberal art go i think we should have a strong component for people who be in the vocational program secretary reich it seem to me that we also need to rethink our entire track system because a lot of these school and work combination be important for mainstream student important for all student not just a special group of student that need them some of the experiment that see around the united state -- dick sure see them a well -- be mainstream experiment mainstreaming all the student at 11th and 12th grade give them a combine work and school experience and then a transition program and again the kid can either go on to college if they want they can go on to technical community they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibility and career direction but we have to get away from the stigmatize that often go on with young people who simply be do job-related or work- related work within the classroom within our school secretary riley thank you very much i think go to be the last call that we have time for mr. president i think get to move on to another matter and i want to thank you and secretary reich for be here we appreciate your time and your idea and be a tremendous help to u"

b"the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 14 1993 press briefing by george stephanopoulos the briefing room 12:40 p.m. edt mr. stephanopoulos i guess just prepared to take question today q george bob dole say that the clinton administration 's policy on bosnia be a failure and that he want the united state to take the lead in lift the arm embargo so that the bosnian muslim can defend themselves mr. stephanopoulos a you know president clinton have say that that suggestion be under active consideration obviously this be a tragic situation in bosnia and if the bosnian serb come to the negotiate table in a constructive way look seriously at press for lift the arm embargo in the meantime go to continue to press for a tough sanction resolution in the u.n. go to continue to work on the serb to come to the negotiate table but the prospect of an arm embargo be something the president certainly will consider if the serb come to the table q how much longer be you go to give them to come to the table george mr. stephanopoulos work on that right now q be a long time q on february 19th the president mention the value add tax in ohio and when he be ask about it later by reporter he say -- quote -- `` that be a radical change in the tax system of the united state something i think we may have to look at in the year ahead '' question again about it later he say `` it be not something that be now under consideration if we start consider it i 'll tell you '' it a trial balloon or anything he say i be just discuss the tax response to a question donna shalala quote in usa today this morning -- quote `` certainly look at a vat '' what 's go on q the same with alice rivlin this morning mr. stephanopoulos the health care task force be review a number of option they make any decision yet and a i have say from this podium time and time again not go to comment on decision that be make q but you have also say from this podium time and time again -- q wait a minute whoa nelly whoa q that that be not under consideration q yes clinton say `` it be not something that be now under consideration '' be that no longer true mr. stephanopoulos i believe the work group a ms. shalala say have look at this prospect but no decision have be make of any kind q well i know but he say tell u about it if it be ever under consideration i take it that now he be and he tell u about it or -- mr. stephanopoulos do he say if it be under consideration or if it be something to be propose q `` if we start consider i 'll tell you '' mr. stephanopoulos if something to be propose q `` if we start consider it i 'll tell you '' a direct quote mr. stephanopoulos the task force have look at a number of different option they have not make any decision yet the president have not make any decision yet this be -- one of the proposal under consideration by the task force be to go out and cast a wide a net a possible for different idea on how to reform the health care system they have cast a very wide net they have look at hundred of different proposal -- probably thousand of different proposal but the president have not make any decision q well be the president aware of their consideration of this option mr. stephanopoulos i know if be briefed on any preliminary conclusion or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind i know that gotten to his level he start yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decision and i believe that be present to him no q well not rely on the usa today to tell him what his task force be consider in the way of tax mr. stephanopoulos no go through it in a very deliberate fashion there be a number of decision that have to be make i know that this proposal have reach that decision- make point q if this be still under consideration a change at least from what be told by dee dee i think about three week ago or so she say that be not an option talk about the -- have a big argument with somebody over this so i remember it specifically -- and say it not once but twice be that not the case mr. stephanopoulos again i know if this have be present to the president a something that be be look at at some level in the task force q it be rule it out though i mean unlike other option that kept in the mix this one specifically be rule out mr. stephanopoulos again this be something that be be look at but no decision have be make of any kind i mean it -- not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase the work group be look at hundred of different option q if it be rule out before and not rule out now then something have change george yes no q when a guy say in february -- mr. stephanopoulos well the work group be look at the wide possible range of option q so something 's change they look at it before look at it now mr. stephanopoulos well i know if the work group have gotten to that point yet they be cast a very wide net q how be it possible that you and dee dee be able to sell -- definitively rule it out a an option previously and now be say that in fact it be be consider mr. stephanopoulos again the work group be look at a wide range of option they have not -- q do you deny that you and dee dee rule it -- flatly rule it out on several occasion in the past month mr. stephanopoulos i deny that -- i mean those be the president 's word those be very clear q subsequent to the president 's word do you deny that within the last month you and dee dee have both publicly rule it out mr. stephanopoulos i know about the timing i think what we do be refer back to the president 's word and say they stand q so they stand any longer q march 25th clinton say for the next four to five year it be rule out mr. stephanopoulos well those word -- the president do say that in february the work group be on a separate track and a i say i believe -- q separate from the president mr. stephanopoulos i believe this have be present to the president q be they consider something that the president -- q have rule out q have rule out i mean will the president consider a vat tax mr. stephanopoulos again the work group have not present this to the president they have look at a wide range of option i suppose that if an argument be make he will clearly listen to it that do not mean he have decide to do it q can we put this another way in his answer in ohio he look at the vat in term of restructuring the whole tax system under those -- that be the circumstance that he say it might be consider at some future point be that no longer the case or be that the only way that he can see a vat emerge mr. stephanopoulos i guess not sure exactly what ask q he talk about the vat in the context of a restructure tax system not a a specific way to finance health care for example q or anything else q or anything else q it be always in the context of substitute for other tax at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system mr. stephanopoulos right q have that change too q be that still his view mr. stephanopoulos i spoken about those specific comment i think -- i can just go back to it -- be the work group -- have they examine the possibility of a vat yes they have q certainly look at a vat she say mr. stephanopoulos they have examine the possibility of a vat have it be present to the president have he make a decision no he have not q what kind of a deal do you have when get the president 's appoint task force obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform go ahead on it own and considers a tax which he have specifically rule out in any context other than much later and then go ahead and announces that what look at be the president concerned about that sort of thing mr. stephanopoulos i think that the president 's concern be to make sure he get the best health care proposal possible concerned with make sure that they have the most thorough process for examine all the possible alternative all the different alternative if a decision be make to go forward with something like that certainly something the president will explain and justify but no decision have be make along those line q what do it mean exactly though when the president rule something out do it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument be make mr. stephanopoulos just -- indisputably true if you -- but at the same time he have not rule it in he have not make a proposal q what make him open to it now when he open to it before mr. stephanopoulos certainly willing to listen to the argument q be he willing to listen to the argument for a short-term tax this year and he willing to listen to it in chilicothe now open to it -- mr. stephanopoulos the context of his comment be that it be not something -- he want to be clear that this be not something he be propose not something he be float q not something he be consider those be his word -- `` not something now under consideration if we start consider it i 'll tell you '' now acknowledge be you not that it be under consideration and -- mr. stephanopoulos acknowledge that the task force have study this proposal i be also state that the president have not make a decision on it q but the door be open for the president to reconsider include this a part of -- mr. stephanopoulos obviously the work group be look at it again but the president have not make a decision q do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the vat to him mr. stephanopoulos i know that i assume that if -- i know what stage they be it in propose i know that go to make the conclusion that this be something they should present to him i know this be something the work group be look at q do you understand george that none of u be ask these question in context of a decision that the president have make only about what the president be consider mr. stephanopoulos i understand that and i be acknowledge that the work group have examine the issue of a vat q and the president will consider it mr. stephanopoulos i assume that he will consider the argument if it be present to him q do that mean the president -- that work group think that when the president say no he mean maybe laughter mr. stephanopoulos i think that mean that the work group be try to do the most thorough job possible q george can i ask you another question about bosnia mr. stephanopoulos sure laughter q no he want u to stay on this q let 's do gay in the military laughter q no he get out of that swamp q i think gotten the bottom line on that vat reggie bartholomew your special ambassador in belgrade today say that if the serb do not accept the agreement that have be work out -- quote -- `` we will do our part to pursue the lift of the arm embargo together with our ally '' that seem to go a bit far than what just say -- mr. stephanopoulos sound almost exactly what i just say q well do you accept -- in other word you accept what reggie -- mr. stephanopoulos well the president have say that this be something under consideration it be something he will consider if the current action bring the serb to the table q there some kind of timetable here mr. stephanopoulos yes there be a timetable there 's go to be a vote on the u.n. resolution in about 10 day q on sanction on tighten the sanction mr. stephanopoulos right sanction and we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope that that will bring the serb to the table a you know mr. bartholomew also met with mr. churkin of russia and they be also work on way to bring the serb to the table we will continue to pressure them in many different way and this be one possible option a well q the question be whether there 's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lift the arm embargo not the sanction mr. stephanopoulos the next vote in the u.n. be on sanction a far a i know there be no vote schedule on lift the arm embargo but it be something that we have discuss both internally and with our ally q why do reggie bartholomew tell the serb that the u.s. would do that what be the point of his tell them that mr. stephanopoulos well clearly i mean this be something under consideration and this be something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table they should know the consequence of fail to come to the table q have they be give a deadline q warren christopher have be say the same thing and it seem to change the serb behavior in the least why should the serb take any heed of a threat to lift the arm embargo when so far everything be do have have no effect on the fight in bosnia mr. stephanopoulos i just accept the premise of your question it have have an effect the embargo be have an effect q what effect mr. stephanopoulos if the serbian choose not to heed our warning then they will face the consequence q what effect have it have in bosnia mr. stephanopoulos well the effect that it have have on the serbian it have tighten up -- they be not get their shipment through we can brief more fully -- q in bosnia george in bosnia what effect have it have mr. stephanopoulos well hard to say if stop the aggression to date that be why continue to press for the serbian to stop but we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the serb and that will have an effect not say go to happen overnight it clearly happen overnight but we believe that over time the sanction can weaken the serb if it fails to work and if the serb fail to come to the negotiate table move forward with the embargo q there a work deadline george of the 24th -- the same date a the u.n. -- the schedule u.n. vote the united state say along with many of the other nato ally that if the serb willing to sign on to the peace accord by then that seek -- we say that we will seek -- mr. stephanopoulos say continually go to -- q but on that deadline mr. stephanopoulos i have a specific date but go to move forward with the resolution the u.n. resolution by around that time and if that fails to take effect if that fails to bring the serb to the table we will clearly consider other action q this awfully incremental mr. stephanopoulos take a step-by-step approach ratchet up the pressure and go to continue to do that q be there a possibility george that by the time all these incremental step be take the serb will have achieve their goal and then what 's the purpose mr. stephanopoulos i think the purpose be to get the serb to stop the aggression we be pursue that goal on many different front we be pursue it through the u.n. pursue it through direct talk we be pursue it through tighten the sanction and we will consider lift the arm embargo we be turn the screw up on the serb and we will continue to do that q but if the effort have be unsuccessful in get the serb to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the serb give back what they 've gain i mean once entrench -- mr. stephanopoulos i speculate on that go to continue to press for them to come to the table now go to continue to find way to stop the aggression but i see into the future q george on the stimulus package house republican say go to hold a series of town meeting on saturday to try and explain the detail of your package they cite poll which show that the more people learn about it the less they like it what 's your strategy to counter that mr. stephanopoulos the strategy we have be the one go to continue a you saw the president today point up the very real benefit of the summer job program that this package will provide 700,000 new summer job this summer for kid in inner city and suburb to do productive work we be also go to point out the benefit of the highway money the investment in highway go to point up the benefit of immunization go to point up the benefit of head start we be go to say that the republican have a choice they can take action to create job or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four year q do it concern you though that the house now the house republican be after you a well a the senate mr. stephanopoulos the house republican vote against it before they make a mistake then make a mistake now q george do it strike anybody in the administration that a bit strong to describe a the president do this morning the summer job program a -- quote -- `` a reaffirmation of a promise of america '' mr. stephanopoulos not at all i think the promise of america to give kid a chance to reach their full potential q government-funded job mr. stephanopoulos to give people a chance to work absolutely that be the promise of america q i want to follow up on something i ask yesterday -- where do 700,000 summer job where do that figure come from mr. stephanopoulos that be on top of i do look at it there be currently 600,000 summer job in the pipeline this will be on top of the 600,000 so it will be a total of 1.3 million q the 700,000 would be create by the stimulus package mr. stephanopoulos yes q where do that number come from because be told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 new job and accord to panetta that break down to something like 200,000 full-time job and 150,000 summer job mr. stephanopoulos yes but the summer -- when you do their full-time equivalence i mean 700,000 individual will receive job this summer when you calculate it for the full-time job effect you have to do -- i know what the exact formula be q seven hundred thousand part-time job -- mr. stephanopoulos -- 150,000 or -- q one to four because three month mr. stephanopoulos thank you q can i follow up on that do the president misspeak this morning when he say that some of the government money for these summer job will pay for private -- for kid to work in the private sector mr. stephanopoulos not necessarily i mean i think that there will be grant available one of the way that you pay for the job at the same time also issue a challenge to the private sector to hire kid on their own a well q tax dollar for instance would pay for kid to work at time-warner mr. stephanopoulos i think the time-warner be actually somebody come forward and actually do a grant go to be the bulk of it there could be isolated instance though where there would be grant to business q have the president spoken with any senate republican this week mr. stephanopoulos no but there 's be a lot of contact with senate republican in the white house q at a low level but the president mr. stephanopoulos the president have not no q get any closer to get the vote mr. stephanopoulos continue to work on it q anybody lean your way q on haiti the new york time seem to be reporting something of a breakthrough in aristide 's attitude towards the coup leader can you confirm that there have be this change and what impact will it have on the process and what do pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report mr. stephanopoulos pezzullo do brief the principal i confirm what 's actually happen in the talk i would leave that to the negotiator themselves but mr. caputo have return to haiti we have receive a briefing here at the white house from ambassador pezzullo and a we have say time and time again we believe that assurance of security be important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement q george yesterday you offer some selective breakdown of how the stimulus would impact some state and city can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these job would be impact mr. stephanopoulos i think we have it for most state yes and i think we can get it out q could you make that generally available mr. stephanopoulos i believe we can q and could you do it by the component of the stimulus in other word -- mr. stephanopoulos i know if we can do -- i know that we can do it by summer job and other job i know how deeply it can be broken down but clearly we can break it down into summer job and other job q and can i follow up be this the information that jeff eller and the rest of the white house be use in the ad in the state mr. stephanopoulos i know if ad but press release q can you describe what those press release contain mr. stephanopoulos all do be point out the benefit of this package to various state for instance i know that today senator dole be head up to vermont and new hampshire and i would point out that the stimulus package the job package creates 1,000 job in vermont it creates 2,000 job in new hampshire and the people of those state should remind him that this be important q where be the release go mr. stephanopoulos they go to the state q to whom mr. stephanopoulos we can get them no problem q can we get it q why you put them out here a well mr. stephanopoulos i think we can q this afternoon would that be possible mr. stephanopoulos i 'll have to check i know but a soon a we can q be you focus these press release on state where there be moderate or pragmatic republican senator mr. stephanopoulos i think try to get a many a we can actually quite difficult to pull this together and do our best put them out a we get them q why be you so closely track senator dole 's schedule mr. stephanopoulos i be just follow it q be press release go along to state where visit mr. stephanopoulos not sure i think that probably there be press release go to vermont laughter q will there be a man in a chicken suit wait laughter q george a the president go about the business of defend what 's in his stimulus package he address what seem to be the republican main point that funding it with deficit spending rather than `` if so important why not come up with the funding for it '' seem to be the republican argument and how do you answer that mr. stephanopoulos what be answer be we be pay for it over time and if you look at our budget we pay for this package over time we believe right now the economy need a jump- start for job q not claim be you that that add to the deficit this year mr. stephanopoulos say pay for it over time i say that q i know that george but i mean from the begin the question -- we do have annual budget and thing -- deficit spending will pay for that this year will it not mr. stephanopoulos this year they clearly will but over time our budget fully pay for this program q what say be that there be saving that would cover this if it be this year in future year mr. stephanopoulos absolutely exactly what i say q i know that but there be go to be outstanding debt it will add to the national debt from this year -- mr. stephanopoulos no reduce the deficit by 500 billion -- 514 billion over the next four year q you mean reduce it below what it would have be mr. stephanopoulos exactly q in fact add a very large amount to the national debt over the period of -- mr. stephanopoulos but reduce it far more from what it would have be true q washington-type reduction laughter q get to be a grumpy old man q george have any decision be make about the white house or the president 's participation in the gay right march come up in a week and a half mr. stephanopoulos work on the president 's schedule now i believe go to be at the senate democratic retreat in jamestown that weekend q will he address it by phone mr. stephanopoulos i know about that a little far out but i believe go to be in the senate retreat q so will he have the leader in a day or two before the speech mr. stephanopoulos i know i would expect that at some point he would meet with the leader of some of these group i know the schedule on it though q will there be an aid czar appoint prior to or in conjunction with the event mr. stephanopoulos just not sure q april 22nd be earth day what be the president go to do to mark that and be it the case that he be go to sign the biodiversity treaty that day mr. stephanopoulos i know there 's be some work on the biodiversity treaty i know about signing it that day but i would expect have a statement on earth day or right around then q where be the work on the biodiversity treaty mr. stephanopoulos have to check with katie mcginty i just know that there 's be some work do but i know exactly what q when be earth day mr. stephanopoulos the 22nd i think q why be it you know that he be go to have a statement on earth day but you know if go to have a statement on the gay right march mr. stephanopoulos i say i know if go to meet or when go to meet q do you have a statement on the gay right march mr. stephanopoulos i actually no i be surprised if he do though q do you have some detail on the miyazawa visit mr. stephanopoulos a work visit on friday and the president be look forward to that in discuss a number of issue include russian aid and the japanese stimulus package and the trade issue between the two country q there be some expectation that a second aid package to russia be go to be unveiled at the g-7 meeting and if i understand it happen why be that or what 's the status on that mr. stephanopoulos the g-7 meeting be still go on and a you know secretary bentsen and christopher have talk about the outline of a possible package but go to continue to consult with congress and our g-7 ally on that q we will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meeting mr. stephanopoulos the meeting 's not over yet q be that when go to make one mr. stephanopoulos not ruling out the possibility q the president 's go to announce it tomorrow q bentsen say that q yes bentsen say it would be tomorrow q so do christopher mr. stephanopoulos have to look at that but i believe it be more likely that the announcement will come out of tokyo q george have there be far consideration here about go to -- send the president out to los angeles mr. stephanopoulos i know that there 's -- not something rule out we have a date set for it q george you all have a position or do you support immigration 's plan to settle 4,000 iraqi prisoner in the united state mr. stephanopoulos the first heard of it q george there be a report today about the -- q fortunately laughter q about the pace of appointment and say that president clinton be behind president bush in the number of position that people have be nominate for be you go to speed up the pace of nomination or where do you stand with it mr. stephanopoulos we fill 814 of the president 's appointment and broken down -- we have 384 schedule c 147 noncareer s 213 pa full-time not sure what that mean -- laughter -- 70 pa full-time and this be about the same -- about the same pace of president bush obviously a you move along farther once you -- each level of appointment actually have a multiplier effect and free up far more appointment so we expect the process to speed up but at the pace of bush obviously like to get these do a quickly a possible i would point out that the fbi background check and the background check be far more comprehensive and it take more time than our predecessor and that be part of the holdup but work on it q be that because of nannygate mr. stephanopoulos i think an awful big part of it yes q in the story this morning you be at approximately the same pace a bush in make appointment but way behind in win confirmation mr. stephanopoulos where the background check come into play the problem q the background check problem because i mean you have a democratic senate -- mr. stephanopoulos no not the -- you make the appointment and then it take quite a bit of time to fill out all the form and have the background check do exactly where the problem be q what 's the president do this afternoon and what 's on the plan for tomorrow mr. stephanopoulos get some meeting -- just office

b"yes sadly this be true the primary reason and the essence of the detail that you be seek be that the grahm-rudman budget control be work in fact they be work so well that unless the fed do something they be go to have to start cut pork so bush and the democrat get together in a budget summit and replace grahm-rudman with the now historic grand compromise in which bush '' consent '' to raise tax in exchange for certain cap on spending increase a it turn out the tax kill the reagan expansion and the cap on spending increase be dispel by clinton in his first act a president so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increase the result be that clinton now hope to reduce the deficit to a level above where it be when reagan left office"

b"if we have back him strongly early on i doubt there would be the problem there be now many russian become disillusion with democracy and reform when they felt rightly imo that the west care yeltsin be virtually promise massive aid once bush get over his gorby-mania this probably kept him from dismantle the congress and call for new election well the aid come through and we make sure it go to the proper place and now the anti-reformers be gain strength where before they be in hiding if they reform i believe in give them money however i think this be too important to take a non-interventionist approach this be what really bug me about libertarianism -- it sound like 'it 'll all be the same in a hundred year time no need to do anything despite the wish of libertarian this society be a far way and get farther from be libertarian perhaps voluntary gift would work if we have the proper framework but we do not have it we have to face the problem *now* not in x year when we have a libertarian dream society right now there be huge stumble block to trade let alone charity there be still limitation to high-tech export nasa buy proton launch vehicle from them sure the market may be able to help a great deal but it right now there be too many obstacle instead of fight against the aid you should be fight to tear down the obstacle the market and charity have to face well i think limited government be primarily democratic due to it be limited but the main question be how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely look like ours btw sometimes it seem that our government be try to go the opposite direction it be not go to be painless and not go to be easy we simply can not wait to help when they *have* the 'proper government never get there without the aid it may be too late already and just excercising mine a i also say above another problem i have be with *transformation* a libertarian society be not go to happen painlessly or overnight i have see nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace they have nuclear weapon 100 year ago nor instantaneous communication nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day yes depend on the ruler of the free market and the business ruler do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinion of every person on the planet there must be check and balance check on the government when it get out of bound and check on industry when it get out of bound put all your hope on the benevolence of the market be to me just like put all your hope on the benevolence of government"

b"the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 15 1993 remark by the president to law enforcement organization the rise garden 2:52 p.m. edt the president good afternoon lady and gentleman two month ago i present a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the american people their job and their economic future the federal budget plan pass congress in record time and create a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country then the short-term job plan i present to congress which would create a half a million job in the next two year pass the house of representative two week ago it now have the support of a majority of the united state senate all of these member of congress know time to get the economy move again to get job growth go again to get a fast start on the investment we need to build a last prosperity unfortunately a minority of the member of the united state senate have use gridlock tactic to prevent their colleague from work the will of the majority on the job bill when congress return i ask every senator from every state and from both party to remember what be at stake the issue be not politics people sixteen million of them be look for full-time job and find them these men and woman care about who 's up or down in washington they care about pay the rent and meeting the mortgage payment about put food on the table and buying shoe for their child about regain a sense of dignity that come from do a day 's work and support their family and draw a paycheck ask those of u who have the privilege of serve to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward i be prepared to do that and i have be work with the senate to come up with an adjust package that meet some of the concern of those who have be block action on the job plan willing to compromise so long a we keep the focus on job keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national need our opponent have be ask for a small package today i ask them to join me in determine exactly what kind and what size package congress can approve that actually meet the need of the american people but even a we make those reduction and the package will be small i believe we must address problem that be on the mind of million of american and one in particular and that be the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime so i will ask even in this reduce package for an additional 200 million in federal funding to help local community to rehire police officer who have be laid off because of the fiscal problem cause by the national recession together with a match effort by local government this could put a many a 10,000 police officer back on the job and back on the beat in community all across our nation at a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime when too many business have close and too many people have lose their job because people be afraid to leave their home rehiring thousand of officer be one of the best investment america can make and i ask both house of congress to make that investment in our people 's safety and in their piece of mind i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy go toward recovery and to create job make no mistake about it i will fight for these priority a hard a i ever have i will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their job their future and for fundamental change i want to thank the police officer who be here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they come here that i have determine to ask for more money in this job bill to rehire police officer they come here because they believe in the summer job portion of the package and i want them to be free to talk about that they come here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they want the kid in this country to have a chance to have job this summer to have safer street and a brighter and more peaceful future i say what i say today not just because good for law enforcement but because good for the people who live in these community i have always support community police not only because it help to prevent crime and to low the crime rate but because it cement well relationship between people in law enforcement and the people that hire to protect it reduces the chance of abusive action by police officer and increase the chance of harmony and safe street at the same time these be the kind of thing that we be try to do i promise in my campaign that do everything i could to put another 100,000 police officer on the street over the next four year this make a good downpayment on that this keep in mind the core of the job package and this will help u to move forward so i ask the people in the senate who have block the job bill let 's work together i can accept a reduce package if you will increase your commitment to safe street i do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer job or to building our infrastructure or to do those other thing that will create real and last prosperity for our people i have do my part now to end the gridlock i ask you to do yours i want now to give the people who be here with me on the platform a chance to make some remark and to be heard by the american people -- begin with janet reno the distinguish attorney general q mr. president can you tell u -- do you think that the job package could be put in far jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at this point in the congressional dialogue the president not at all i think it should have -- they have any relationship one to the other first of all i make absolutely no decision on that you should know that there 's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have ask u to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employer particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate job and to carry the strength of this economy but i have make absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax q do you personally believe that the american public be ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care i mean apart from what business and labor leader have say -- the president not go to speculate on that i will say this the real issue be how quickly we can recycle the benefit of all the saving to cover the cost i mean that be -- everyone know that if you do what propose to do if you streamline the insurance system if you fix the system so that there 's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain service if you provide primary and preventive care in place where it now every single analysis show absolutely massive saving to the health care system the real question be whether you can transfer those saving to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security i have no idea the poll say that but i know all i know be the poll that i see in the press that many of you have commission they say overwhelmingly the american people want the security of an affordable health care system but i think that have anything to do with this stimulus and it certainly have people want a job first and foremost they want that more than anything else q now that announce your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package can you tell u what part of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable i assume summer job be one the president i want the summer job i want the highway program and i want the police program i still intend -- let me say this i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill which do not pas the congress last year this be a supplement to that not a substitute for it in any way but i think we need to do that i think we need the ryan white fund because of the enormous health care burden to the community that be inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problem of care for people with aid and there be several other thing that i think should be do we have to do the agriculture department meat inspector the safety of the public depends on that there be a number of other thing that i -- i think any of it should be cut but i have give senator mitchell and senator byrd -- i talk to them and senator dole call me yesterday to discus this and i told him that i would call him back i call him back last night in new hampshire and we discuss this and i basically ask them to talk today and say that i would not make any statement about any specific until at least they have a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord so i want to be any more specific than i have be already and let 's see if they can talk it out q when you talk to senator dole and senator mitchell do you tell them about your -- increase also that 200 million that you want that a part of the package the president i do -- i told senator -- i left word for senator mitchell last night about it when i talk to senator dole -- i remember for sure -- i do not believe i mention it but i do tell him that i be prepared to reduce the package and i want to break the gridlock and i told him that i be work on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focus on job and the kind of issue that i thought the american people want u to address and this be certainly consistent with that thank you"

almost one month since war broke out in the south atlantic on the surface it seem that only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren wind-swept falkland island and south georgia island in reality far more than that the so-called falklands crisis be just the visible tip of a giant military operation during this month of april 1982 fierce naval battle have take place -- not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific up to now most of the hostility have be kept under wrap by wartime censorship on all side but a i say these word the naval war in the southern hemisphere be about to come to the surface begin today april 30 a total naval and air blockade of the falklands by the royal navy have begin at the same time a counterblockade have be declare by argentina in the same area to be effective a blockade must be impose over a period of time but the royal navy do not have that much time winter be come on in the south atlantic and the british supply line be overextend have come this far her majesty 's navy can not simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few week time without draw blood from argentina a a result the british will be force to undertake military operation very soon no matter how risky they may be there be also another reason why the royal navy now have no choice but to engage the argentine force in combat that reason my friend be that the royal navy have already suffer loss in secret combat this month up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which have be sustain by the british fleet only when publicly admit fight erupts will the british dare to admit that they have suffer battle loss to obtain that cover story the british have no choice but to sail into combat but in do so they will be risk even heavier loss on top of those already sustain in short my friend her majesty 's navy have sail into a trap the event now unfold in the south atlantic carry strange ironic echo of the past for week now be hearing countless commentator refer to the british task force a an '' armada '' quote the british of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description the original spanish armada 400 year ago be renowned a a seemingly invincible fight force but it come to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it change the course of history -- and it be none other than the english navy that destroyed the spanish armada the original spanish armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of england 's queen elizabeth i. the armada be an invasion fleet carry thousand of crack fight men to invade england they be met by the dare sea dog of sir francis drake drake and his small fast ship turn the table on the spanish armada by change the rule of battle the english fleet be equip with new longer-range gun and it stayed upwind and out of reach from there the english pound smash and shatter the big ship of the mighty armada when it be all over barely half the spanish fleet be left to limp back to port drake's defeat of the spanish armada be a shock to the world it open the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start it expansion into a truly global empire today 400 year later history seem to have come full circle queen elizabeth ii be witness the dismantle of the world empire whose heyday begin under queen elizabeth i and now the culture of england and of spain be once again in confrontation once again a so-called armada be prepare for invasion but this time the armada be british not spanish four hundred year ago sir francis drake be the hero of the day today the ghost of francis drake be once again on the scene the south atlantic war zone be at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america the defeat of the spanish armada four century ago broke the back of spain's naval supremacy and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal navy my three special topic for this audio letter be topic 1 -- the military secret of south georgia island topic 2 -- the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic 3 -- the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war topic 1 -- when the falkland island crisis begin early this month it look at first like a tempest in a teapot for a century and a half since 1833 the island have be control by great britain during that entire time british sovereignty over the falklands have be dispute by argentina there have be countless threat by argentina to seize the island which it call the malvinas but the threat have always come to nothing in the past and britain have never even gotten very worried about them the island be four time a distant from argentina a cuba be from the united state and they be not much of a prize after 150 year of occupancy the falklands be home to few than 2,000 british settler and a lot of sheep in short the remote falkland island hardly look like something to fight over and yet here we be watch another crisis take place we be watch a war erupts between great britain and argentina the thatcher government be act a if it have forgotten all about it usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato's doorstep instead britain be throw almost everything get at argentina -- -aircraft carrier cruiser destroyer submarine assault ship -- you name it luxury cruise ship have even be commission and turn into troop carrier overnight wave after wave of additional assault troop have be activate and sent to join the fleet even after it sail ship and submarine have be pull off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the task force the initial 40-ship force have grown steadily over the past several week into an armada number over 70. over two-thirds of the entire royal navy have already be deployed to the south atlantic off argentina watch all this a lot of people be ask what 's this fight really all about the most popular answer suggest in the major medium be `` oil '' vast deposit of oil be know to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands but that have be know for nearly 10 year in no way do it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina this month and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island south georgia island be 800 mile east of the falklands with no know oil deposit anywhere near it and compare to south georgia the falklands be an island paradise south georgia island be cover with rugged mountain treacherous valley glacier and semi-permanent snow most of it be uninhabitable on top of all that argentina have absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island in that respect it stand in sharp contrast to the falklands in the early 1830s the falklands be occupy for a while by argentine colonist in 1833 the british expel them and take over the island for that and other historical reason argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina not britain but no such argument be possible for south georgia island it have always be control by britain never by argentina or spain the argentine seizure of south georgia island look even more unreasonable from a military point of view argentina's leader be military men and they think in military term they be well aware ahead of time that far-off south georgia island could not possibly be held for long by seize it they be set themselves up to absorb a military defeat a the island be retaken by britain so the question be why do argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all my friend the answer to all these question be military not political or economic south georgia island posse an enormous military secret a giant underground installation bury under the mountain at the northwest end of the island the real reason for the so-called falkland crisis be this secret installation together with two other similar installation which i will describe shortly the secret military complex have be in existence for many year they be not new what be new be the accelerate nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planner here in washington for the past two month be reporting the detail of this new war plan to you a quickly a i can obtain and verify them the plan call for nuclear war one to erupt by september of this year 1982 it be this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that cause the so-called falklands crisis to erupt now what be go on now be a coordinate effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the come nuclear war the mutual enemy of the american bolshevik here -- namely the rockefeller cartel -- and russia 's new ruler in the kremlin be behind the present crisis they be try to ruin phase 3 of the `` project z '' war plan which i reveal last month that phase be to be world domination by the american bolshevik after both russia and the united state have be destroyed in nuclear war one a i mention last month the key to this plan be the existence of secret weapon stockpile in various place around the world the american bolshevik military planner here in america be work with other bolshevik agent in key military position of other country to set off war have do that they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have cause safe and cozy in government war bunker when the war nation finally lie smolder and exhaust the bolshevik will leave the shatter remains of their host country they will rendezvous at the secret weapon installation and bring their weapon into the open they will confront the world with the only remain fresh up-to-date powerful military force on earth and use that military power they will become the undisputed ruler of the world -- that be they plan to do all this and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by set off nuclear war one in a matter of month the rockefeller cartel and russia 's new anti-bolshevik ruler be work together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan last month i mention that the bolshevik here be benefitting from war preparation which be start by the rockefeller long ago it have only be about three year since the rockefeller be dislodge a the prime mover of the united state government by the bolshevik since that time the united state government have be a house divide torn by internal power struggle between rival bolshevik and rockefeller faction but before that the united state have be dominate for decade both economically and politically by the four rockefeller brother in 1961 the brother launch a new long-range plan for world domination it be a two-prong strategy half visible and half secret which i first described long ago in audio letter no 28. it be a plan for the united state to arm to the teeth in secret while appear to disarm gradually without repeat all the detail the basic idea be grandiose yet simple by deliberately appear weak the rockefeller-controlled united state would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia then the secret weapon include superweapons would be unleashed to smash russia and take over the world when they set the grand plan in motion in 1961 the rockefeller brother be look ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s their military analyst conclude very early that the war be plan would have very different effect on the northern and southern hemisphere both superpower the united state and the soviet union be locate well up in the northern hemisphere so be the other full-fledged nuclear power -- great britain france red china and india by contrast the strategic target for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere be relatively few and far between in other word it be expect that the come nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war in an all-out nuclear holocaust it be know that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even area not initially hit by war but there be limit to how far the war cloud can spread it be discover long ago that there be very little mix between the air of the northern and southern hemisphere in the northern half of our planet cold air from the north pole work it way southward towards the equator then it work it way back to the north a warm air a mirror image of this process take up the southern half of the planet northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone but very little of the air change place the military conclusion my friend be this the come nuclear war could ruin large area of the northern hemisphere for generation to come but if the calculation be right the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war this be music to the ear of the four rockefeller brother a quick look at the globe of the world show why the rockefeller cartel have dominate latin america ever since world war ii a i discuss in my very first monthly audio letter nelson rockefeller solidify the cartel grip on latin america during the war he accomplish this a so-called `` coordinator of hemispheric defense '' for then-president franklin d. roosevelt so that take care of the south american continent and it natural resource then there be the african continent there too rockefeller control be already in effect over wide area of black africa especially south of the equator all this be thanks to the effort of john d. rockefeller iii a i detailed in audio letter no 36. look around the globe the most important remain land mass from the standpoint of world domination be australia and new zealand thanks to world war ii both be wide open to the rockefeller the rockefeller brother decide to establish secret military installation in the southern hemisphere for use after the come war by this mean they expect to become the master of the survive southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war then a the northern hemisphere gradually recover from the nuclear holocaust the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the piece in this way the third generation rockefeller brother expect their family dynasty to inherit the earth in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war some mean would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass for example revolt against rockefeller domination would require troop -- not a blast from the beam weapon on the moon the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world be found to be a navy a minimum of two secret naval fleet would be require -- one base in the south atlantic the other in the south pacific since the reserve naval fleet be to be kept secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war they could not be built in exist shipyard new construction facility have to be built and they have to be hidden to hide an entire shipyard be no small task they take up a lot of space on top of that it be essential that the ship remain hidden after they be built the best way to achieve that be to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation finally the secret naval installation have to be invulnerable to nuclear attack otherwise if it existence be ever discover prematurely the secret navy might be wipe out the combine requirement for secrecy space and protection against attack be formidable but one day in 1959 while all these plan be still in the early stage of development the answer present itself during a so-called banking trip to sweden david rockefeller be give a tour of a unique hidden naval port the port be hollow out from solid granite cliff which come right down to the water the entrance to the port be a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be seal off with enormous steel door inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity have be hollow out to accommodate ship the rockefeller brother and their military adviser decide that a big more secret well protect version of the swedish hidden port be just what they want a survey of candidate site be then initiate the site survey cover coastal area throughout the southern hemisphere many area be reject very quickly because the topography be wrong other area be reject because they be too close to the equator still others have to be rule out because there be too many people living nearby make the desire level of secrecy impossible finally it be essential that the site chosen for the secret naval installation be totally secure politically at last the site for the secret naval installation be select in the south pacific extreme southern new zealand be select this be what i be allude to in audio letter no 71 three month ago when i call attention to new zealand 's extreme importance in the come war in order to obtain the necessary space the secret new zealand naval installation have to be divide up into two site locate close together one be at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range know a the southern alp come down virtually to the water 's edge the other part of the installation be built into the northwest tip of stewart island which be off the tip of south island the stewart island facility be hollow out within a rise know a mt anglem the new zealand location met all the requirement ever since world war ii the government of new zealand have be tie even closer to the united state than to great britain the location be far from the equator and the installation be bury deep under mountain protect from nuclear attack they be also too deep to be reach by particle-beam attack and the new zealand site be well situate to command the entire south pacific in the south atlantic an even more perfect site be found that site my friend be south georgia island it be locate perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic the tall rugged mountain provide a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island it be control by great britain whose government like that of new zealand be willing to cooperate and south georgia island be virtually uninhabited except for a whale station on the northeast coast the whale station be some 50 mile away from the secret new installation which be be built but britain take no chance in 1965 the whale station be close down since that time there have be no inhabitant on south georgia island except for a few dozen allege antarctic scientist construction of the secret naval facility -- two in new zealand one on south georgia island -- begin in the early 1960 's the technique be adapt from those use previously to build other large underground facility such a the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain colorado however these technique be adapt in radically new way to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland in this way the shelter mountain be left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction the cut in the mountain side which be necessary to let ship in and out be kept a small a possible and be well camouflage like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement the entrance to the secret installation can be seal up when seal the entrance be virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it be and unlike most large construction project there be no tailing or pile of leftover rock lie around to attract attention the man-made cavern which house the secret naval installation be enormous but all the rock and debris be dispose of at sea once the secret naval facility be built they have to be outfit for ship construction and docksite storage the fake disarmament of the united state during the 1960s contribute greatly to this task from 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme he be then-secretary of defense robert mcnamara all through the 60 's mcnamara preside over the public par back of america 's visible military power this include the closing down and dismantle of entire shipyard what we be not told be where all that shipyard equipment go afterwards where it go my friend be to the new secret installation which be be outfit in new zealand and south georgia island the secret naval installation have be use a duplication facility to reproduce certain ship and submarine design and built here in the united state a defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently it be cheaper to build two ship at a time that be especially true if the second ship be an exact duplicate of the first this have become even more true in recent year through the use of computerize manufacturing technique the secret naval fleet which have be built at the secret installation be make up of duplicate -- exact duplicate of certain other ship and submarine they be all nuclear power -- nuclear `` sub '' nuclear cruiser nuclear destroyer and yes nuclear aircraft carrier three of them a secret twin be built for the u.s. nimitz for the u.s. eisenhower and for the newly-launched u.s. carl vincent all have be finance through the gigantic cost overrun so call that we constantly hear about in the defense department and all three carrier have be provide with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture be finance the same way the ship of the secret american bolshevik naval fleet be all duplicate of other nuclear-powered vessel even so the secret naval ship posse one key difference last month i reveal that the so-called `` stealth program '' have succeed in develop a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield this technique make an object invisible from a distance by distort light wave in it vicinity a whole new fleet of phantom war-planes be now go into crash production that use this principle and my friend all of the secret american bolshevik navy ship have already be outfit with similar stealth-field equipment the stealth principle be actually easy to apply to ship than to airplane because there be more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field after nuclear war one the secret stealth navy of the american bolshevik would be light year ahead of any other navy left on earth it would be perfect for the intend role of world domination the rockefeller set it all in motion long ago my friend but three year ago they lose control of the united state military now the american bolshevik who be in control and they be bent on war these secret naval installation have precipitate what be be call the `` falklands crisis '' topic 2 -- in audio letter r no 73 last month i described '' project z '' the new bolshevik three-phase strategy for nuclear war one an elite group of american bolshevik military planner here be flush out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in washington a plan by which the united state will strike the first nuclear blow follow by all-out thermonuclear war with russia have set off the holocaust the bolshevik here and in certain other country plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunker finally after nuclear war one fizzle out in stalemate they plan to leave behind the ash of the united state and her ally activate phase 3 of their grand strategy they plan to unveil their secret weapon especially their secret naval fleet with these they plan to conquer and rule what be left of the world the united state a we know it will be dead and go but in the eye of the bolshevik themselves this outcome will constitute victory up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first reveal two month ago be still on track they be still shoot for nuclear war to begin by september of this year 1982 time be fast run out the bolshevik here be sprint a fast a they can toward war but my friend the bolshevik be not the only runner in this race they have two deadly enemy both of whom be equally determine to trip up the bolshevik one enemy of the bolshevik here be the rockefeller cartel the other enemy be the new anti-bolshevik ruling clique in russia and now these two mutual enemy of the bolshevik be pool their effort in certain way in audio letter no 71 three month ago i report that a limited new anti-bolshevik coalition be in the work between the rockefeller cartel and the russian the january 26 meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva switzerland be a turn point in the formation of this coalition it be now a reality and be responsible for the so-called `` falkland crisis '' now dominate the headline it should be emphasize that this new relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia fall far short of a true alliance they have very major dispute to be settle between them but for the time be they have call a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy -- the bolshevik here in america the first priority of the russian and the rockefeller be to slow down the bolshevik preparation for imminent nuclear war if they can do that time be on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movement which i discuss last summer in audio letter no 67. a slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-bolshevik action to be implement the joint rockefeller-russian planner decide by mid-february that military action against the bolshevik be essential very quickly no other type of action have any hope of take effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer the exact detail of the `` project z '' war plan be not know to either the rockefeller or the russian but the general outline be know to be a i described last month it be decide that military action should be devise that would undermine phase 3 of the bolshevik war plan -- that be the bolshevik-controlled secret naval installation and fleet in the southern hemisphere should be attack and cripple by work together the rockefeller cartel and the russian be able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carry out alone the rockefeller group who built and originally control these base provide detailed intelligence about the best way to attack them the russian with their enormous military machine provide the muscle to actually carry out the attack it be essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleet in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attack survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable military analyst conclude very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facility be out of the question there be no combination of commando frogman or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world any attack on the new zealand base would set off the very war which the rockefeller and russian want to prevent but the situation in the south atlantic be a different matter in a way the great asset of south georgia island be also it achilles heel the extreme isolation which protect the secrecy of the south georgia base also make a covert military assault feasible the key lay with argentina and her long-standing claim to the falkland island a i mention in topic 1 the rockefeller cartel have dominate all of latin america for decade cartel operative be sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there the historic dispute over the falkland island be to be use to provide a ruse a military cover to enable the south georgia base to be attack the argentine general be not told everything about the situation by any mean but they be told enough to make clear what they be to do a an inducement to cooperate the argentine leader be promise handsome reward they be guaranteed that after the shoot be over the falkland island would remain in argentine hand this guarantee include the promise of covert military assistance a need against the royal navy and to bolster the troubled argentine economy it be promise that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserve with these combine promise of military glory and financial reward the argentine military junta agree to the plan on march 19 argentina carry out act 1 in the joint attack plan a group of argentine scrap-metal merchant of all thing land at the abandon old whale station on south georgia island supposedly they be there to dismantle the old building and cart them off to sell while they be at it they also raise the argentine flag over the work-site the british always nervous about south georgia island promptly react a expect the british antarctic survey ship `` endurance '' put 22 marine ashore they drove off the scrap merchant and tore down the argentine flag the incident provide the desire excuse for the argentine junta to bring the simmer 150-year-old falklands dispute to a boil from time to time in the past argentina have claimed that south georgia be part of the falklands because it be administer that way by britain that argument be very flimsy but it now come in very handy it be nothing new to hear this from argentine leader so there be no hint of what be really afoot during late march argentine military force start assemble for an assault on the falklands `` nothing new '' thought the british high command argentina have carry out threaten maneuver in the past many time it be believe that they be about to do it again but on april 2 argentine force do the unexpected after many past false alarm this time they actually invade and seize the island all argentine public statement emphasize the long-standing historical claim to the falklands themselves but just for good measure the next day a small argentine force also seize far-off south georgia island the force be so small that it give the appearance initially that it be just a side show from argentina 's point of view however the small contingent of 22 royal marine be overpower and bundle off the island along with a group of 13 allege scientist that be the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller-russian attack plan thanks to the elaborate distraction stag by the argentine force a special commando team get onto the island undetected base on the detailed rockefeller information about the base the team move to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base special high-speed drilling equipment be set up by the rockefeller member of the team while the russian member concentrate on military defense by late that even april 3 the military high command in london finally learn what be really take place the secret south georgia base be under attack by virtually the only mean possible the joint rockefeller-russian team be drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollow out cavern inside it be only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base once the hole be make the next step be obvious the rockefeller-russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole the best guess be that it would be a nerve gas the shock wave that go through the high level of the british government on the even of april 3 can hardly be described my friend the thatcher government like the so-called reagan administration here in america be bolshevik control why margaret thatcher always say `` me too '' any time the reagan administration say or do anything against russia both government be party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective country and on the even of april 3 they suddenly discover that their precious war plan be in deep deep trouble immediately the thatcher government start assemble a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic haste be the order of the day the drilling on south georgia island be proceed around the clock the best estimate be that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three week on or about april 24. if help do not reach south georgia by then the secret installation might be doom the force station at the installation itself be unable to defend themselves under the circumstance their mighty naval ship be ship in a bottle they do not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commando be arm with tactical and nuclear weapon to open the blast-proof entrance door would be suicide on april 5 just two day after south georgia island be seize some 40 naval ship begin move out of british port the same day lord carrington be sack a foreign minister he be force to resign my friend because he have assist the rockefeller attack plan by downplay the argentine attack preparation that same day april 5 new zealand the home of the other secret naval fleet broke diplomatic relation with argentina the two hidden new zealand facility have be place on `` red alert '' a a precautionary measure all submarine at the twin base be order to sea several surface ship be already at sea undergo `` sea trial '' but that still left seven 7 major ship inside the hidden twin naval base include one of the nuclear aircraft carrier i mention earlier on that busy day of april 5 argentina 's foreign minister costa mendez be at the united nation in new york he be alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy costa mendez hurry here to washington to seek reassurance from certain official he get them for the next two week or so the news be fill with story about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiation go on that my friend be only a cover story the royal navy be actually join up and move a rapidly a possible toward south georgia island if the task force arrive in time to save the secret base a major battle be likely the official story about `` slow movement '' of the british armada be intend to give a cushion of time for that battle if need be the fleet would have several day to retake south georgia island then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announce schedule in this way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserve it be initially expect that advance element of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two week that would have be soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller-russian commando team and stop the drilling before it be complete but russian cosmospheres and submarine make a shamble of the plan key advance element of the south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april 14 two day before it be announce officially shortly after they do so they ran into trouble russian cosmospheres and attack submarine close in on a single ship which be critical to the plan counterassault on south georgia island the cosmospheres bombard the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation in moment the ship be without any command it communication and radar silence then a russian `` sub '' close in and quickly finish off this key british ship with torpedo it broke apart with secondary explosion and sank rapidly so far a be know there be no survivor this unexpected shock in the mid-atlantic produce two result both important first it cause a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada the task force have to be regrouped into a configuration well suit for an enroute defense but that cost valuable time public announcement from london about the progress of the fleet reflect this slowdown the timetable for arrival on battle station near the falklands start stretch out longer and longer all this bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island the drilling continued the other result of the sinking be equally important word be flash to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action it be obvious that the russian navy be get involve in the atlantic which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble during the dead of night early april 15 the seven stealth ship put to sea from their twin secret base in southern new zealand they deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the antipode island 450 mile southeast of new zealand their electromagnetic shield be operating to provide protection from attack these shield make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it a i explain last month but once they arrive at the antipode the stealth ship hooked up to buoy equip with shield communication cable to the island headquarters the antipode headquarters in turn be in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america the deployment of the available ship of the south pacific stealth fleet be exactly what the joint rockefeller-russian planner have hop for the ship have be flush out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in new zealand the british ship 's sinking of april 14 be also follow by other event on april 15 the argentine navy start move out of port the same day alexander haig arrive again in buenos aire supposedly he be there a a diplomat but in reality he be there a a general deal with general haig be the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel a i have reveal in the past he be make sure that the argentine do not get cold foot and back down at that critical moment four day later april 19 haig left for washington a he board his plane haig somberly told reporter `` time be run out '' and so it be my friend for the secret south georgia base the very next day april 20 the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base bolshevik military analyst in london have not expect that it could be complete until at least the follow weekend the british fleet be still out of range the weapon which the commando team insert down through the long hole be a small compact russian neutron bomb when it be detonate inside the confines of the huge artificial cave the effect be devastate the intense radiation instantly kill everyone inside the base also the heat and blast effect of the bomb be believe to have damage all the ship inside sufficiently to badly disable them meanwhile russian cosmospheres and submarine be converge on the stealth ship which be near the antipode island await order from a distance the ship be invisible to the eye due to their protective shield which also protect against beam-weapon attack but they be sit duck for the tactic which the russian employ float overhead the cosmospheres locate the seven ship use their psychoenergetic range-finding equipment know a prf a i have report in the past there be no method know by which prf can be jammed the cosmospheres radioed the exact location of the ship to the attack submarine the `` sub '' be arm with special non-homing non-nuclear torpedo design to explode on impact more sophisticated torpedo would have be thrown off course or detonate prematurely by the protective shield of each ship but these simple torpedo just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode within 15 minute after the attack begin all seven bolshevik stealth ship be on their way to the bottom and with them go their bolshevik commander and mercenary crew collect from around the world the south pacific action take place just after sunset local time the time here in washington be around 2:00 p.m. april 23. that even secretary of state haig be see briefly in public with the new british foreign minister francis pym pym be wear the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomat be taught always to display in public but not haig haig be grin from ear to ear and no wonder the joint rockefeller-russian military operation have be a brilliant success the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet have be virtually wipe out bottle up inside south georgia island and the south pacific fleet while not totally wipe out have be badly cripple by work together the rockefeller cartel and the russian have won the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic 3 -- a i say these word news report give the impression that war be about to erupt in the south atlantic but the real war in the southern hemisphere be already over what we be watch now be the begin of it bloody aftermath that aftermath be the battle for the falkland island they have be promise to argentina a a reward for her role in the secret war at this moment the bolshevik here in washington be press for a public announcement that the united state will side with britain a soon a that take place military action will heat up fast around the falklands britain have no choice but to fight she have already suffer casualty which can not be explain without a public battle but by fight the bolshevik in britain be run the risk of a humiliate and tragic defeat for the royal navy meanwhile the rockefeller strategist here be now concentrate on a fast-building anti-nuclear-war campaign on all side now we be hearing about the so-called `` nuclear freeze movement '' there be documentary article publicity of all kind to sensitize u to the terror of nuclear war in recent month there have even be referendum pop up on election ballot deal with the nuclear war issue medical doctor be banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there be a nuclear war we be be told that all this be just pop up spontaneously we be now 37 year into the nuclear age and nothing like this have ever gain so much momentum before yet now we be suppose to believe that million of american have spontaneously gotten the same idea at the same time if you believe that my friend i give up movement like this never and i mean never develop without leadership organization and money -- and plenty of it what we be watch be the rockefeller public relation machine at work a explain in the past the rockefeller cartel can not afford to let a nuclear war take place if it do they will lose everything because they be not in a position to control it instead the deadly enemy of the rockefeller cartel the bolshevik here will win out if there be a war and so the rockefeller faction be now do everything in it power to prevent a nuclear war the present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interest between them and russia but a russia 's new ruler know very well this do not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller group purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefeller the russian regard the united state a a house divide and they be exploit that division by work in careful way with the rockefeller their first priority be to rid the world of the deadly bolshevik menace of all-out even suicidal nuclear war but once that be do they know that there will be a day of reckon with the rockefeller cartel some day the rockefeller group be work toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda that objective be renew power -- and power that move them closer to their old dream of world government the bolshevik here have unwittingly provide fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign under bolshevik control the so-called reagan administration have become so hawkish that scar people the rockefeller antiwar campaign be design to capitalize on that latent fear a a tool of power these day the smell of war be in the air the falklands crisis be help to make that more intense the rockefeller propaganda machine be now pave the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty be the only way to avoid war a new super-united nation of sort be now in the work to fill the bill it will have teeth a presently envision the new organization will be base in geneva switzerland the work name though this may be change be the `` world nonproliferation council '' the plan be to bring it into be a the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaty but it true purpose will be to use fear -- the fear of war -- to control u all last minute summary now time for my last minute summary in this audio letter i have report on the reason behind the so-called falkland island crisis the crisis erupt because of secret bolshevik-controlled naval installation in the southern hemisphere these have be attack by joint action of the rockefeller cartel and the russian in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable the attack be successful but the result remain to be see one result though be that the royal navy have now be drawn into a trap britain 's waterloo at sea may well be at hand my friend two faction be struggle for control over our united state -- the rockefeller cartel and the bolshevik they differ in style but both seek to control u through fear if we be ever to rise above their trickery it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ our only hope a the scripture tell u our lord `` ... have not give u the spirit of fear but of power of love and of a sound mind '' we must learn to wage peace a our lord declare long ago `` bless be the peacemaker for they shall be call son of god ''"

competitive global economy nation rise and fall on the skill of their worker the competitiveness of their company the imagination of their industry and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business labor and government although many of the economy of the industrialize world be now suffer from slow growth they've make many of the smart investment and the tough choice which our government have for too long ignore why many of them have be move ahead and too many of our people have be fall behind we have an economy today that even when it grows be not produce new job increase the debt of our nation by four time over the last 12 year and we have much to show for it we know that wage of most work people have stop rise that most people be work longer work week and

our bill and the creation of job the issue politics the issue be people million of american be wait for this legislation and counting on it counting on u in washington but the job bill have be ground by gridlock i know the american people be tire of business a usual and politics a usual i know they want u to spin or wheel they want the recovery to get move so i have take a first step to break this gridlock and go the extra mile yesterday i offer to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from 16 billion to 12 billion not what hop for with 16 million american look for full-time work i simply let the bill languish when i know that even a compromise bill will mean hundred of thousand of job for our people the mandate be to act to achieve change and move the country forward by take this initiative in the face of an unrelenting senate talkathon i think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goal first we want to keep the program a much a possible that be need to generate job and meet human need include highway and road construction summer job for young people immunization for child construction of waste water site and aid to small business we also want to keep funding for extend unemployment compensation benefit for people who have be unemployed for a long time because the economy create job second recommend that all the other program in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent and third recommend a new element in this program to help u immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by provide 200 million for city and town to rehire police officer who lose their job during the recession and put them back to work protect our people also go to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it now the people who be filibuster this bill -- the republican senator -- say they vote for it because it increase deficit spending because there 's extra spending this year that already be approve that sound reasonable it here 's what they say this program be more than paid for by budget cut over my five-year budget and this budget be well within the spending limit already approve by the congress this year amaze to me that many of these same senator who be filibuster the bill vote during the previous administration for billion of dollar of the same kind of emergency spending and much of it be not design to put the american people to work this be not about deficit spending we have offer a plan to cut the deficit this be about where your priority be -- on people or on politics keep in mind that our job bill be paid for dollar for dollar it be paid for by budget cut and the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our child i urge all american to take another look at this job and investment program to consider again the benefit for all of u when help make more american partner work to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy you know if every american who want a job have one we have a lot of the other problem we have in this country today this bill be not a miracle a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again but a step we ought to take and it be fully paid for over the life of our budget tell your lawmaker what you think tell them how important the bill

b"in respond to the post below i have consider issue far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have consider the political implication of a racist ideology and it inevitable outcome thus it be tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but i have direct followup to t.p.m since it be principally consideration of the political lesson to be drawn from the history of the nazi party that i deal with let u assume for the sake of argument that this be indeed the case do this mean that hilter would have be in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participate a an active and ardent supporter one of the important thing to realise about the nazi be that the system be far more evil than any single member once create the nazi party itself be a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide there be noone within it strong enough to prevent it remember that hitler do not originaly lead the nazi party nor be he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allow the party to come to power have hitler renege upon the emotiaonal expectation which he have create within the rank of his supporter he would have be replace a he have himself replace the old guard who he beleived be unable to grasp the intellectual implication of their rhetoric this be why all party that espouse nazi style race supremacy ideology must be consider a dangerous and a evil a the nazi the idea that one `` race '' of people be inherently superior to another and that the great goal of humanity be to achieve racial perfection have only one logical outcome the gas chamber of auschwitz the nazi party be not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray beyond the evil of individual there be the evil of the system itself which be self generate and self perpetuate hitler be an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult center on the demonstration of his own power this do not however mean that he be a entirely free from political constraint a he and his propagandist work so hard to assert the myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nation ill must be emphatically reject in the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates it strength and one that be able to govern decisively in the manner it beleives be best i would accept only the latter a a `` strong '' government since most display of strength be make necessary by an essential weakness it be important to understand that the nazi be not stupid nor be they amoral in the sense that they lack moral scruple they act in the same manner a the spanish inquisition murder and torture in the cause of morality the fault of the nazi lie in their axiom not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axiom thus all such party such a the national front or david duke klu klux klan front who assert the truth of those axiom must be consider for what they be advocate of a system that would commit genocide the conclusion that hitler be not only responsible but imensely evil be inescapable from the historical record it be important though to not let the conclusion be reach that the nazi espouse a set of idea that be basically correct but have an unfortunate proponent the evil of the concept of race supremacy be primary although this most emphaticaly do not excuse individual culpability this be nevertheless secondary no matter what the promise make by a racist supremacist party upon election those promise will be broken a soon a circumstance permit if this require the replacement of the leader that originally make the pledge that will occur hatred be a supreme justifier it also creates a dynamic of it own when those in government allow it reign for many in government politics be a method of provide a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance a rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred be inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician thus we have the u raid on tripoli which have little purpose beyond a demonstration of power it be important to realise that there be no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action be take on the basis of that predjudice in the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology it be important though that in attempt to understand the dynamic of political system that this be not use to excuse the participant the leader of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily be require to stive to do so thus to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of one set of axiom to it conclusion in itself be a moral crime furthermore in take on such a duty one be oblige to put the interest of the whole before personal concern even of personal security although it be inevitable that a party such a the nazi base upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbol of power should have saught to commit genocide it be not inevitable that they should succeed each member of the system have an ability to create a change within it that have a possibility of change the dynamic realise that the individual can not hope to control a system do not mean accept that the individual can not affect the system"

b"of course one again face the question of how one circumscribes government power and keep it circumscribed in a complex society when it be in the interest of neither capitalist nor consumer to refrain from use government power for their own end but apart from that little conundrum ... it would seem that a society with a `` fail '' government would be an ideal set for libertarian ideal to be implement now why do you suppose that never seem to occur ... i call it `` vague '' call it elastic all `` regulation '' be not necessarily the same by oppose all government regulation some libertarian treat every system from a command economy to those that regulate relatively free market a identical one reason many of the rest of u find their analysis to be simplistic jsh"
b'if the free market place an attractive price on the screw in of a light bulb you can bet your bottom dollar that the light bulb will most certainly get screw in -- and most promptly at that too'
