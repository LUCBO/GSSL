b"a the shark season come to a close tonight i will start a series of post try to revisit the player the trade the move etc. that go through for the shark for the past season if you be uninterested since i will have the word shark review in the subject head in these posting you can kill them i will first try to evaluate how the player do these rating of course be subject to my own bias but i hope that i can try to be a objective a possible i will evalute player who finish the season with the shark and/or do not play for another nhl team this season thus then let 's go to the goaltender ... 1 brian hayward season 11th acquire '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade p d it be sad that his career have to come to this dim an end a career that feature share three jennings trophy with patrick roy in '87 '88 and '89 it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade and skip the letter grade but he have simply be awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he have be healthy he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie but hayward be a classy individual who also figure in on the shark first ever victory the 3rd game of the season last year against the calgary flame a he retires the fan will remember what a good guy he be 30 jeff hackett season 3rd acquire '91-92 from n. y. islander in expansion draft grade c hackett after deservedly win the team mvp honor last season simply waste the year other than a few good spot 57 save against los angeles almost-shutout against tampa bay etc hackett finish with 85.6 save percentage and a 5.28 gaa watch his status go from the team 's 1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season he be expect early to carry the team along instead he apparently become frustrate but the an early injury that force him to miss 12 game may have be a contribute factor but upon return he simply up to the task he may not return next year 31 wade flaherty season 1st still eligible a rookie acquire '91-92 sign a undrafted free agent grade i a- it be pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he do get against the calgary flame flaherty be nothing but sharp for at least two period he start the season poorly in kansa city but finish strong prompt the blades' owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honor the upcoming ihl playoff would be a major challenge for him a he try to make it into the nhl last year he be a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoff pick up all-star honor along with irbe now time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year because with prospect dan ryder trevor robin and scott cashman come along if he make it next year he may not ever 32 arturs irbe season 1st acquire '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b+ i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly establish that a bona fide nhl goaltender perhaps a bona fide 1 goaltender he have provide most of the little highlight footage that the shark team have get the team 's first ever shut-out against the los angeles king on december 26. he have be fearless in and out of the net aggressively play the puck and make pass remind people of a young ron hextall except of course the goonism yet he still need to develop more consistency which be hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the shark be to challenge for a playoff spot next season irbe 's the key a he demonstrate in be name a a star of the game 13 time in 32 start"

b"everyone keep talk about european expansion by 2010 think wishful thought but be totally off the ball the league format we use here be incompatible with that in europe for those that know the best team from low division get promote and the bad get demote would european fan put up with our `` if paid you can play '' attitude how long would they support team that be run on ranger-based corporate think i use the term lightly we need a good product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa's record every year ... ... 1940 haha sorry have ta say it if hockey and other pro sport have a similar system to europe maybe team like the ranger would be force to compete or get demote the fourth division have many more team ... centre that a big like halifax or adirondack ... .ok so halifax a good example would eventually get promote and every team would be somewhat competetive within it own division unlike ottawa sj edmonton etc. fan would eventually get reward for their loyalty or penalize for their neglect and the league would be more interest and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promote team and the halifax citadel win the stanley cup ... i can dream i look at british or any european soccer a an example they never have fan problem just someone who think our system really suck barfly feel free to flame me my account end today ... hahahaha"

b"i be not at all clear about what you be try to say here if you ask somone who have never heard of hockey before if la played in the smythe division what do you think that the response would be what if you ask this person if la played in the west division the name of division after long-dead entrepreneur be unnecessary obfuscation hardly the `` establish '' situation exist prior to smythe et al the stanley cup be a challenge trophy up for grab to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge what our dear founder do be formalize the challenge they create a close league an oligop- olistic professional system in the interest of make money wheth- er or not that system have contribute to well hockey be certainly debatable we be however stuck with their invention and that de- bate be academic the point to be make however be that people played hockey and people enjoy watch hockey long before smythe and his pal show up what 's wrong with best defenceman period be there ever a well defenceman be there ever a well player and if you think that bruce norris contribution be somehow more significant than bobby orr 's then in the interest of education why you take a poll and find out how many people know who norris be but you have to do you so you feel that you should have to make the effort to remember that vancouver play in the west division or pacific or whatever other intuitively understandable moniker be chosen and of course you neatly delete jason 's jingoistic rant about the game lose it `` canadianization '' quote me out of context do more to erode your credibility than it do mine my position be clearly progressive and be anything but `` bias close mind ig- norant '' arrogant i will grant you nice try john but for a flame to be truly effective you have to display at least enough intelligence to earn your target's respect cordially a always rm"

b"jagr have a high +/- but francis have have more point and take it from an inform observer ronnie francis have have a *much* well season than jaromir jagr this be not to take anything away from jaro who have a decent year although it live up to the expectation of some bowman tend to overplay francis at time because he be a bowman-style player he play hard at all time disregard his defensive responsibility and be a good leader bowman reward him be increase his ice time jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a `` me first '' attitude this rubbed bowman the wrong way and cause him to lose some ice time throughout the year francis consistently recieved more ice time than jagr althouhg i have never see stats on this subject i be pretty sure that jagr have more point per minute played that francis when you add to that jagr 's well +/- rating i think it becomes evident that jagr have a well season- not that francis have a bad one actually what i think have become more evident be that you be determine to flaunt your ignorance at all cost jagr do not have a well season than francis ... to suggest otherwise be an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus/minus ... it be the most mislead hockey stat available until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic include ice time per game and some measure of it `` quality '' i.e. be the player put out in key situation like protect a lead late in the game be he match up against the other team 's top one or two line short-handed etc i would much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of have it dubious merit trumpet by those with little understand of it implication thank you for post this a the person who first brought up the fact that jagr have a much high +/- than francis i can assure you that i brought it up a an example of the absurdity of +/- comparison even on the same team i never ever thought that anyone would argue that jagr 's high +/- actually reflect well two-way play in my opinion francis 's low +/- be purely a result of him be ask to play against opponent top scorer at all time the fact that he can chip in 100 point while neutralize the other team 's top center be a testament to how valuable he be even if his +/- suffers on the other hand jagr for how big fast and skilled he be even get 90 point no matter how inflate his +/- be by the way get me wrong -- i like jagr he may be a lazy floater but he turn it on at exactly the right time -- like overtime of playoff game"

b"the san jose shark and ottawa senator be each on their second gm already ... be willing to wager that both the shark and senator will probably see their 3rd gm 's and perhaps their 4th before we see the panther second"

b"i think you miss one of my point there it take *more* than a great gm to win a stanley cup even once some of the guy on the list you give earlier never won one i agree that you and i could probably argue back and forth for day to no avail about who be the best gm in hockey- that be a matter of opinion and who be to say my opinion be any well than yours or yours than mine but the point of my *original* original post if not well state be that murray have the gm ability but not the coach ability which lead to below i think at this point there 's a personal emotional element involve here which transcends murray 's logical thought a outsider fine for u to say `` he should hire a different coach '' in fact he have talk about do so in the past but the press here in detroit at least have so built up this business about murray never get past the second round of the playoff a a coach that i think he have take it upon himself to prove to the world that he *is* capable of coach a team past the second round he need to a the paper say `` get that monkey off his back '' so it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride be it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic perhaps but all a little that way from time to time i think eventually step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duty and the team will improve a a result i think his coach duty take away time he might have otherwise spent on gm work in that sense once he step down a coach see how good of a gm he really be i may not agree with everything say but be fun discuss it with you"
b'in response to a debate about who have have a well season- jagr of francis i think jagr do he probably have a well point per minute ice time- stats exist to properly analyze this and he have a substancially well +/- +/- be a useful statistic if a player be on the ice when his team score a lot of goal and only allows a few goal he must be do something right it be especially useful to compare between teammates- a they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- rating if they be equally good player it can be adjusted- with vary degree of success to compare between player on different team i agree it would be nice for the nhl to keep more statistics- but how useful be the one that you suggest total ice time would be very useful- it be a miss stat in jagr v francis argument from before somehow measure the quality of ice time a you suggest would be useless it would be a well stat for evaluate coaching- ie be the player give quality ice time actually their talented one a very good player could be give low amount of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who recognize his talent and a very bad player could be give lot of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that think he be an effective player this stat would be much more flaw than +/- and almost no conclusion could be drawn regard player talent +/- be a useful stat it be quite useful in evaluate player talent you be the one display ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that be on the ice when goal be score but not when they be allow be a very positive thing- and should be evaluate a such'
b"after watch the pengiuns all year and a many other team a possible really notice an increase in tom barasso 's cheap shot this year and not notice a corrsponding increase with other goaltender also notice that he usually get away with it just a example last night i notice him elbow scott stevens in the head which basically start the whole shove match that get stevens scott and tocchet 2 minute minor he also kick john mclean of course he call for that kick an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension i think glenn anderson get one a few year ago for kick gaetan duchesne in the chest there 's no doubt in my mind that barasso be the dirtiest golatender since hextall also very good how about that tocchet head-butt be there an automatic susppension that go along with a non-kicking match penalty i remember anymore"
b"robert played in last night game against the shark and get a goal 38th and an assist this definitely bolster calgary 's chance in the playoff rahim hirji"
b'i be under the impression that the objective be to find conclusive evidence that the puck _did_ cross the line and the replay i saw show fairly conclusively that the puck do _not_ cross the goal line at any time anyway somebody screw up'

b"to those who be wonder what be happen in minnesota from what i have see in the local news tv and newspaper various people in the area be try to get a new hockey team a columnist for the st. paul `` pioneer press '' write an article give the `` inside scoop '' on the issue there be three local site compete for a team and three possible candiates to move to the twin city first the site target center civic center st. paul and yes even the met center the columnist be pretty confident that minnesota will get a team and that the target center will ultimately win out he argue however that the competition from the other two site will delay the process considerably without the inter-site competition the columnist sorry i remember his name believe that minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season also because of the situation with the timberwolves thing will be delayed until unless the city of minneapolis take over the target center however they be unlikely to do so until the met center be destroyed because the city will lose money if there be competition from the met for convention and short-term event even with hockey at target to add to this mess a study 6 to 12 month be go to be conduct on the future viability of the met center which obviously delay the process even far i hope that the study be cancel which will have the effect of knock the met center out of the run and perhaps encourage minneapolis to take over the target center sooner the city would be be even more encourged if the wreck ball be take to the met which may happen regard possible candidate the three team be hartford tampa bay and new jersey i would prefer the devil minnesota `` ice demon '' although the lightning may have potential although it be announce yet it look like 6 neutral site game will be played at the target center next year apparently the devil be interested in play in a many of those six game a possible and i be surprised to see hartford and tampa show up there either so minnesota may end up get another team but it may take a few year go sabre"

b"let 's start over not argue about who be the well goaltender take soderstrom right now what i be say be that roussel can be a 1 netminder the gaa difference be less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentage be close and their record be similar and with that i just see how you can label roussel a the most disappoint player on the flyer this season you say soderstrom played against well competition that may very well be but there be no way of know how roussel would have perform in those game besides against the well score team like pittsburgh the defense be more keyed up than they be against san jose but not just judging roussel on that game alone see him play for the past two season in philly and before that in hershey just my opinion but i think get what it take of course i thought that about mark laforest too but i never do about wendell young so batting .500 in judging hershey talent since the hextall-era a for the ranger game you can say he be save by a mistake by the offensive player if you like but rou have his leg in position to make the save if he it have matter if the ranger player get the puck up or not it would have be a goal on a breakaway what the goalie want to do take away a much a possible and force the shooter to beat him i seem to remember roussel do an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyer a tie against the two-time defend champ and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he be senational in that game agains the habs but you tell me that a montreal player have an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out miss it mistake both on offense and defense be part of the game or there 'd never be shutout anyway happy the flyer have both soderstrom and roussel and not go to argue about it anymore besides with the current 7-game win streak and expectation soar for next year i want to piss you off to the point that you sell me any ticket next season"

b"^^ funny you should mention it ... this be exactly the case i be go to make i will grant that a star like mario will draw fan even if the team suck but this be short term only i still do not think the attendance increase will last unless the team be a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one pittsburgh be still get well so people continued to support them if they suddenly drop to say 50 point have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon ok. my number come from the nhl guide and record book you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it but my point be that it mario himself but it be the *expectation* of thing to come i.e a win team that he create by be the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jump in and say nit-picking and mince word go back and read from where this thread start ... it might help to think about what would go through a fan 's mind who suddenly found an interest in mario and the pen be it `` gee mario lemieux be amaze i 'll go watch him play '' or be it `` gee now get a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side i 'll go watch him play '' i think it be the latter i think this be accurate the *tickets* sell but people go to the game i think this thread have already be discuss ... season ticket holder in la always use their ticket so in effect after the king initial success follow gretzky 's arrival 68 to 91 point same source and correspond attendance jump there have be an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sale may not have change much whether or not the king be a 'winner be debatable i claim that since gretzky 's arrival they have at the very least be competitive ... i also claim that mcnall have make a stupid move in try to reassemble the oiler dynasty ... but another story and include only because i like mcnall anyway mcnall do do some heavy marketing around gretzky and that undoubtedly be also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sale etc but a i say when the king have be in there little tailspin over the past couple of year there have be empty seat at the forum even if the ticket be sell for the short term imo although i think that inevitable that the team will improve with a player such a lemieux or gretzky simply because they make people around them well well at least we be in full agreement here so be you say roger have ever have a valid point resist ... yes but they be do no bad than last year i think the same type of reason i apply to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people show up at winnipeg game difficult to predict but do you think that if the jet miss the playoff next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance level i seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improve team would be go with or without selanne"

b"question if a team us 40 player in a season do you merely divide the total +/- by 40 if so a player who play in only 1 game be consider equally valuable a a player who play in all of them since the standard deviation for each team be different i be unsure how '' transferable '' between team that these stats be the average standard deviation in the league be use i be interested in see each method but i still think that mine be the best if for no other reason than familiarity"
b'i would have chosen alex zhitnik for big suprise they do expect that he would become a great defenseman but i think anyone knew that he be go to be this impressive in his rookie year his speed skate ability and puck control be exceptional -- he be the one to watch on the king kris kris fs2.assist.uci.edu go king'
b'my vote fwiw team mvp pat verbeek he fan on 25 of goal mouth feed but he still have 36 goal after a terrible start and have be an examplary sp team captain throughout a tough couple of season honorable mention nick kypreos and mark janssens probably more appropriate in the unsung hero category than mvp but kypreos 17 goal 320+ pim have be the hardest work player on the team and janssens be underrated a a defensive center and checker i guess i place a great emphasis on hard work than skill when determine value big surprise geoff sanderson he have 13 goal and 31 point last season a a center then move to left wing and have so far put up 45 goal and 80+ point he now have a new whaler record 21 power play goal most all come from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot honorable mention andrew cassels and terry yake the kiddie quartet of sanderson poulin nylander and petrovicky have be attract the most attention but cassels be just 23 and will score close to 90 point this season he have quite nicely assume the role of number one center on the team and work very well with sanderson yake bounce around the minor for a number of season but be still 24 and will put up about 20 goal and 50 point this season yake like sanderson start perform well offensively once he be convert from center to wing although lefty sanderson go to the left wing and righty yake go to the right side big disappointment hand down john cullen cullen have a disasterous 77 point season last year his first full season after the trade cullen start the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face appropriate since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his as and whine about it cullen score just 9 point on 19 game be a clubhouse malcontent command the powerplay to a 9 success percentage 21 with sanderson and sulk his way out of town bad of all his 4 year 4m contract have three year left to run so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the maple leaf offer to hartford honorable mention steve konroyd also subpar after signing a 3 year 2.1m contract eric weinrich who show flash of competence but overall have played poorly jim mckenzie who be a much well hockey player two season ago than he be now and frank pietrangelo who only seem to play well when sean burke be out for an extend period and he get to make a number of start in a row'

b'all of this be fine i never say that murray be a bad gm i merely say that he the best gm in hockey- or even a contender for that honor if murray be a great a you claim- the wing would have won the stanley cup by now- probably more than once if he be a great a gm a you claim and he be a poor a coach a you claim- he would have be intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success but murray be an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of this be true anyway'

b'this brings up a question i ask myself no answer when it be mentionned that the nhl could expand in europe would most of the north-americans now play in the nhl be willing to play for a team in europe i do not think that the majority of hockey player be necessarily interested in expand their cultural experience to that level i know i would but i be not a pro hockey player when one recall some player remark in the last few year it make me wonder how a european expansion could be achieve remember these lindros do not want to play in quebec for more than reason nicholls ... in edmonton r. courtnall want to be trade to la only c. lemieux say he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year i know there be many non-cultural reason behind these but there be more some american player who played for the expo complain about the french fact and that the city be not quite like the other u city one player wife try to make her point go on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chip in montreal anybody know what happen when all these u football player move to london spain etc .. for the one year of that new football league 2 year ago i wonder what the player association think about go to europe myself i would like to see some european team but what would be the best way to do it'
b'and while we be on the subject have a captain ever be trade resign or be strip of his title during the season any other team captain trivia would be appreciate ron francis captain of the whaler when he be trade to pittsburgh and rick tochett be the captain of the flyer when trade to the pen recently ... caleb and let u not forget that the new jersey devil trade captain kirk muller for stephen richer and chorske'

b'well now that the hawk have won the division the road be a little easy for the playoff let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweep st.louis that just make it easy in the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det get none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div will be pretty batter also so the advantage go to the hawk again then bring pitt and sure the hawk will probably lose but it well to get that far and lose than to not go'

b"more about the messier-samuelsson incident i agree with rick that ulf 's cross check illegal it be the kind of check you see a dozen time during a game without be call slo-mos sometimes have a tendency to make thing look bad than they really be besides if messier take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen well matt mattias timmander be play with the modo elite league team yet just the modo junior team so i predict he need a few more year here before he can join the b 's i saw him play in the swedish championship game for junior player this year and he played very well a physical game but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie do i suspect you would like to have a ulf type-of-player on the b 's team too a for mariusz czerkawski he have have a *great* season for hammarby in division 1. he score -if i remember correctly- 93 point this season and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in sweden be consider *very good* due to the limited number of game mariusz be djurgarden property he be just on loan to hammarby so he will play in elitserien next season unless the b 's can get him of course i would say that mariusz have to be one of the most excite player to watch in swedish hockey this season staffan"
b"from this account it sound like you even saw the goal mike smith come out from behind his own net and fire a breakout pas that hit fuhr in the back of the leg fuhr be backing up at the time and never saw what happen the puck go straight off fuhr 's leg and into the net fuhr never have a chance there be no play back to the goaltender in fact perry berezan of calgary have just dumped it in and smith be retrieve it it be unfortunate that it happen smith be a nice guy and be only a rookie at the time and on his birthday too but all the blame lie with him start in pee-wee coach tell player never to make a cross-ice pas in front of their own net too much chance of have it intercept or hit the goaltender or whatever and to the people who say that smith cost the oiler the series i can only say that he certainly cause the team to lose the other three game there be no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tie late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round everybody on the team have to take responsibility for them even be in that situation"

b"the flyer team that can beat any team on any night show up at the spectrum sunday night and dominate the maple leaf thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period a the flyer defense kept the leaf from mount any serious attack injury pelle eklund be day-to-day with a bruise thigh roster move jason bowen be add to the lineup for his first nhl game jason be the flyer second pick in the first round 15th overall of the 1992 entry draft 19 year old 6 4 '' 210 lb in 62 game with the tri-city american he have 10 goal 12 assist and 219 pim he play left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor say that bill dineen be planning to use him up front a well andre faust be return to hershey he actually left after the second period of the king game flew to albany get the game tie goal in a bear ot win and played again for hershey sunday night line fedyk-lindros-recchi beranek-brind'amour-dineen lomakin-butsayev-conroy acton-brown galley-mcgill yushkevich-cronin carkner-hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal acton replace lomakin in the 3rd period game summary if the flyer played like this every night be in the playoff this year the flyer hit everything that move they create score chance after score chance they snuffed out everything that the leaf try to do jason bowen make a good play on his first nhl shift that almost create a goal he have the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of take the shot he found brind'amour crash the net on the other side a perfect pas and a good shot across daren puppa 's body should have be a goal but puppa make a great save reading the play garry galley give the maple leaf 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at 4:25. the flyer lowly 21st ranked penalty kill unit be almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leaf get almost nothing but long unscreened shot and the defense swept away every rebound after the power play the flyer get a goal on an ugly play rod brind'amour give the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa make the save and kick the rebound right into the foot of josef beranek and bob rouse who be wrestling in the slot beranek be able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who be skate into the slot from the right circle and he lift a backhander over puppa for a 1-0 flyer lead at 8:10. the flyer kept the pressure on and puppa be the only leaf keep the flyer from building on their lead for a while eventually thing settle down and defense prevail each team get an occasional score chance but the goalie be strong bowen start give some lindros-like check in his own corner then lindros who be look to avenge a hit foligno give him thought he have a chance to even the score he have foligno line up at center ice lean into him and rode him into the center ice board the only problem be that foligno be a little far from the board and mike `` mister '' mcgeough felt that it warrant a boarding call at 15:38 the leaf get anything go on the power play a the flyer be very aggressive for a change on the kill with time run out in the period recchi carry through the neutral zone and hand to lindros a they approach the leaf 's blue line they be in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros try a backhand pas to recchi through the foot of macoun that connect to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then try to clear but it be weak and go right to mcgill who have man the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun get his stick on it and deflect it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. shot be 13-8 flyer in the period the flyer finally get their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind'amour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyer get cheat a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seat at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirm but the faceoff go to the other end a time be run out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pas across the goal mouth but puppa make the save the rebound kick back to the right corner where recchi picked it up pass it out to eric crash through the right circle and eric one-timed past puppa at 7:55. with the assist recchi move past bobby clarke 's 74-75 season the second best one season total for a flyer at 117. eric move up to 4th all time in flyer rookie score with 67 point mike eastwood take down al conroy at 8:30 to give the flyer another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley end the power play with a slash at 9:19. not much happen on the 4 on 4 although the leaf have most of the possession the flyer smother the leaf short power play temper flare a little at 13:14. bowen and pearson get rough minor keith acton get a bloody face dave mcllwain then take a dive and get greg hawgood a hook minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. the replay show that hawgood's stick stop make contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyer smother the leaf power play lead by dimitri yushkevich bowen make a thunder hit when he come out of the box on pearson berehowski try to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he have the puck at the point and just trickle a pas down the slot he make all the flyer look silly a nobody could get a stick on it and it get to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stone him the flyer picked thing up offensively after the kill be over but get anything home shot be 13-10 flyer the flyer be content with the 3 goal lead in the third period and they decide that if tommy want a shutout he be go to have to work for it a little the flyer get most of the score chance in the first 7 or so minute of the period but get past puppa then the leaf get tire of lindros make road kill out of them and temper flare 2 each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and 2 each for glenn anderson and mcgill rough all at 7:02. terry carkner then take a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on gilmour again the flyer smother the leaf power play at about the 12 minute mark dave andreychuk get a shot away from his left circle that get through soderstrom the puck be roll on side and a luck would have it it turn away from the net instead of turn towards it think of how a roll quarter inevitably start to lean one way or the other second later rod brind'amour tripped up gilmour at 12:24 to give the leaf another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stone andreychuk while lie down andreychuk get the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it go straight through and be swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom be equal and preserve the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get temper hot and start a brawl at 16:01. no punch thrown recchi get the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each get rough minor at 17:02 rouse and beranek express their mutual dislike for each other and get 2 each for slash to set up another 4 on 4. mike eastwood shove down ryan mcgill in the flyer zone a they be battling for the puck and while mcgill be down he ran his stick across mcgill 's face the flyer be not happy with that at all 5-8 al conroy pair up with 6-1 berehowski and start throw punch upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each get a couple punch in before go down in a head and al get a stand o penalty eastwood 5 cross check game clark carkner 10 each berehowski and conroy 5 each fight at 17:49. so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyer the have no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind'amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he control the puck and blast it past puppa at 18:39. that be all the firework tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa do but kept the flyer off the board 4-0 flyer shot be 9-8 flyer in the 3rd probably the strong game see from the flyer since the all star break shutout number 4 for soderstrom all since 1/10 tie for 2nd most in the nhl but played few game than belfour 6 or the goalie i remember that tie with next up the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyer can not be eliminate if they win but a loss couple with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyer up to 71 point on the season in 78 game last year they have 75 point in 80 game 5 under .500 so they need at least 8 point in their last 6 game to improve on that only by percentage point 5 under in 84 be well than 5 under in 80 tragic number hold at 3 point with 6 game left the tragic number for 5th be 5 point i watch the ranger blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before i finish this up why 5 point instead of 4 well the flyer will win the tie-breaker if they catch them whereas the islander win tie breaker against the flyer and so need only a tie the ranger could crumble down the stretch a they play the devil the pen twice the flyer and finish up with 2 game against the cap so i guess 5th place could be the goal for the

b"interest one of our german friend here robert told me their forward be all canadian-germans perhaps somebody can sort this out for u ok `` this ai n't north america '' and so on but i still doubt that _any_ city have a pop of 500,000 and below could support an nhl team of course switzerland probably should be judged a one large city because of small distance between city but still dusseldorf yes although the arena be an anachronism an open wall behind one of the goal essentially an outdoor arena cologne 's arena only seat about 7,000-8,000 berlin be about 6,000 and no new facility will be built unless their olympic bid be successful munich do have an arena malmo be big enough but they also need a new arena ... the current one have 5,000 seat i think if talk about the nhl even helsinki would struggle to make it work turku despite an excellent arena and tampere be nowhere near big enough for major league hockey ... rome and the south be out of the question this could a well be africa to hockey fan roman be give the chance to host some wc'94 game but show no interest whatsoever all team in the italian league come from milan and the small city in the north paris have their own `` volans francais '' sp pro team a couple of year ago i believe they even make it to the european club championship final tournament one year but eventually fold due to lower-than-hoped-for attendance the remain city seem to be too small to support a minor sport like hockey the easter city lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey perhaps most european team will have to be like the tampa bay lightning anyway play in a small 10,000 seat arena back by japanese money run by enthusiast phil esposito heavy marketing fan that have difficulty tell what `` ice '' mean ... london have be mention sheffield and birmingham also have large arena and a new mega-facility 16,000 seat might be built in bristol in a couple of year no facility to speak of their big arena in eindhoven seat 2,500 fan for hockey"

b'there be really nothing inherently wrong with it but they try it just a little over a decade ago and noone show up for the early round in the playoff ... whereas soon after they go to the divisional set-up arena be mostly fill in the early round the empirical evidence of the last two decade be that more people will show up to see the bruin play the sabre umpteen time than see the bruin play the captials in the first round maybe hockey have increase in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case the experiment be worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion team but i prefer the divisional playoff'

b"i buy this at all roy be the reason the game be tie ... and that would *not* have be the case have dionne kept his cool hextall give up 2 very questionable goal himself ... both dionne 's and bellow shot be misplayed by hextall but just because his gaffe be early in the game no one seem to care roy stood on his head for the first 15 minute of the game when the nords be rush from end-to-end kamensky 's mini-break after the tie goal and the first shot by young in ot be both excellent chance stop by roy roy outplayed hextall for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero because roy 's team make full use of their opportunity hextall on the other hand have a lot of lucky bounce ... he played very well but the haller shot off the post in ot the rebound bounce over bellow stick the brunet breakaway the 3 chance for leclair ... all those opportunity be *not* finish off by montreal and it cost them hextall particularly brilliant on those play ... sure no excuse ... but it be just the 1 goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they give them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that be totally unnecessary i disagree roy played well because he screen the whole night the defense for the 1st time this season played remarkably keep sakic nolan and sundin out of the slot most of the night this most certainly be a team loss ... leclair miss his opportunity a do bellow and brunet dionne take a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau be *silent* carbonneau and savard be a step behind all night roy give up the bad goal roy by no mean can be single out for this loss and hextall on dionne 's goal please roy be paid big money because that be his value compare to other goalie ... and he still be in the top 5 when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him for most of the season the montreal medium be the quick to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comment against the habs they be no well than uninformed fan why should they read the paper they played 58 minute of `` burnsian '' hockey to shut down quebec all they need tonight and for the rest of the series be the extra 2. red light to face quebec ... rubbish a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. who would be taught a lesson by this the fan the medium and racicot perhaps certainly not the rest of the team if you mean the goal should never have go in because there should never have be an ot then i agree but the goal itself be a great piece of work by young roy have both the near and far post cover but young flip the puck up under roy 's arm a he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all"

b"yeah the news be true ... the leaf lose to the wing 6-3. wish i could say see the whole game but my husband want to watch `` young gun ii '' on another channel sometime between the first time i tune in and d saw the leaf tie and the next time i tune in and heard the score be 5-1 something happen please no woofing from red wing fan my third favourite team and if they make it past the leaf i 'll wish them luck a for potvin ... well it be his fist playoff game"
b"obviously some reporter for the ottawa sun get take by an april fool joke ... probably start by someone with the nordiques or the bruin like for example ... who be go to reimburse the flyer for the 15 million they paid to the nordiques ... like the senator be go to get lindros and 15 million the flyer sent the equivalent of 6 or 7 player when you include the draft choice to quebec and they be go to get only four back some reporter be have real badly and someone must be have a real good laugh see a how the so much of the sport medium have chosen to publicize this utter nonsense can you think ... it can not possibly be true ... no need for the `` if '' i believe that anyone would consider give such crap even the remotest consideration"
b'this be the new buffalo one the second since be with the sabre i recall a price tag of over 700 just for the paint job on that mask and a total price of almost 1500 ouch'
b'frank mich even show at least your parent move you idaho the only thing that get any coverage there be football basketball and baseball'
b'well i recall assume anything except perhaps that the columnist who report the incident be tell the truth i.e the sarcastic impression come from _him_ steve simmons besides to my knowledge alex have a pretty fair grasp of the english language ... and his recent comment after the detroit game would indicate that this remark _is_ what i think it to be very low'
b'i saw a mask once that have drawing of band-aids presumably for every puck that goalie stop with his face/head i remember who it be or even if it be nhl i see quite a few ahl game here this be by far the funniest mask see and for me funny=cool'
b'heard that you can score on belfour by shoot high because he go down a lot and on potvin by shoot high on him and then get the rebound in because he play so deep in the net any truth to these brad'
b"tom barrasso wore a great mask one time last season he unveiled it at a game in boston it be all black with pgh city scene on it the `` golden triangle '' pgh 's downtown area where the 3 river meet grace the top along with a steel mill on one side and the civic arena i think on the other on the back of the helmet be the old pen logo the really fat little penguin with the blue scarf the current at the time pen logo and a space for the `` new '' now current logo tommy have design the mask and his mother an artist paint it for him but while wear the mask the pen get thumped by the bruin the very next game tommy be back to the old paint job a great mask do in by a goalie 's superstition"
b'just curious roger but since you have such a vast knowledge of the game and the league how come you make a living out of it there must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field sure be of great help to say the leaf a an assistant coach or a scout or maybe try a career a a reporter or tv commentator ... i might be wrong of course and you already have'
b'yes a shame that the nhl lose a fine team in one of the best hockey market in the country be a north star fan it be sad to see all of the tradition of the last 26 year get thrown into oblivion at the hand of a truly crappy owner hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin city within the next five year even if this be the case a lot have be lose in the north star move ...'
b'true but accord to your stats chicago have just a good a record a toronto interest that you should list toronto ahead of chicago'
b"the flyer blew a 3-0 lead over the buffalo sabre in the second period but kevin dineen 's 7th career hat trick power them to their 7th consecutive win 7-4 over the sabre who have now lose 7 in a row alexander mogilny lead the comeback score his 75th and 76th goal of the season which tie the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd tommy soderstrom stop 41 of 45 shot on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 a he be test by mogilny and lafontaine all night roster move andre faust be once again recall from hershey shawn cronin be a healthy scratch line eklund-lindros-recchi beranek-brind'amour-dineen lomakin-butsayev-conroy faust-acton-brown galley-bowen yushkevich-hawgood carkner-mcgill tommy soderstrom game summary say if anybody from buffalo be reading this where do you people get that woman who sang the anthem we have to turn down the volume the flyer defense start out the game show everybody why the flyer have be shut team out lately by hold the sabre to only 8 shot in the first period they then show everybody why they will be play golf sunday when they give up 37 shot in the last two period maybe tommy told them that he be get bore back there ... mark recchi open the score so fast that if you blink you miss it after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrap the puck around the board to eric 1/2 way up on his left eric drop it to galley and he sent it ahead to recchi steam out of the zone mark skate into the center circle pass the puck to himself through the leg of richard smehlik skate around him and in on fuhr smehlik be pull at him all the way through the zone with his stick recchi drift right drift back left and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a 1-0 flyer lead at 0:18. it be so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assist the flyer kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that but he be strong and kept the flyer from do far damage the game then become a defensive struggle for a while the sabre get the first chance on the power play when terry carkner take a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunch dale hawerchuk into the board in the flyer zone lafontaine get the only score chance and not a terribly good one a the flyer smother the sabre power play mogilny get a post after it be over the 25th consecutive penalty kill for the flyer keith carney take a hold penalty at 13:31 for take down mark recchi to give the flyer a power play the best penalty kill team in the league allow the flyer a shot on goal although the flyer do create a good score chance for lindros who partially fan on his shot towards the end of the period the play start go end to end but everybody kept miss the net greg hawgood take an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the sabre another power play but they get anything go and the fan express their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shot be 8-6 buffalo after the flyer have lead 6-2 at one point mike emrick interviewed flyer president jay snider between period jay be disappointed to not make the playoff but not discourage this be consider a rebuild year after *the trade* and he seem very happy with the way the season go when ask if he agonize over *the trade* he say that it be rus farwell 's trade and not his that it only be an issue for him and ed snider a far a the money but yes there be some agonize and do it all over again when ask how the coach situation would be handle for next year he say that rus call and rus will evaluate thing at the end of the season he feel that 3 year away from a shot at the cup he expect to get into the playoff next year have a shot at a division title the follow year and a shot at the final the year after that this base on the current level of play and anticipate improvement over the summer very happy with the re-alignment he call it `` outstanding '' happy with the current expansion feel that the talent pool be big enough with the unflux of european but feel that they must make sure exist franchise be stable seem to like the idea of play in the olympics booo but say that there be a definite split among owner and that this certainly would only happen in four year if there be a consensus the sabre give the flyer their second power play of the game when brad may take a trip penalty at 0:51 of the second the flyer have a little trouble get start but eventually do hawgood take a pas a he be move throug the neutral zone and hand the puck to eklund just outside the sabre blue line along the right board eklund carry into the zone nad pass across to dineen who try a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle he half fan on it and sent the puck trickle through the slot fuhr know where it be though and hawgood won the race to it and flip it into essentially an open net at 2:15. then mogilny on a breakaway he slip through two flyer at the blue line and go in on soderstrom he go with the backhander but soderstrom be all over it the flyer then take some bad discipline type penalty that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev take a double minor for rough and high stick when barnaby get under his skin and drew one minor then accord to gary dornhoefer take a dive to get the other there be no video at 4:22. the sabre coudln't get start ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carry into the flyer zone and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerge with it and head the other way it start out a 1 on 1 but brind'amour hustle ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 flyer at 5:40. that be all for fuhr john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over but the sabre still have lot of power play time again they take some time to just get into the flyer zone and when they finally do the flyer be all over them boo begin to ring through the building but they finally get through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik take a shot from the top of the zone that miss and kick out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk try a backhander a he skate towards the goal line to the right a galley dove down to block it mistake 1 he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a the rebound or b barnaby who be camped behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound drop right next to soderstrom and mistake 2 galley just laid there and watch barnaby get three hack at the puck before he finally push it through the goalie he even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at 7:48 two streak end for the flyer 150:28 of shutout hockey and 27 straight penalty kill lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high stick minor i think it be barnaby again this time the sabre be able to get set up quickly but get too much quality on goal the sabre continued to keep the puck in the flyer end for a while after the power play end thing evetually settle down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allow barnaby to get under his skin and slash his stick just before a faceoff the glove be drop and mcgill start pound the crap out of him but during the fight he give barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty 2 for slash 5 fight and 5 for the major 7 minute of power play time for the sabre at 14:15 barnaby only get 5. the flyer be keep them at bay for a while but there be only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chance audette hand to ledyard at the point and ledyard sent a drive that be knock down by soderstrom lafontaine whack at the bounce puck from the left side of the net and knock it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom have move over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner be wave at the puck instead of pick up men wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the flyer lead to 3-2. lafontaine be actually try to put it on net but half fan on it and get a break the flyer then get some shorthanded pressure in the sabre zone but hasek be strong finally it be keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pas to mogilny at the flyer blue line another mini-breakaway for mogilny he elect to shoot from the left circle and he thread the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period be tommy soderstrom talk about cut off angle ... that be all in the 2nd shot be 19-7 sabre into the 3rd period and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyer the lead back a 2 on 1 acton with the puck he drop to eklund in the slot and eklund held the puck a he slid through the left circle until he have almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally do shoot he hit the far post that be still during the carryover power play time than an incredible almost goal randy wood skate around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom go down wood poke the puck under soderstrom and a black object hit the back of the net red light come on horn sound crowd cheer but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be review well it turn out that it be the taped up stick blade that go into the net not the puck emrick mention that one of the criterion for score a goal be that the puck must go into the net ... dave hannan then take out recchi and get a hold minor at 2:35. the flyer could not get anything go at all they finally get set up 1/2 way through but be kept on the perimeter a time ran out beranek strip the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right board and pass it across to eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen head at the net just inside the right circle and pass through to him dineen fumble the pas but twice direct it at hasek and eklund swoop in and chipped the bounce puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42 4-3 flyer but the sabre come right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyer net erry start to skate out but then just drop the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flew in skate around and stuffed it through soderstrom 's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4. then hawerchuk take a retaliatory rough penalty at 5:55. the flyer set up in the sabre zone and stayed there off a faceoff high in the sabre zone in the middle while brind'amour wrestle for the puck dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to hasek 's glove side at 6:44. play start to go back and forth until hawgood take a rough penalty at 8:19. the flyer dumped the puck into the sabre zone brind'amour and ledyard go after it and rod get the puck he back away from the right board skate to the right faceoff dot and pass between his leg to dineen crash through the slot all by himself dineen wait patiently and lift it over the blocker of hasek for a 6-4 flyer lead at 8:39 3rd hat trick of the season for dineen 7th of his career 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season then carney take a trip penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the sabre power play not much action on the 4 on 4 and the sabre get most of the chance on the flyer result power play play go end to end for quite a while after that and both goalie have to make some big save the sabre able to pull hasek a time be run out a the flyer allow any consistant possession for the sabre finally a time be run out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brind'amour strip it away from him he pull away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at the right of hasek he slid the puck between two sabre defender and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday that be all the score shot be 18-13 buffalo and the ice be shower with plastic drinking mug hand out before the game so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who be test much in his last couple of start kevin dineen have a career high 6 point night unless he have a well night earlier in the season but i think so the flyer long win streak in 3 year 30 goal for only 11 against with three shutout eric lindros be 8th in league with 33 even strength goal despite miss 23 game with injury 4 point out of 4th clinched 5th place since the ranger lose the tie breaker a couple misc note forget the mike keenan rumor there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york ranger next year in the last note i mention that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but i fail to mention that the award be for the best defenseman the time of trenton have report that `` a preeminent specialist from oklahoma '' have look over tommy soderstrom 's medical record and determine that no far test be necessary in the near future same paper have a blurb about bill dineen be ask about whether or not he expect to be back next year his response be that he want to come back he feel he do

b"i finally get it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for save and send it 2 rob zettler season 4th acquire '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade c/c- zettler give the shark every bit get this year unfortunately this still enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that he work hard for sure but be no well than average on defense and be prone to costly penalty and defensive lapse at time while be basically an offensive zero 0 goal and 7 assist in 79 game he would be hardpressed to make the team next year 3 david williams season 2nd acquire '91-92 free agent from new jersey grade c/c- imo williams be the most valuable defenseman for the shark in '91-92 play a combination of good offense 3 goal and 25 assist in 56 game and good defense but he play the first part of this season in kansa city be good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appear that '91-92 be a fluke although he improve towards the end of the season he be prone to be out of position defensively and do not demonstrate the playmaking skill that make him the team 's lead scorer among defensemen last year he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year 4 jayson more season 2nd acquire '91-92 from montreal in expansion draft grade b+ after be tout a the team 's top defensive prospect in training camp before '91-92 more have a rather disappoint '91-92 a he be not particularly good defensively and have just 17 point in 46 game he then proceed to improve his game massively this season become the team 's most reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and provide occasional but only occasional offensive flash offensively he be even more disappoint than last year 11 point in 73 game but his defense improve tremendously he be probably best a the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman 5 neil wilkinson season 4th acquire '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b- wilkinson be probably the team 's top defensive defenseman in '91-92 however partially because of injury he be not the same this year a he miss 25 game total due to nag knee and back injury and seem to be slow even when play he then have often to be save by his defensive partner that be if they be there at all but he also have some solid game and if he can be complete healthy he can still be a force 6 sandis ozolinsh season 1st acquire '91-92 2nd round pick in entry draft grade i a at the time of his injury december 30 against the philadelphia flyer ozolinsh be well on track to be imo the team 's mvp a serious knee injury in that game though force him to miss the rest of the season 47 game but he still finish a the team 's top scorer among defensemen 23 point which of course tell more about the lack of offense the shark have from their defensemen but it also tell of ozolinsh 's ability at the time he be play very good defense along with excellent offense he be still susceptible to so-called `` rookie mistake '' but be probably the defenseman who make the least of them on the team rookie or veteran if he can come back from his injury he be ready to be a star 19 doug zmolek season 1st acquire '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b zmolek have basically a solid and durable year be one of the only two shark to play in all 84 game of the season he be solid on defense but after be bill a an offensive defenseman he show it 15 point he be also prone to penalty and his 229 penalty minute be second on the team however that be also an indication that he be fearly when face tough physical opponent and he be at his best when play physically but to become a fixture in this league he need to improve both offensively and defensively and cut down on the number of power-plays he give to opponent"
b'actually messier be invite but decline due to nag injury ... keenan and messier have always gotten along ... keenan dumped steve yzerman from the last canada cup team even though yzerman have endure the training camp when messier who have miss essentially the entire camp recover from injury become available at the last moment'
b"well the patrick division get a little more interest last night the islander lose in ot and the devil tie the pen that mean if the isle beat the devil on friday the will meet the cap in the playoff however i have some more comment on the islander and hockey in general that i need to get off my chest first of all with the islander back-to-back lackluster performance against the whaler one may think that the islander be out of shape these guy always suck wind in the 2nd period come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon it be unbelieveable how many one goal game these guy have lose anyway the game be pretty wide open the isle still have ton of trouble score the whaler played a golie in be 1st nhl start i think his name be lenarduzzi sp his nhl debut be the tuesday tie against the isle like i mention before this guy look like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a mahlakov slap shot to go to ot i say because the isle shoot correctly have anyone else notice this also i think it be really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota get a much ice time a he do this guy have about a much hockey talent a jiggs macdonald who do play hockey i think anytime he get the puck it get steal and he always start fight and get needle penalty richard pilon be another guy who be on the ice to stir up crap and a defenseman get to be approach negative infinity for his plus/minus this guy get beaten all the time why the need for such `` enforcer '' not only do fight slow the game down alot but it take away from the guy who be really try to play the game i 'll be one of the few to admit i do enjoy a good fight once in a while but only when `` call for '' you know when a guy check the goalie too hard in other word a violation of `` hockey ethic '' might cause you to get puched but there be no need to start crap when you be lose or becuase you can get away with it do anyone agree that referee need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and ot i mean come on already sick of see team pull guy down hold guy etc just becuase the referee call it ot and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy not physical prowess try to set up a goal should be first and foremost if you be so afraid that the other team be go to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it you deserve to win in the first place just my honest opinion"

b"stuff delete ... a i recall the author of the _original_ article that start the thread claimed that he disliked the change of the name for a variety of reason roger on one front you flame him rather severely on the ground that his be a `` jingoistic rant '' but you also support the name-changing on the ground that the current name be inappropriate because of the individual they represent fwiw i do not think the flame be warrant nor do i think you enhance what credibility you have with it at all just an observation ... however that aside the real question be whether you like the idea of change the name base on the reason give for it make it easy for the 'casual fan or whether you like the idea of unique divisional name base on individual who do deserve the honour imo the latter be a nice and unique touch that differs from other sport in addition i do not think that change divisional name will have an effect on the number of people that be interested in hockey so a pointless exercise anyway if the current name be inappropriate then that be a separate issue not central to the original article something to consider additionally be whether or not player like orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have be able to do so _without_ an organize professional league to play in in this case honour builder of the _league_ a oppose to builder of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question although it be the chicken ... .. dunno if the stein comparison be justifiable since it look a though his 'unanimous acceptance to the hall will hold up"

name appear on the waiver wire and that kind of invisibility be prevalent for the most part for depalma after be call up october 30 against the tampa bay lightning depalma have an excellent week score 5 point in 3 game while play good defense unfortunately the 27-year-old depalma then disappear the rest of the way get just 3 more point in 15 more game and generally look lethargic and uninterested on both end of the ice he then be sent down to kansa city walk out from there and be suspend and later reinstate when it be reveal that he be injured he then promptly disappear from the watch eye of shark byte a the mail list be now know to shark official faithful and neither the shark nor we miss him 10 johan garpenlov season 3rd acquire '91-92 trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and 8th round pick in '92 entry draft from vancouver grade a/a- after an early slump garpenlov be nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finish with 66 point in 79 game second high total on the team a he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio get most of the credit but garpenlov finish second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrate his playmaking and score skill a he be see make excellent center pass a well a finish pass to him by put the puck past oppose goaltender get a club-high 14 power- play goal contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also show that despite his small size 5 11 '' 183 lb he be willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet he also still need to work on his defense although he improve tremendously throughout the season and be actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season he will be a major key to the offense next year 15 david bruce season 5th acquire '91-92 from st. louis in expansion draft grade i after a banner '91-92 when he lead the team in power-play goal 10 and be third in total score 38 point in 60 game bruce be bother virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 game this season of course it be difficult to speculate how well he would have do this season have he not be affected by the injury but the 28-year-old bruce be effective with a man up or a man short in the shark first season and be expect to be a strong offensive leader this season a well the injury appear serious which be a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the shark next season appear cloud 18 mark pederson season 3rd acquire '92-93 trade with philadelphia for c/lw dave snuggerud grade i b it be difficult for me to understand the flyer decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season 40 point in 58 game but after rid the pine early in the season pederson be summarily sent to the shark in exchange of the defensive-minded snuggerud and he finish with 41 game combine with the flyer and the shark he be also limited by injury this season and this limited his production 17 point but when healthy pederson appear impressive with a good score touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although not consider a physical forward and good speed he also do not appear to be a liability on defense but the shark probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do 20 john carter season 4th acquire '91-92 free agent from boston grade i b+/b carter be definitely one of the hardest worker on the team and the hard work work wonder a at time he look great on ice however although he do look great at time the fact that he receive just 16 point in 55 game for his effort be a sign that there be only so much his hard work can do and the shark confirm that by send him to kansa city with about 20 game left in the season carter who will turn 30 on may 6 always hussled but a a result be sometimes trap too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he be generally a credit on the defensive end but he be probably of limited utility in that capacity and he do not impress offensively although he be one of the best shark at draw penalty he be very unlikely to be back next season 28 jean-francois quintin season 1st acquire '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b+/b i understand why the shark let quintin play any more than the 14 game he played this season he be generally hard-working and create opportunity offensively and appear at age 23 ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the shark finish with 7 point in those 14 game while not be a defensive liability shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited quintin the team 's lead scorer in exhibition game despite sit out the final two to just 29 game with the shark and the blade that season but he look impressive he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season 41 mark beaufait season 1st acquire 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft grade i after a all-star season at kansa city beaufait get a cup of coffey with the shark late in the season when the blade knock down a playoff spot and the shark decimate with injury play 5 game and score a goal for his only nhl point thus far despite small size 5 9 '' 165 lb beaufait be not shy to throw himself around when necessary and look pretty good at time although too early to judge him base on 5 nhl game in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansa city 42 jaroslav otevrel season 1st acquire 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he be up for his cup of tea 7 game midway through the season he be generally very much of a defensive liability and do not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he get in those 7 game he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense be acceptable he should be ready 44 michel picard season 1st acquire '92-93 trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i b-/c+ the 23-year-old picard although he perennially tore up the minor seem to be close to be out of chance for some reason after be acquire by the shark but fail to impress the management in 25 game score 4 goal for his only point and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansa city he be not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minor he have fail thus far to score in the nhl although he have be give limited opportunity he may be the shark bait in the expansion draft 45 dody wood season 1st acquire 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft grade i d+/d although perhaps i give a grade at all i have be accuse of knock on wood too much then it be probably no surprise to you that i be thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although 13 game be a small example he be generally a nonfactor on offense be not particularly good defensively and take too many silly penalty lose many fight in the process and gathering 69 penalty minute in those 13 game project to to 446 in an 84-game season not ready and need at least another season at kc where he can work on his fight skill if nothing else his relatively small size 5 11 '' 181 lb do not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage a an enforcer"

b"'' deeply root rivalry '' ahem jokerit have be around since 1967 and join the top flight only in the early '70s helsingfors ifk have be around since 1897 but fan only start take hockey seriously in the 1960s so i think exagerating here a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the canadian american olympic team have be and they 've have to play accord to our set of rule and on international ice the 1992 olympic team contain about a much talent a your average expansion team canada have eric lindros sean burke joe juneau and chris kontos another four or five have be deep sub in the nhl a for the yank keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco and bill guerin have be 3rd/4th line player in the nhl while robb stauber have do well for the king in goal nothing more in fact sure that an all-star team assemble from the best finnish league team would do no well in the nhl than hartford or tampa bay currently be do -- but what happens if _all_ top-class finnish swedish player gradually end up with helsinki stockholm a the north american-based one gradually retire and no canadian/american team be allow to draft new player from scandinavia here be what the hockey news scout think of our nhl-based player 28-30=superstar 23-27=star 18-22=nhl regular+ 13-17=nhl regular 8-12=role player finland d-jyrki lumme ... ... .20 d-teppo numminen ... .20 d-peter ahola ... ... .13 c-jari kurri ... ... ..25 c-christian ruuttu..16 r-teemu selanne ... ..27 l-esa tikkanen ... ... 20 obviously selanne 's rating would be high today than they be in january sweden d-ulf samuelsson ... .21 d-fredrik olausson..20 d-niklas lidstrom ... 18 d-calle johansson ... 18 d-kjell samuelsson..17 d-tommy sjodin ... ... 13 d-tommy albelin ... ... 7 c-mats sundin ... ... .26 c-thomas steen ... ... 18 r-thomas sandstrom..22 r-ulf dahlen ... ... ..18 r-michael nylander..13 l-per-erik eklund ... 18 l-johan garpenlov ... 16 l-mikael andersson..15 l-jan erixon ... ... ..14 this would be interest clearly finland 's top five player winnipeg's selanne numminen vancouver 's lumme los angeles jari kurri and new york's tikkanen be right up there with any five-man unit pittsburgh co. have but i have my doubt about the home-based finnish player the national team do well in the canada cup and world championship largely due to the effort of markus ketterer the goalie 3-4 or the player list above and luck there's presumably a lot of decent player in finland that be superstar at the high level but still valuable role player however my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a .500 team in the nhl -- sweden be easy to judge because they have more player in north america their point total 16 player be 274 seven more than ottawa 's 22 top player combine if we estimate there be six more nhl regular back home in sweden an all-swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill point deduct some point from pittsburgh ny ranger and other team that rely on swedish player the swedish team would finish in sixth place about a high a boston vancouver calgary and montreal on paper so the `` dynasty '' talk completely unfounded here an all-finnish/all-swedish team might have an advantage because the player would be play at home half of the time have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wide-open european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american check game however if free agency becomes a factor the top scandinavian player still might end up play for large-market team after a couple of year the same way edmonton 's `` dynasty '' crumble in the late '80s some fringe player likely will be draft by other nhl team a have an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all settle for a compromise prohibit all european team from signing a north american during the first two round but allow them to keep their top two player after this the amateur draft should be open to anyone"

b"well i get ta tell ya last night 's leaf game v the devil be a nail-bitter let me tell you it be a well played game by both team i thought but accord to the don and ron it be the an `` off-night '' for the leaf and the devil be outplay toronto well i beg to differ ... imho clark deserve to be a first star a much a gilmour do his fast break towards the net and the good opportunites that he create remind me of the clark of old but not to take any of the credit away from gilmour i think the leaf be play great hockey why well first look at their injury list which include cullen ellet zezel macoun of course my question be this ... .how will the leaf fare when they be once again `` healthy '' if they be play this well so far second just look at their standing still second in defence move from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month lose at home in last 12 game 8 game undefeated streak..etc btw be i wrong or be this potvin 's first shut-out i remember him have any a of yet well a of april 3 we see that the race for first in the norris have truly begin and it will be a very close race between chicago and toronto and the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other be anyone lucky enough to have ticket to see this one come to the stretch and still a roar'in go leaf go"
b"how long can the leaf play short-handed and still be expect to score they do some fine penely-killing in the first 2 men down for a couple of minute at one point but they just keep it up they spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or just come off a penelty -- a soon a get re-grouped penalize again sheesh -- like gilmour say after the 1st -- you go call every little push an shove in a game like that and if go to you have to do it for both team pearson one of my four favorite leaf played like a bonehead -- i saw him personally screw up at least 2 good score opportunity and then he get that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty cullen have gotten strong since his return from injury a hand-full of game ago and he played a good game if the other player on his line can smarten up that line should do okay clark 's get to get tough -- get to intimidate and go for the net send clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple time ... his patent wrist shot will put some number on the board ... and pearson ... heck maybe he should be bench i hate to repeat grape but where the heck be foligno zezel do all the check himself -- and get macllwain on the move ... we need some speed out there keep potvin in net he do okay consider ... although like i say a couple week ago potvin mess up in a couple game in the ahl playoff last year -- he can easily do it again my prediction last week be toronto in 7 -- that the game det win will be blow-outs and the game tor win will be close -- i still stand by that fret leaf fan in order to win in 7 the other team have to win 3 burn be go to make some magic -- mix up some line match the wing line-per-line have his team check hard and never let them get out-numbered in their own end the leaf will win wednesday night ... and will take 1 or their home game probably the first one"

b'never see a game where one player have commit 5 penalty something like this would require more attention by the referee but create a score opportunity where there might not have be one before i can see the relationship between free throw award after a certain number of foul but obviously easy to score in basketball there be more opportunity if a basketball team score 100 point at least fifty chance make the average number of shot take by each team in a hockey game and this be a total guess be probably around 40 and a team be lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them you have some good idea concern the other penalty but i think that a player should be award a penalty shot only when they have a chance to score and be interfere with also later in the post you talk about how boring the nba game you attend be that play be stop too often your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game'

him and take off the recchi goal be a 2 on 1 with lindros the bowen goal be just a puck he threw at the net get a good carom and it end up behind the goalie on the second nylander goal he get three whack at the puck before it go in this be the most frustrate part of the flyer defense take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill be all terrible about this i 'll bet money at least one of them be the closest flyer to the play all i have my radio get bad after that and i be lucky to know who it be that score much less how from what i heard roussel have a very strong game after the game gene hart ask bobby taylor to pick the three star of the season rather than of the game it be garry galley 3 for his career high point total surprised that a former goalie look closer at his defensive play tommy soderstrom 2 for his team record tie 5 shutout in only about 1/2 a season and mark recchi 1 for his all time high team single season score mark but here 's the odd part he decide between lindros and recchi for number 1. if he pick recchi a 1 after he have a hard time choose between him and lindros that make lindros 2 what you wan na know my three star of the season well since you ask ... 1 eric lindros eric dominates a game simply by step out onto the ice the difference between the team 's record with him and without him be no accident i believe that the team could have be almost a successful without recchi there be no question that this team be significantly well with eric lindros on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the c on his jersey next season 2 tommy soderstrom 5 shutout be second in the league to only ed belfour and tommy have a chris chelios booo in front of him he also play a complete season due to heart problem sentimental edge here my family have a history of heart problem there 's no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom be this team goalie of the future and if roussel complains again about be number 2 look for him to be trade within 2 year 3 mark recchi again you argue with an all-time team high single season score mark there be an awful lot of team that have a single player get a many point plus mark be the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice honorable mention rod brind'amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year the difference be that he on the top line this year and get a much play time then again he get the defensive attention that he get last year from the other team either dimtri yushkevich be the team most consistent defenseman yes he make rookie mistake but he be usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feel that with his shot score a few more point next year without give up anything in his own zone and i suspect that be the team top defenseman in year to come garry galley be the team 's point leader from defensemen again there be some thing you just argue with and he battle with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only miss one game and that be against his wish under doctor order but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year brent fedyk be the league big improvement over last year point total but consistency become a problem for him a couple misc note mostly for mail list member tom misnik a member of the mail list would like to exchange e-mail address with any list member who want to keep in touch over
