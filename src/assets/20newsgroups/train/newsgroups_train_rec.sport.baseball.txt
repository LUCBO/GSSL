b"oh yeah dave winfield -- marginal player guy hit a lick have negligible power be a crap fielder and have no stay power dave winfield now enter his i believe 20th big league season be still a damn decent hitter admittedly his defense have slip a great deal but in his prime he have a powerful arm and great range take a look at the stats i know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman be similar player kingman be a one-dimension power hitter -- he field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp that hideous ... and for those who consider such thing important be a absolute-primo-dick eddie murray yup only the best 1st baseman of the 80 's i know that mvp vote be conduct by mediots but give that he get jobbed out of the mvp he deserve in 1983 it seem that he overrate by the medium lee smith hmmmm ... this one 's actually pretty close have a s solid dependable career a a closer despite pitch in some nasty park wrigley fenway ... have to take a closer look at the stats be a while but it seem lee arthur be of hof caliber you do make a legitimate point about the hof credential of reliever simply rack up a lot of save mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta use reardon a a closer for longer than he should have be one the equalizer have rack up an impressive number of save no way should homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hof'er lem me ask you this who the hell play the game be n't marginal now wait a goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefine the position of shortstop his defense be so good that won something along the line of 10 gold glove again gold glove be mediot-biased and a good argument could be make that larkin deserve one or two of ozzie 's more recent award but usually this be temper by someone else in the early 80 's get the gold glove ozzie deserve earlier in his career ozzie's offense you ask good obp great speed number in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power 'cept against tom niedenfuer -| but still a definite asset offensively yount 3,000 hit mvp at two different position uh-huh a real stiff his '82 be one of the great year ever by a player in recent memory and probably rank behind only the peak season of wagner and bank a far a s number go a clear hof'er imho well a far a garvey go right garvey be a `` mediot '' candidate push because of his `` win attitude '' a minor factor if one at all and his `` great defense '' no error admittedly but the range of a tree stump ... garvey be in the hof skyjack say a lot of nasty thing about skyjack in the last year or so but this be mostly in response to mediots and woofer who talk about morris `` ability to win '' which be nothing more than morris `` ability to pitch when toronto to score ton of run '' at this point morris be an average pitcher although from his early return in '93 he may be damn close to done. but in all fairness morris be a dominant pitcher in the 80 's for up-and-down tiger team while 1984 be obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team be generally in contention but not favorite morris career number be quite good and worthy of hof '' consideration '' ryan of course but be careful i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about `` yount and smith be shortstop who hung around a long time '' after all nolan never won a cy ... damn just pitcher who hung around for 99 year ... his w-l record be mediocre ... of course nolan 's a hof'er ... puck probably although get to play reasonably well for a few more year 10 year even good one enough to make the hof most likely that say i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turn out bar something really tragic or sudden very popular in the medium and with fan and legitimately have be one of the best cf 's in the game since he join the league always like the guy and i hope he do make it and in the end i think the puck will make it in but really too early to sell this debate come up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not i never tire of it an interest subject here 's an off the top of my head list of potential hof'ers from each team i probably left a couple of guy off so feel free to follow up i consider anyone who start play after about 1985 again too early to tell note these be all active player not counting recent retiree baltimore cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrig 's record stand boston roger clemens might be a lock already which be amaze dawson detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibility milwaukee robin yount discuss earlier new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morris possibility kansa city george brett lock minnesota kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange cub sandberg lock st. louis ozzie lock lee smith probably new york murray almost a lock saberhagen obviously get to regain past form and most certainly not vince coleman despite what tell you los angeles butler strawberry and hershiser be all long shot san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot colorado dale murphy a good shot ryan bowen just to see if awake before i get flame this be an off-the-top-of-the-head list there's probably a few deserve candidate that i left off and i include barry bond will clark any atlanta start pitcher frank thomas canseco mcgriff etc because i only consider guy who start play before 1985 e-mail or post i almost fear what i may have start here ..."
b"be follow the giant closely over the off-season -- newspaper notesgroup etc -- but i have my first up close and personal last night at the stick after watch giant hitter struggle last year barry 's swing be very impressive -- very quick and his swing seem effortless even compare to clark particularly clark a of late it be interest to see bond hit maddux so well not sure if barry be after revenge against the brave or what but he stroke three very pretty hit 1b 2b hr for 5 rbi 's the giant a a team be do a lot of surprising thing this year in addition to bond there have be some good pitch and some hitter seem to be swing much well clayton 's defense have be superb mcgee seem to like lead off this year manwaring be drive the ball so on so forth i hope it continue ... i think they need to continue well into june before people be really sell that they be for real -- particularly the pitch for myself i think the fresh start of magowan/baker/etc have really wipe out a lot of negative from the last few year and will be a real factor in help them significantly improve over last year"

b"we have no way of know because we can not separate morris contribu- tion from the rest of the team 's there be only one way of determin- ing `` best '' in baseball and that be by look at the scoreboard at the end of the game each game determines which *team* be the best that day at the end of the season the team that be the best the most often be the best in the division the playoff determine the best of the best but the point be that the only decision make pro- ce use to determine the `` best '' be the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams* not the individual player there be no method inherent in baseball of compare individual performance and that be how it should be because after all baseball be a team game to say that one player be well than another be to be able to say ab- solutely that player a 's team would have played well with player b in their lineup sheer speculation impossible to ascertain if you want to select a group of statistic and claim that clemens have do well with those statistic a a criterion then fine but you have to be able to prove that those statistic measure the individual 's contribution to win the w because that be the only measure of `` best '' that have any meaning in the context of base- ball so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a w cham- pionship more than morris your evaluation of clemens be totally sub- jective and be mere opinion i have yet to see that any of you can predict a w winner with any great accuracy than jeanne dixon exactly the jay won with morris pitch and boston win with clemens pitch i be not say that morris be well than clemens i be say that individual comparison between player be totally meaningless and that anyone claim that clemens be well base on his era have miss the point of what baseball be all about you have to be rude for you to say that mean that you have either miss the entire point of my argument or you yourself have commit a fallacy ignoratio elenchi i be not say that morris be well than clemens because he have more ring although i have tongue in cheek claimed that in the past i be say that it be impossible to isolate an individual 's performance from that of his team 's for the purpose of compare that individual 's performance with another individual 's per- formance the stats be a nice hobby and about it there be no new knowledge be produce so when a poster claim that morris be well than clemens because he have more ring the poster be no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hound --"

b"off and on over the last several month thread about rbi and related topic have gotten me to think about how well we can predict a player 's rbi use information about his overall performance and the number of runner in score position risp that he bat with in the brock2 model bill james calculate predict rbi a rbi=.235* total base home run this completely ignores the context which be all that brock2 could do since context be unknown to it so i thought take that idea a a start point and look how good a fit to the data you get by compare rbi-home run to slg*risp start with team data use data from the elia 's that picked up over the year when a i could afford them and b i could stomach the thought of increase elia 's profit that give me the year 1984-1986 1988 and 1990 i have team rbi for '87 or i could add that year if you run a simple least square fit to the data you get rbi-home run 0.81*slg*risp the correlation between the lh and the rh be 0.86 which be significant at a ridiculously high level so i feel like the fit be good at the team level no start to move on to the player level and have look at 4 player will clark ozzie smith joe carter and don mattingly i hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year it do too badly except the equation underpredicts the low hr hitter smith which may be a fault of the model or it could just be ozzie the result rbi-hr year actual predict carter 84-88,90 400 402.6 clark 87,88,90,92 269 269.6 matt'ly 84-88,90 471 460.8 smith 84-88,90 317 280.6 i think we can make a case and i hope to make it strong that rbi can be predict simply from know how a player slug overall and how many men be in score position when he come up more later harold"

b"but good one can collapse somewhat then come back the next year burleigh grime go from 20+ win and an era of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an era around 4 in '25 he pitch well for several more year carlton won 13 and lose 20 the year after his 27-10 record source bill james historical baseball abstract and let 's not forget john tudor who start 1-5 and finish 21-6 in 1985. he have a pretty bad era when you take busch stadium into account at the start of the season if i recall he have a 4.50 era in the 1st half and a 3.50 era in the 2nd half of last year hmmm 21 run in 11 inning suppose he start 30 more game and wind up w/200 inning pitch if he allows 4 run a game in the next 189 inning have a 4.75 era or so at the end of the year i think i have his total right this be go to be hard to come back from my 1st hunch be that morris be very gutsy and that he may be pitch through an injury and not tell anyone my 2nd guess be that he will be banish to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more start perhaps when stewart come off the dl or will danny cox who go 3 or 4 scoreless inning against the tribe today start for morris he look like a really good one gaston be scramble to find starter imagine luckily the jay have a very good offense i think they would dare release him before the end of the year just be replace by stewart or cox"
b"so far simmons look like a total idiot 1 zane smith should learn how to `` switchpitch '' and return from the dl i would rather have zane smith pitch right hand than have moeller pitch at all 2 i be sure simmons be ready to say i told you so after otto have an impressive win last week now otto 's late debacle have restore simmon's reputation now he look like he be back in his '92 form when he have the al 's high era among starter four our sake not ted 's sake i hope he pitch with a 3.5 era for the rest of the season yeah right 3 tomlin and merced be a bit disappoint they be still do decently but consider the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have show their first season they seem to have actually gotten a little bit bad tomlin be almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batter merced have a very good oba his rookie year he show a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year 4 walk well he seem to be on the lose end tonight but i still think that walk desrved his contract 5 leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation i understand his and management 's fear of lose tom prince through waiver even if they do what 's the use he be aright hander like slaught not a very smart platoon also i be blame leyland in this case since he be hcurrently convince that lavalliere be through while give him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoff slaught should have played in all 7 game he have a good average against right hand pitch leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere very fit last year 6 dennis moeller be scary 7 candeleria well he be not go to have such a high era at the end of the season maybe it will be in 3-4 range but 1 million plus come on other than the customary home run give stage patterson go through for a few week patterson have serve the pirate very well each year so far he seem to have pitch well for the ranger i think the pirate should have spent the money on patterson in stead 8 the rookie batter well young have surprised me a bit with his instant impact other than that their excellent performance be too much of a surprise i think we should thank doughty for that 9 rookie pitcher bad than expect especially cooke 10 slaught how come he give a contract extension last year now his value have increase immensely 11 lonnie smith well eric davis be sign for a comparable amount let 's see eric can hit well he can run well he can field well now why didnt the pirate go after eric davis an injured davis be well than a healthy lonnie smith even if lonnnie smith get some big hit this year he be an asset he have look terrible on the base and in the field 12 management big big zero sauer have yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue share he seem more concerned about please that idiot danforth by prepare the team for a move to tampa bay 13 alex cole fiasco the pirate infield and cf position look good the rf and lf would have look good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielder eric davis van slyke and cole would have make a very respectable outfield even without eric davis thye pirate would have a respectable outfield with cole svan slyke and merced i think he should hit left hand against left in stead of switch hit simmons do have option for the outfield ironically the big accomplishment of simmon 's tenure be get alex cole really cheap too bad 14 compensatory draft pick for bond forget it the pirate can rant and rave they will not get those pick a of now the issue be still be appeal now if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer be idiot nothing else will on a final note tim wakefield be a awful a he be in his last 2 start but count on him pitch like last year for the rest of the season also if the pirate be in contention towards rthe end of the season they will miss redus 's clutch hit and his speed he have peaked in the second half of the last 2 season"

b"this be the crux of the argument to me at least both the sdcn and the non-sdcn camp seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense be basically nonmeasurable at present you can talk about how important call a game be or frame the pitch or block ball in the dirt but there be little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher 's rank in `` defense '' look at lopez specifically be there any reason to suspect that he be a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the brave or the medium have label him a bad defensive catcher a far a i can tell he have any particular problem in his mechanic such a sasser he might be a little rough around the edge in block the ball or frame the pitch to get a good call but all he need to clear that up be play and practice time i see how repetition at aaa be any well then rep in the major all left with be the call the game aspect olsen and berryhill at always give credit for call good game and help the pitchering staff but this be a reputation that be give to almost all veteran catcher how be catch at aaa go to help lopez learn the major league pitch staff the only way any catcher be go to learn tom glavine 's pitch be to catch tom glavine similarly i be supprised if the pitcher 's claimed to prefer pitch to olsen over pitch to lopez because they be use to pitch to olsen but give time they will say they be comfortable with lopez now since lopez learn how to handle the major league pitcher 's while in aaa and since he have any glare problem in his mechanic what be he go to learn in aaa that he learn just a well while in the major"

b"i agree and disagree john be say that the batter effort will result in 4 more win then loss while you be probably correct that 400 do not mean 4 more win then loss it mean something i would rather have a player who increase my team chance of win by 1 in each of 400 pa then i would a player who increase my chance of win by .5 in each of 400 pa thus there appear to me to be an obvious positive association between john 's statistic and win game thus before you disregard this stat it appear to me that far study must go into what sort of relationship there be the only problem here be an insistance that these number mean exactly how many win the team have first we be use average over many season and apply them to one game second remember some player performance take away from the chance of you win that be a player who get an out get a `` negative probability '' in most case thus not sure in any give game when you add up all the number for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one also the pitcher bad performance give up 6 run may have give them a large negative percentage for that game also any batter that pull an 0-4 night would give large negative no but really only because you have a small sample size i would think however that the number of run you score in the first inning would be just a good a a prediction a how many run you score in the last inning and realize something else a closer usually come in in a close situation not a blow out it be hard to argue that any run that a closer give up in a game have equal importance to those give up in the first inning look a closer give up run often mean a team will lose many game on the other hand a starter who give up run often still leaf his team a chance to win the offence have many more out to do something about but i be not say all late inning situation be equally important either if i be down 8 run in the ninth it really do not matter how many run my pitcher give up in the ninth no but why would you assume that the team probability of win would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throw be make look if you be down 1 point with 5 second left there be a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you be in possesion of the ball and do not forget that somebody el miss shot turnover foul bad defense etc cause a `` negative chance '' that the team would win from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent be do so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness but it really do not cluthness revolves around the idea that certain player in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance go down never see convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there be no clutchness then that mean that except for a lot of noice this statistic have a positive association to player performance there be a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run be for example we may find for instance that a home run increase your chance of win by 15 on average while a strikeout decrease your chance of win by 5 i bet if this be do we would find that this statistic be just a good a other statistic we have for predict win and loss how do we evaluate relief pitcher say john and sam have the exact same pitch statistic run earn run k 's bb 's etc both have exceptional number john however only pitch in closer situation while sam be a mop up man who be more valuble to their team probably john who be the well pitcher they be probably about the same"
b"not quite sure how these number be generate it appear that in a neutral park bo 's hr and slug tend to drop he actually loses two home run or do they what be `` equivalent average '' one thing when look at bo 's stats be that you can see that kc take away some homer normally you expect some would-be homer to go for double or triple in big park or to be caught and for that matter you expect lot of double and triple anyway but bo despite his speed hit very few double and not that many triple so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park felix jose have be a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park i would offhand guess the 89- 90 bo at around a .330/.530 player maybe .330/.550 not even close put him about there too note i realize the medium have hyped him so much i thought he be always view by them a a well football player and only so-so at baseball he do only have one 30-hr 100-rbi season and kc win note 2 i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there be a mistake be make by the sdcn 's a they be know on this group with respect to player like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others we find that if you look at a large group of player their past major and minor league number will predict their future number fairly well their be some caveat the young they be the less good the prediction the low the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent the player have left college ball etc now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of `` error '' sometimes a player with poor mle 's dave justice the 1990 ventura becomes a star some hitter develop shane mack brian down some oddibe mcdowell mickey brantley this error involves real thing there be real reason why oddibe hit and shane do it may who know involve park and batting coach and wheaties and injury and lift and so on but still you have this big pool of player and thing work pretty well one of the reason for these prediction accuracy be the common background of the player one thing we know about professional baseball player be that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time play ball their background be similar what be establish be what happens when you encounter a player with a different background be there some reason to believe that a bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn or an ainge or so on have such a different background that the standard model and standard assumption fit this person slowly it be establish that you can use mle 's with two-sport player it be establish that you but then statistic be after all an art i personally think otherwise lucid individual continually make completely nonsensical statement about bo and deion and lofton `` look at those good-but-not-great minor league number '' they say well what happens if those number simply mean what they usually mean it might mean that ken lofton suddenly have a well year in houston than tuscon it might mean that deion suddenly have a well half-year in atlanta than greenville then again it might not ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor mle 's but you guy do n't know what 's bad you know that you and you know that there be other player you know about -- injury and lift and wheaties again you seem to think that the model be perfect and eternal not get some error oh well bill guilford"
b'this be my opinion the stupidest thing in the hidden game the argument be 1 defense or run allow be 50 of the game 2 unearned run amount to 12 of the run allow earn run 88 3 since unearned run be the result of fielding not pitch and earn run be the product of pitch not fielding fielding be 12 of defense and pitch be 88 of defense 4 caombining with 1 pitch be 44 of the game fielding 6 pete be usually sharper than that my own feel be that fielding be in the 25-33 of defense range call it 30-70 between fielding and pitch give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe 45-5 or even 40-10. give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds identical batting stats which be that unreasonable and even if you let roberto steal a single base score a lot more than the oleruds by go first-to-third more often no offense gordon'

b'lou want morris all along the idiot give the man 40 million to play with be like give a five year old a load uzi with the safety off the only question be how many shot he will get off before somebody be wise enough to take it away i see why people expect boston to finish sixth the bottom four team last year be essentially tie boston in seventh place have 73 win the yankee and indian tie for fourth place have 76 win now i should think it be obvious that the red sox improve more than the indian or tiger basically the red sox be strong this year at 1b dh s lf and rf they have healthier start pitcher so far at least and well reliever i see no reason why they win ~85 game meanwhile the indian be in shamble and the tiger *still* have no pitch they will win some 20-3 blowout but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 game too *maybe* the sox will play poorly win 78 game and finish fifth but i think third or fourth place be more likely'
b"would you say the same thing about the dodger in '65 or '66 true cone be probably a good a drysdale and they have no koufax but still these team be win with home run leader who have very bad total with lot of low-scoring game etc and they use reliever whereas jeff montgomery be have a super season for them that be say i still picked them 5th or so but i think a superb pitch team can win if they have enough hit there 's more of a chance of that i think than of a team with tremendous hit but no pitch at least to me i wonder though which one do you people think would do well a team with johnson koufax in his prime seaver carlton and young in no real order a the starter with sutter finger and lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assume good defense like mazeroski maranville etc or a team with poor pitch but with an offense of cobb carew ruth gehrig may schmidt wagner and bench again you pick the order i would postulate that the pitch one would be several game well by season end even the best hitter can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best year but a great pitcher can throw lot of shutout take all the player in their prime they might throw 50 shutout in a year and all the offense would have to do be get 1 run across i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all- time team into a regular season have it played and report the result i would love to see that"
b"can anybody name a player who be 'rushed to the major let 's for argument 's sake define `` rush '' a brought up to the major for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or young and perform below expectation whose career be damage by this rush serious i tend to agree with david that bring the player up sooner be well but like to look at player for whom this theory work if there be any prefer player within the last 10 year or so because then i can look up their minor league stats important to distinguish between player who legitimately have career below what their minor league number would have project a oppose to player who be hyped and fail but actually have career not out of line with their minor league number let 's kick it off with an example of a player who be `` rush '' although there seem to have be any damage to his career jay bell be give 135 pa in the major league at age 21 and perform well below what you would expect from his aaa number the same season he get 236 pa the next year at age 22 and still underperformed however the next year at age 24 his performance improve and he won the everyday shortstop job and have be there ever since really hard for me to see where he would have be well off stay in the minor league where he be perform quite well in aaa during this time rather than be `` rush '' cleveland might have be well off i suppose because they might have be less likely to give up on him yes if you bring a player up early likely go to struggle but do that delay the time at which he stop struggle and start perform up to expectation"

b"not a cliche and unlike your comment below not a tautology it need n't have be true if every pitcher in baseball be essentially the same in quality i.e if the variance of pitch ability be much small than the variance of batting ability then score run would be much more important than prevent them simply because the *ability* to actively prevent run would be much weaker if your point you should have say so what you in fact say be '' pitch and defense win championship '' and later `` pitch be the essence of baseball '' neither of which say what you be now claim be `` your point '' and neither of which be true and you accuse sherri of mouth cliche not clear to me at all that this be true in high-scoring game the team with the well offense win a high percentage of the time in low- score game the split be essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability i thought you say `` pitch and defense win championship '' and `` pitch be the essence of baseball ''"

b"well actually most of ours be base on what really happen and yours be base on some fantasy of how it happen but ok i understand you have a hockey background stats like `` plus/minus '' make rbi look good ok how about a straigh answer then here 's a very simele question to which sure a fair number of u be very inter in the answer to please answer yes or no roger can a pitcher cause the offensive player on his team to score more run al only please for anyone else follow along it be a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team 's win-loss record be closely related to the number of run the team score and the number the team allows not a definite hard-and-fast function but there be definitely a correlation in fact a a rule of thumb if team a and b both score x run and team a allows y run for every 10 run few than y that team b allows it will win another game so for instance if we look at the 1991 toronto blue jay we find that they score 780 run and allow 682 of which morris allow 114. all other thing be equal if frank viola with his 3.44 era have replace jack morris for the 240.2 inning morris threw plausible since viola threw 238 for boston the `` red jay '' would have allow about 15 few run or enough for 1-2 more win now that take into account that viola pitch half his inning in fenway which be a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome so um roger unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of run his team score could you enlighten u to the fallacy in this analysis clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he have be on the jay last year but that be not the claim we look at what the actual performance be and evaluate viola 's a well than morris in the sense that `` have morris perform a viola do his team would have be well off '' this be true but not so open that your brain fall out mike jones aix high-end development mjones donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com"

b"i be try to think how to respond to this without involve personal feel or perception and i can not without have stats to back up my point however i think you approach this the wrong way i believe all of the people mention here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman do i feel they be all much well player i be not say i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more imho dave kingman definately not they guy only have a couple of year be he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he be very fear by pitcher i also do not think he do a lot for the game i mean really i be a met fan he be a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he be fear by pitcher he have have several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production number be in my opinion without stats well than kingman 's probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not a much a some other people but none the less a leader i think he have make substantial contribution to the game of baseball and to society example of this be some of the charitable thing he have do i know some of this from when he be with the yankee i think he the type of player that kid can look up to and while this be definately not the only criterion for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration lee smith maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the like of kingman darrell evans no eddie murray maybe he have have a very good career he be a leader although a silent one he be a good role model be the stats good enough i be not sure but i would once again believe they be much well than kingman 's both the average a well a the power number but not a good a winfield 's just think eddie do not have a much publicity for most of his great year jeff reardon my guess be no but it kind of depends on his number off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well i strongly disagree here both of these guy deserve it for sure i talk about leadership above both of these guy be leader and have be instumental in lead their team to the post season robin do have very good offensive number both average and power and ozzie have okay number offensively the difference with ozzie be that if you give him a home run for every run he save by make an incredible play at shortstop he would have shatter aaron 's home run mark by now how many of those great play save game how many of those great play motivate his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guy have number baseball be about more than number or at least win at baseball be about more than number both of these guy be proven star and belong in the hall of fame a do george brett who also belongs in this class of player steve garvey i be not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone make a case for him jack morris once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name kirby puckett probably the only reason i do not say definately be he still have time left in his career if he continue do what he have be then my probably will turn into a definately nolan ryan be there really any doubt i think i heard something about him have some 53 record maybe they be not all good i know i do not hear any of them just the number he have the number he have the contribution to the game and community and he be a great role model i would not say that he be the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top 20 but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishment no-hitter strikeout respectable number even with some weaker team you can go on and on i really hope he get all the possible vote so in sum up i have 3 group those that belong those that probably do but i be not sure and those that i lean towards say belong at least not without my see stats and possibly hearing reason why they should go yes winfield yount brett not in your mail o. smith puckett and ryan maybe murray and l. smith no reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman a i say i do not have the stats around so i do not have number to back this up these be entirely my opinion base on my perception"

b"hi baseball fan so what do you say you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield ho-hum be seriously be consider for it a be lee smith ha then why we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame take in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon well in any case i be sick and tire mostly sick of everybody give hall of fame consideration to player that be by today 's standard marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount belong there both shortstop that just hung around for a long time big deal let 's be a little more selective huh stop hand out these honor so liberally save them for the guy who really deserve it face it if something do there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individual believe that steve garvey or jack morris be potential candidate the absurdity be apparent gee can these guy even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan"
b'i well no problem but i get pretty annoyed when they swing at non-strikes and make out especially ball four on the 3-2 count ... dave'
b'educate yourself before you rip on this year manager of the year lankford injured himself in a previous game and torre be rest him a far a the whitten/gilkey controversy whitten add some more need power and if jordan continue to hit the way he have be gilkey will find himself in the start lineup soon enough sam'
b"the same bill james why do you say that it sound like suggest bill james have something to do with overhyping the kid to death au contraire he be fairly critical of him after his roy campaign note that he all-world a a catcher or a hitter he call him basically average when everyone *else* in the medium be predict the next johnny bench or roy campanella which report be those i like hernandez a lot but if piazza can catch the ball get ta play him imho a much well hitter although hernandez a *bad* hitter right now it sound like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez will be candiotti 's caddy since he can catch the knuckler a long a they play up to their ability the dodger could have a very good catch tandem i think both be overrate defensively see nichols law of catcher defense but something difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine about the only tangible thing we can look at be opponent 's sb and cloud by how well your pitcher hold runner catcher era be a possibility but subject to way too many bias a for them 'playing on a team that be not so much in need of another big bat i disagree here too about the only chink in the brave armor be that weak offensively at several position cf c 2b s if belliard play 1b unless bream and hunter form another super-platoon and very weak defensively if blauser play like to see the brave give at least one of mel nieves javy lopez or chipper jones a shot but much like the talent-rich jay of recent year be conservative and stick with what they have not say wrong just conservative"
b'the dodger have be shopping harris to other team in their quest for more left-handed pitch so far no taker personally i think harris be a defensive liability and he have also lead the team in past year for hit into double play or at least be among the leader sharperson show last year that if give a chance to play every day he can get the job do if sharpy played just one base every day say third also improve defensively wallach have help tremendously on defense a have reed the improve defense be quite noticeable and be have an effect on the pitch staff both astacio and martinez be bail out in recent start by great defensive play martinez pitch into the ninth in a game that might have see him lift in the third in past year astacio last 7 inning the other day under similar circumstance the dodger be turn double play and keep more ball in the infield than last year and piazza have also be great on defense he have thrown out 10 of 14 batter try to steal and have at least one pick off at first wallach clearly have contribute to the over all improvement on defense but his offense be awful and he have cost the dodger some run but i think he be a bad a his current average i suspect he will come out of this slump much a davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs'
b"i personally will never forget mike schmidt 's home run against the expo in 1980 that decide the nl east it be also his career high 48th"
b'methinks you recall wrong mitchell hit close to .300 in atlanta and continued to walk alot after his promotion he be then i think left off the playoff roster and start the next year in the minor where even the brave will tell you he underperformed because he be so mad at go back down he struggle last year no doubt but even the brave blame part of it on the demotion much rather have mitchell than say mark whiten on the card'
b"well my question still be answer if spanky be bad enough to release this year why do he get so much play time last year yes i know he be part of a platoon and why he get more play time than slaught but that answer the question if slaught be so obviously well this year this also obvious last year and he have be take away some of spanky 's play time against righties"

b"be go over some video last night ... .. study 1986 and 1992 videotape of jose canseco prove to be very interest and enlighten here 's my analysis of jose canseco circa sep '92 and jose canseco circa june 1986 1. bulk up too much period he need to lose about 20 pound not gain more bulk 2. his bat speed have absolutely vanished conservatively say lose 4 -7 of his bat speed and a huge amount of speed 3. that open stance be kill him note that he act sort of like brian down way open to start then close up a ball be release down could do this without significant head movement canseco also note that canseco always close his stance the same way sometimes his hip be open sometimes fully close without a good start point hard to make adjustment in your swing what would i do if i be jose aside from salt away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that never have to work again restructure my entire swing first minimize movement before the swing close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely second drop 20 pound cut out the weight work third relax the wrist will cost some power but until i can find my 1988 stroke concentrate on keep the back shoulder up roll the wrist through the strike zone and hit line drive his strength be more than enough so that some of those line drive will get out of the park if canseco 's open stance and result bad habit be a result of his back problem be out of baseball in three year if not he could still hit 600+ hr"
b"since i be the one responsible for these divergent thread of approx 40+ post go back to the brave could be well off if an injury happens i may a well inject a little more fuel to the flame 1 back at the begin of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily olson be still recover from his late-season injury knee i believe and there be question a to whether he would be able to play before june and then berryhill be ding up i be look forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position before last season he be the brave `` defensive catcher '' prospect while brian deak be the brave `` offensive catcher '' prospect besides olson and berryhill hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and walk enough to be useful but olson recover quickly berryhill recover and the brave go with the two vet i still say that if one of those two have be down at the start of the season he have gotten his job back 2 there be a certain logic to keep olson and berryhill around after all ml catcher be in short supply and suffer from wear and tear there be team out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind certainly try to move olson or berryhill through waiver would be unlikely to work plus have to eat that salary which huge but tiddleywinks either i think olson 's at about 800,000 berryhill at 450,000 but only what i recall 3 yes i think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also what be it that 5/6 of the 2+year player eligible for arbitration only the 1/6 that be on the roster the long be eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change be not yet know from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until june/the first time olson/berryhill go on the dl 4 i be still disappointed that lopez on the team i still prefer to think of myself a a fan when it come to the brave and the truth be that rather see our best team on the field which imo include lopez of course today we play the cub hopefully we need him a for the schuerholz/cox conversation i imagine it go like this remember they 've both be gm 's the follow be not meant to be read by the humor-impaired cox ok sent jones down his fielding could be a little smoother besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding be well than it use to be schuerholz well have to send nieves down too deion just sign that baseball only contract we count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense besides gorman 's not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet once hatcher 's go and deion sign we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to give u some pitch depth in 1995. cox yep that 'll be nice too bad deion sign ok i 'll look for nieves when justice start have berry-berry ... er back problem again now what about klesko schuerholz well still get to fork out another 1.5 mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera i keep dangle sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he seem to be the same gm first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark if he get rid of brian jordan then have to believe that he and whitey herzog switch body at the winter meeting cox ok keep try on bream and i 'll wait til the trading deadline for my hunter/klesko platoon maybe i can get a few extra at-bat for cabrera while we wait try california ... if snow start slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that work then perhaps sid 's knee could be `` persuade '' to act up there 's always the 15-day dl mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well not that much well than lemke maybe if he start in richmond start walk more besides if go to be arbitration-eligible well to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he make the big buck schuerholz now let 's see that leaf lopez cox nooooo i get ta keep lopez sure i think olson would recover this quickly maybe i can talk caminiti into run into him again schuerholz nope lopez have get ta go you know that get 3 million in arbitration may a well put it off that one extra year besides until olson 's show his stuff a little bit i trade him besides berryhill 's a left-handed hitter you know how rare that be cox you mean a left-handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he make pat border look good in the world series pat border schuerholz hey the one who write lopez into the lineup cox well the one who go out and get me jeff reardon besides i thought lopez be use to our pitch staff 's stuff he get some time with them this spring ... look pretty good come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep will be hurt by may cox ok ok you make your point keep them both surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the late then i can call up lopez and then we can win 110 game the pennant the world series i 'll be up there with john mcgraw casey stengel earl weaver oh they laugh at me in toronto but have you ever have to deal with george bell i 'll finally get my just reward mwa-ha-ha-ha schuerholz easy bobby have you be take those '' happy pill '' left around by chuck tanner

b"i hope that this come off a a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wip i go to school in philadelphia and i listen to both station on a consistant basis now that the fan have mike lupica on from 10 to noon they have a person who can get the big name guest for interview and not just of local importance he do have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show but he have bob costa and magic johnson on too now here be my opinion of the two station compete talent morning show in my opinion i think imu be much well than bruno cataldi and morganti even though i would feel different if morganti have a well crew of people to work with to me wip try to copy imu but make it all sport a a theme in term of sport imu lack the blanketing of the airwave but he interjects humor and politics into his show 10 be to 12 noon i think chuck cooperstein and lupica be equal in their ability to host a radio show but i think chuck have the advantage over lupica in term of deal with the caller who be ask about who the local team be go to draft in the sixth round lupica and the other host on fan get well interview guest but i heard the pd of wip say that they be not interested in interview with celebrity unless it be a major story i would consider this even because they be two different style of host 12 noon to 2 pm at this point i would have to give a big advantage to jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny have only be on for a couple of week i just think jm have the ability to transcend the `` homer '' mentality of the philadelphia fan base this be most evident when the iggles philadelphia spell play the cowboy because jm be a huge dallas fan where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egg of the host re wip morning 'guys i do agree that jm be great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotate host i feel that jm be the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin if you be in ny and you get wip jm do fill in on the weekend sometimes 2pm to 4pm this be the time when jm go up against francesa and russo fatso and froot loop and i become the most divide in my loyalty mike and the dog be very entertain but they often go an hour or so without call or even 10 to 20 minute without talk about sport matd do get great guest and that be the basis for their show so it be like the 10 to 12 debate another plus be the appearance by mike and chris on imu in the morning which be often hilarious 4 pm to 7 pm matd go up against frederick and missanelli i like mike missanelli but i just stomach steve frederick i know that sf come from philly originally but when he be at the fan he be a ny homer a much a he be a philly homer now i listen to wip much after 4 pm unless there be a game on that night but you will see later for the reason that be why i give the advantage to fan 7 pm to midnight s m be on wip until 8 and then it be the man who make eli that call matd all the time seem like a novice on charge of racism g cobb this man be so grate on my nerve that if i listen to him for a few minute i go nut i know that be bias but listen to his show on fan there be usually a game on knicks ranger mets jet or st. john 's basketball if the game be on the west coast then it be usually howie rise of course i think dead air would be well than g cobb on wip but wip do air sixer and flyer game during the season if this be the sport station why do they lose the iggles to wysp home of howard stern in phil during the summer it be all talk on wip overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of 10 to 12 and 2 to 4 where it be even and 12 to 2 where wip have the advantage rich"

b'one last infield fly question that have always puzzle me and yet be address i believe the rule also do *not* deal with this situation if infield fly be declare and the ball be caught runner can tag up and advance at their own risk a on any fly ball however if the infield fly be *not* caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base w/o fear of be double off for advance too early when the ball hit the ground when a fielder first touch the ball after it hit the ground enlightenment would be appreciate'

b"i meant to comment on this at the time there 's just no way baserunning could be that important if it be run create be nearly a accurate a it be run create be usually about 90-95 accurate on a team level and there 's a lot more than baserunning that have to account for the remain percent"
b"how many run will be score in denver i know but some idea can be gotten by look at the run score in mile high stadium during the last few year of the bears/zephyrs tenure in the american association here 's the total run score per game in zephyr game all league game and the ratio i found the same ratio for hr year rpg lea ratio hrpg lea ratio 1992 10.22 9.10 1.12 1.65 1.58 1.04 1991 9.53 8.87 1.07 1.41 1.26 1.12 1990 10.71 8.72 1.23 1.49 1.24 1.20 1989 9.07 8.34 1.09 1.27 1.11 1.14 1988 9.90 8.37 1.18 1.29 1.08 1.19 1987 12.55 10.70 1.17 2.39 1.92 1.24 1986 9.45 9.33 1.01 1.35 1.38 .98 1985 9.50 8.54 1.11 1.53 1.34 1.14 1984 9.99 9.10 1.10 1.55 1.59 .97 1983 10.60 9.99 1.06 2.03 1.74 1.17 1982 11.29 10.35 1.09 2.24 1.91 1.17 1981 10.29 9.25 1.11 1.43 1.49 .96 1980 10.59 9.43 1.12 1.63 1.46 1.12 1446/13 -- 1.11 1444/13 -- 1.11 it seem pretty clear that denver will have a large effect on run score i 'll stick with my prediction from last year that it 'll be one of the top 3 in the nl this year and a fairly large effect on homeruns though apparently not a large a atlanta wrigley cincinnati and san diego still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park"

b"dave winfield 's name do not go in term of peak and i repeat peak year winfield have do it all he have bat in the 340 's for a season drove in 100 and more run many time in a row before his injury consistently hit at or near 300 while knock in 35 home run have you even look at dave winfield 's slug percentage for three or 4 of his best season i still think that dave be one of the well of all time but obviously not the best he be one of the best athlete evr to play baseball he hit line drive that hit the scoreboard in left-center field a feat np one have do in the new stadium heck only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence since it have be remodel he could field have a bullet arm and his hit be comparable in many season to gary sheffield and barry bond of last season he be old now and slow down take more of an uppercut to lift the ball out of the park but he will always be my hero and my idol there be nothing that could make me happier than george invite dave back to the bronx to play his last year of ball with the yankee of course he will most likely refuse the offer but who know for 3 million dollar play heck they be give gallego 2.5 million this year have dave a their dh while leave him time to play the field when tartabull be injured or nokes and mass be trade should give the yank the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age of yankee domination"

b"the medium be beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death but i see anything in rsb yet gerald perry of the cardinal pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run he stroke a line drive into the right field corner the ball clear the three-foot high fence and go into the crowd darryl race over from right center get to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he miss the ball a fan sit in the front row wear a mitt reach up and caught the ball home run now see the replay several time and i have conclude that darryl miss the ball and that the fan 's glove be essentially behind darryl 's several dodger fan with seat in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfere with strawberry what can not be dispute however be that the fan who caught the ball never take his eye off it he be oblivious to where the fielder be play he be also quite exuberant a soon a he realize he have make the catch that exuberance disappear immediately however when strawberry go into a tirade at the man all report indicate he use a lot of profanity and accuse the man of interference and therefore of cost the dodger a game shortly afterwards other fan hurl food and beverage toward the man who make the catch dodger stadium official start to remove him from the park but then relent and just relocate him to another area in an interview after the game lasorda blame the fan for the loss strawberry also go into a tirade about how the fan be stupid and they care about win l.a. time columnist similarly blast the man who make the catch before each dodger game the public address announcer make a speech wherein he say that fan be welcome to the souvenir of ball that be hit into the stand a long a they do not interfere with any that be in the field of play be the fan wrong should he have be more aware of the situation and act to avoid any possibility of interference or be he human and just react by the way he be a season ticket holder and on his request the dodger have relocate his seat to another area of the stadium where future interference be impossible others have question why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan do when he have a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine game i question what he be do in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line have he be closer to the play he certainly would have have a much well chance of catch the ball but i guess the big debate continue a to what be the responsibility of the fan -- the beastmaster"
