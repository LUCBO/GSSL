b"mg i go buying simms recently and the sale person told me that the mg be 9-chip simms and 3-chip simms and one can not use them interchan mg if you use one you have to use all of the same type believe everything you be told i can tell you that mix them between 'banks ok and i see why mix in one bank be not unless they be of different speed e.g mix of 60ns and 100ns simms in one bank the two only differ in the type of chip it us assume that the simms be 1mx9 9 bit wide here be the two equivalent configuration the 3-chip simm us two 4-bit wide 4mbit 1m of 4-bit nibble and one 1-bit wide 1mbit chip for a total of 9-bit wide 1mbyte the 9-bit simm us nine 1-bit wide 1mbit chip these be equivalent because of the way that it be 'pinned on the simm board at the simm interface they both act a 9-bit wide 1mbyte simms 2*4+1=9*1 sorry if too techie for ya mg similarly one can not plug in two 1mb simms and one 4mb simms to gi mg the system a total of 6 meg why be that so if my system support mg of 8 meg it have 8 simm slot can i plug in 4 4mb simms to give my mg 16mb that sound correct the problem be that if your computer take 9-bit wide simms you can not mix different size in one bank why you ask simple if you understand why there be bank assume you have a 32-bit cpu 386dx or 486 the data bus e.g the mechanism to retrieve data from memory be 32-bits wide so the computer expect to see 32 bit when it asks for data to get that bandwidth 32-bit wide the motherboard link 4 1mx9 one bit be not data but parity so i will ignore that in this simple explaination to get 32bits 9-1 *4=32 bit that mean that a simm in a bank store only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data if you have a 16-bit bus two 1mx9 simms be link together to get 16-bit wide data which be the reason why 286 bank be 2 simms wide and 32-bit bank be 4 simms wide if your computer require 1mx36 e.g 32-bit wide data with 4 parity bit use in some ps/2s and asts you could upgrade by one simm at a time hope that this message be not over your head but the answer to your question be not simple i could of just say 'because i say so -rdd -- winqwk 2.0b 0 unregistered evaluation copy kmail 2.95d w-net hq hal9k.ann-arbor.mi.us +1 313 663 4173 or 3959"

b'my western digital also have three set of pin on the back i be use it with another hard drive a well and the setting for the jumper be write right on the circuit board of the wd drive ... ... ma sl well i figure out how the jumper go now i have quite a different problem that have me perplexed like you know i have both drive work the c system format and all of my hardware instal only problem be that during the boot up sequence the computer do not want to pas up look for a system on the a drive reinitialization all go fine and the bios seem to be configure to what be necessary all the drive test work but when the thing come back around to the a drive and there be no disk present it just spin if you insert a disk into drive a with a system however it work fine and boot up ie how instal all my software any additional help on this will be most welcome ... swood'
b'we have plenty of computer lab where the computer be left on all the time i see any shorter lifespan than the one we have in the office which do get turn off at the end of the day in fact some of the computer in the lab have outlive some of the same one in the office but it go both way so conclude anything'
b'how can one tell which prong of your basic chip be number 20 i realize there be a chunk of the chip miss so that one can orient it correctly so use that hole a a guide how can i count the prong of the chip to find 20 please help'
b"i have this problem some time ago some bioses do not automatically install com3 or com4 in the port table program like most modem program which write directly to the port work fine but anything that us a bios call fails find a bb or ftp site where you can get a copy of port finder put '' device=pf.sys '' in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat this little program will locate all exist port and make sure the bios table be update it work great pf will also let you swap port and such also if that be of any value to you"
b'hi all this be my first post so be gentle ... i have a zenith external floppy which have a db25 connector and like to use it with my sharp and toshiba laptop which also take a db25 for their ext floppy but it work i have the pinouts for the zenith and would like to make adapter so i can use it do anyone have pinouts for these or other manufacturer db25 ext floppy connector i would greatly appreciate this info either by e-mail or fax thanks very much jeff aka flyboy coyote.trw.com fax 310 882-8800'
b'just take delivery of a 66mhz 486 dx2 machine and very nice it be too one query the landmark speed when turbo be on be 230 or something mhz thats not the problem the problem be the speed when turbo be off it 7 mhz the equivalent in car term be have a nice porsche with a button that turn it into a skateboard do anyone have a clue a to what determines the relative performance of turbo v non-turbo i would like to set it to give a landmark speed of about 30 or 40 mhz with turbo off cheer'
b'i believe you be right both scsi and scsi-2 support 8 device on the bus normally that would be the host controller and 7 target each of which may have up to 8 logical unit luns'
b"stuff delete there be two 'problems 1 the bios tod routine which update the bios clock us only 1 bit for day increment so a second wrap of the clock past midnight will get lose if no one call the bios to read the clock in the meantime and 2 the bios reset the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date' call from anybody after the wrap indicator have be set so unless the first bios 'get date call after midnight be do by the do 'kernel which be the only part of do which know how to increment the date the day wrap indication be normally lose my guess be that kevin 's 'menu system us bios call to read the clock in order to display the time and be hence the entity which cause the day wrap indication to get lose even if the 'menu system 'notices the day 'wrap which i think be indicate by a non-zero value in al there really any particularly good way to tell do about it so that do can update the day the menu system 'should use do call to get the time which would cause the do 'kernel to do the bios call and the wrap indicator would hence be process properly possibly though the 'menu system easily use do call for time because do be not reentrant and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu system be 'inside some other do call"

b"this may be the dumbest question of the year but be there a way to 'piggyback or expand a 6-slot motherboard all 16-bit to get the usual 8 my case have slot for 8 and like to get a scanner but with all my other card already max 'd out hop that a simple solution exists e.g an adapter that turn not sure if this will work but how about use one of those 't expanders use in the low-profile case they allow 3-5 slot stagger on either side of the card you can install it in the last slot and then probably have 2 or 3 sideways slot this be actually how it be do in the low profile case a standard motherboard the 't connector in one slot and the expansion card plug into the 't i guess you could do this at each end of the slot 1 8 to add even more the 't connector be simply track with slot on them no electronics on it the only downside your case close but for a homebrew system that may not be a problem know about performance though i 'll leave that discussion to the engineer"

b"then complain maybe it you that scsi be so expensive on pc 's because all have until a year or two ago be the isa bus ie no one buy scsi for isa because isa be slow be you say that scsi on an isa bus be not an automatic winner when compare to ide i get different transfer rate out of my ide when i change my isa bus speed ide be just a variant of the old ibm- mfm at controller at least how it look from a software point of view it be never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platform be there any argument that ide can or transfer data from the ide drive at least a fast a the drive be able to provide the data be scsi version of ide drive able to deliver high sustain transfer rate to their scsi interface because of a high rpm platter different arrangement of head etc if data be go from one drive to another and if scsi have the ability to perform that transfer without the data have to go through the cpu or main memory then yes that be the optimal way to do it a far a i know ide do that but when the cpu want data from both drive data to be store in main memory be you say that scsi can grab data from both drive at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time work off 1 irq and 1 dma channel on an isa or whatever bus a friend of mine just get a maxtor 245 meg ide drive for 320 245 million byte or 234 mega-bytes with the basic 20 interface he get close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20. do your figure include a few hundred for scsi driver so say that scsi would have be the default interface type consider that the vast majority of pc 's have cd-rom drive or tape backup or etc that most pc 's only have or have 1 hard drive and run do that scsi hard drive cost a lot more than mfm or rll drive at the time and how common be scsi drive under 80 meg 4 to 10 year ago there 's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevent scsi from become the connection medium of choice but on that point be it faster this be what all this be about do you get more performance for the money for all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system regardless of the o will the scsi choice really give them more performance than ide true but expandibility can also start on the bus which mean the option be there for cd-rom drive or tape backup that run off their own card no argument this be always held up to the first time scsi buyer a the best reason but how many scsi device will the first time scsi buyer eventually acquire again do it make sense to go scsi for a single hard drive system with all the posting on the scsi i or ii spec be you really sure that pc and apple scsi hard drive be compatible and even if they be be the data accessible from either machine ie be there no formatting/ partition or file table difference be it really plug n'play so the c drive on the connor becomes a logical d drive to do be this really a problem after have two ide drive in my system for temporary file transfer i have never see any difference when switch between drive nor have i ever see any difference when transfer file between drive or to/from the same drive that be nice a long a the power supply can keep up i do believe that there be the possibility for up to 4 ide drive on a pc"

sr.hp.com ***** window 3.1 enhance mode the window 3.1 install program should automatically configure do and window for use with the adaptec 1542. however just in case something go wrong go to describe some of the change need to get window 3.1 work with the 1542. also you may have notice that instal window 3.1 make your pc run much slow even when not run window method of speed it up be discuss in the section call `` window 3.1 run slowly '' msdos configuration the window install program add the smartdrive disk cache to your config.sys and autoexec.bat file if you follow the instruction notice that need to use double-buffering with smartdrive this be the default setup also notice that your system run much much slow -- in both window *and* msdos see the section call `` window 3.1 run slowly '' for some way of speed your system up window configuration to get the adaptec 1542 to work with window make sure that the '' 388enh '' section of the system.ini file contains the entry virtualhdirq=off i believe that the window install program automatically add this entry to system.ini but not sure if this work for you you might want to try add some more line virtualhdirq=off systemrombreakpoint=false emmexclude=a000-cfff you probably need the above line though the '' systemrombreakpoint '' entry be use to enable support for memory manager like qemm/386max only need if you use such program window 3.1 run slowly once you do get window 3.1 run with the 1542 chance be that your system be run much slow than before if not probably because 1. you happen to be use aspi4dos.sys version 3.1 in your config.sys file congratulation -- this appear to be a win solution 2. you be very lucky whether your luck will hold out remains to be see ... if your system be run much slow than before this be almost definitely cause by smartdrive with double-buffering accord to the window documentation and the microsoft technical note q81808 `` smartdrive double buffering require with aspi4dos.sys '' you must use smartdrive with double-buffering enable while this work it really slows down your pc i once estimate that this slow my pc down by a factor of 5 five a i consider this unacceptable i look for other solution unfortunately you can not just disable double-buffering if you do window 3.1 in enhance mode will not work and you might even destroy the content of your hard disk by try to run window 3.1. what you can do be one of the follow 1. use other driver that provide double-buffering it be my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive be cause either by horribly inefficient double-buffering or by a bug in smartdrive 2. use a driver that provide `` vd '' service `` vd '' stand for '' virtual dma service '' this be a standard which be support by window 3.1 that allows bus-mastering disk controller like the 1542 to work with window after trash my hard disk countless time i found the follow solution none of which require use smartdrive note however that i be now get occasional parity error which be probably *not* cause by these solution but might be -- see below while the follow do not require smartdrive use some kind of disk cache utility be strongly recommend a this make window run much much faster 1. if you do not have the aspi4dos.sys driver or you do not need aspi function for control a cdrom tape drive more than two physical hard disk etc you can add the scsiha.sys driver to your config.sys file e.g driver=c \\scsiha.sys /v386 window need the `` /v386 '' option this driver must be load into low memory it can not be load into high memory and it occupies about 16-20k a of november 1992 the scsiha.sys driver could be obtain from the adaptec bb at 408 -945-7727 hopefully still there 2. if you need aspi function and have the aspi4dos.sys driver version 3.0 or 3.0a you can use both the aspi4dos.sys and scsiha.sys driver in your config.sys file e.g driver=c \\aspi4dos.sys driver=c \\scsiha.sys /v386 amazingly enough the scsiha.sys driver can also be load high assume you have do 5.0 i would have thought that this would crash my system but it i ask adaptec 's technical support about this and they say that load scsiha.sys high should be fine a long a aspi4dos.sys be load low on my system not use scsiha.sys with aspi4dos 3.0a would occasionally cause window 3.1 to crash upon restart or exit window with the additional result of a corrupt disk some of my c \\windows\\*.grp file would be corrupt for me these crash usually occur while make a different program from progman.exe the default window shell and vice-versa this be the reason scsiha.sys may be necessary i have absolutely no idea if scsiha.sys be necessary with version of aspi4dos earlier than 3.0. note that many people can use aspi4dos 3.0 or 3.0a without scsiha.sys they do not seem to have any problem at all i consider these people lucky others like me have have all sort of problem 3. in my opinion the best but not necessarily the easy solution be to upgrade to aspi4dos 3.1. the scsiha.sys driver be no longer need unfortunately while you could get previous aspi4dos upgrade from the adaptec bb the aspi4dos 3.1 driver be not available from the adaptec bb a far a i know there be only three way to get a copy you can buy the new a of november 1992 adaptec ez scsi driver kit which supposedly include aspi4dos 3.1 a well a other driver such a cdrom driver i believe the list price be around 75 if you already have a copy of an old version of aspi4dos you can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for around 30 a copy of aspi4dos 3.1 be include in central point pc tool 8.0 for msdos note that the documentation and driver be store in different directory note far that only aspi4dos be include the cdrom driver and driver to support more than two hard disk be not include this be where i obtain my copy of aspi4dos 3.1. note however that i be now get occasional parity error with window in all probability defective hardware in my pc be cause this a i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above solution however because these parity error occur only during disk access there be a very small but definite possibility that the parity error be driver-related for example change the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfer might cause this run various memory test for hour at a time and these test have found no problem this problem be probably cause by memory with marginal timing requirement which cause parity error during disk transfer this be why the memory test find any problem -- the problem show up only under disk i/o however mention this just in case it a hardware problem ***** floppy-controller-based tape backup device there be two possible problem with use the adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device such a the colorado memory system jumbo 250 1. tape backups/restores can take a very long time the tape drive constantly start stop start stop etc 2. tape operation may be erratic or encounter too many tape error this problem might be cause by defective hardware on my 1542. however heard of other people have similar problem and so mention this just in case it be not a hardware problem on my 1542 tape backups/restores take a long time if you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device you may have to adjust the adaptec 1540/1542 `` bus on/off timing '' for best result when use the tape drive normally while do a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously run with only an occasional pause however the default bus timing on the adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few second this cause needle wear to the tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape head be clean this also cause the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary the problem here be that these tape backup use the floppy dma to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive and the adaptec us dma to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk the floppy dma need to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive be not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma the tape drive stop rewinds a bit and restarts once enough data be eventually fed to it the default bus timing on the adaptec which be really dma timing be '' too large '' for example when a backup be do data have to be transfer from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape because the default timing on the adaptec `` hog '' the memory too much too much time be spent transfer data from a hard disk to memory not enough time be spent transfer data from memory to the tape drive a a result the tape drive constantly start and stop because data be not fed to it quickly enough the solution be to change the adaptec 's bus on/off timing the default factory set be 11 microsecond on and 5 microsecond off the `` bus on '' timing need to be lower to 2-4 microsecond this can be do in one of two way if you have aspi4dos you can use the `` /n '' option for example i use a `` bus on '' timing of 4 microsecond which mean that i use the follow line in my config.sys file device=c \\aspi4dos.sys /n4 note that there be no space between the `` /n '' and the `` 4 '' if you have aspi4dos your only recourse be to try to find a program call `` setscsi.exe '' which be very difficult to find the reason be that adaptec for reason of their own do not seem to want this widely distribute i once ask someone who work for adaptec and they ask me to not upload it anywhere if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet you could try use archie to hunt down a copy i believe that there be a couple of site that have it if you do find a copy you run it like so setscsi -n:4 this adjusts the `` bus on '' timing to 4 microsecond run setscsi.exe without any argument reset the bus timing back to the factory default note that it seem that you can not use setscsi.exe if you use aspi4dos setscsi.exe crashed my system if aspi4dos be load i could use setscsi.exe with scsiha.sys however do not low the `` bus on '' timing below 2 microsecond or increase it above 11 microsecond if you low it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slow for me 4 microsecond work fine this value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little once lower the `` bus on '' timing tape backup and restores should run faster also do not experiment with the bus on/off time with the other option that i have intentionally not described unless you know what you be do bad combination can cause parity error and bad by starve memory refresh a program call bustifix.exe exists on the adaptec bb unless this have be upgraded since i last checked which have be a while this be a self-extracting archive contain a batch file and a couple of other file this batch file be suppose to allow one to set the bus on/off time for the 1540/1542 and others however when i try run this program with my 1542a my system crashed at the time i be run scsiha.sys and i check to see if there be a conflict with it maybe this old program work only with the 1542b although the doc say that it work with the 1542a erratic tape operation or too many tape error this `` problem '' may or may not exist although it exist on my system a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it however heard of other people have similar problem and so mention this just in case it a hardware problem just on my 1542. symptom of this `` problem '' which persists even after cleaning the tape head 1. backing up to tape encounter `` unusable sector detect '' error result in an aborted tape backup 2. tape backup work but the tape compare fails 3. the tape drive start stop start stop etc much too often unlike the above-mentioned problem `` tape backups/restores take a long time '' where the tape drive start and stop every few second this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 second or so 4. fastback plus 3.1 do not find/see any tape backup device other program like central point backup and the cm jumbo software assume that you have a cm jumbo 250 tape drive can find/see the tape drive but fastback plus 3.1 can not 5. too many tape read error although i do not know what be cause this problem i discover that use a different floppy controller solves it a few month ago i upgraded my motherboard which contain an integrate floppy controller a i already have a floppy controller on the 1542 i initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller after a while i decide to try disable the 1542 floppy controller and use the one on the motherboard when i do this the tape drive a cm jumbo 250 reliability increase dramatically and fastback plus 3.1 be suddenly able to find and use the tape drive i know if this be cause by a hardware problem on my 1542. on the one hand the floppy drive work great when they be attach to the 1542 which seem to say that there be nothing wrong with the 1542. on the other hand the tape drive work well attach to the 1542 floppy controller but it do work when attach to a different controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542. i do change floppy drive cable and so it be conceivable that the problem be in the cable i know what the cause really be however if have similar problem you might want to consider try a new floppy controller ***** sound card many popular sound card can play or record digitize sound and this be typically do use dma like the tape drive dma the adaptec 's dma can conflict with the sound card dma unlike that of the tape dma this `` conflict '' usually manifest itself a a parity error your system crash with a parity error message what happens be that data be be transfer so quickly by the sound card and the adaptec memory refresh can not occur quickly enough which cause a parity error usually get a parity error mean that there be a hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity error be not a symptom of bad hardware found that such parity error typically occur while record digitize sound and the chance of such error increase a you increase the record fidelity e.g. high sample rate record in stereo record use 16-bits instead of 8 etc. like the tape drive solution the solution here be to low the adaptec 's `` bus on '' timing see the section on tape drive for information on how this be do note however that this may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity error the software use to record digitize sound can greatly affect this problem i.e. some software be inefficient disk cache the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this ***** miscellaneous info this section contains miscellaneous hint tip and rumor much of it be merely information that heard or read about and have not verify i believe that the follow information be correct but not sure use it at your own risk with qemm 6.00 6.01 and 6.02 you need to specify the `` db= '' parameter e.g. `` db=2 '' unless you be use the aspi4dos driver if you qemm will crash/hang at bootup although the qemm manual mention this the install program do not seem to detect that a 1542 be present and automatically add this option to the qemm command line at least this occur with the qemm 6.00 install program -- i test any other version earlier version of qemm probably need this parameter but not sure never use a version earlier than 6.00 if you use aspi4dos you do not need to give qemm the `` db= '' parameter some or all version of the 1542 do not support hard disk over one gigabyte in size to support hard disk with capacity over 1gb you need to get a new rom bios from adaptec not sure if this be still true of the late 1542bs be sell by adaptec to connect a cdrom drive to the 1542 you need a scsi cdrom drive and some driver note that some cdrom drive have proprietary interface non-scsi these drive can not be use with the 1542. you have three choice for cdrom driver i have no idea how well the follow solution work or even if they work -- the follow be secondhand information 1. you can buy adaptec 's ez scsi driver package which list for something like 75 if you already have old adaptec driver you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around 30 contact adaptec for detail the ez scsi package supposedly contains everything that you need 2. you can buy the corelscsi driver package which be make by the same people that make coreldraw this package contains cdrom driver scsi tape driver worm driver etc i do not know the list price but see this package sell for around 80- 90 note that corelscsi do not come with the aspi4dos driver which be need if you do not already have aspi4dos you may be well off get adaptec 's ez scsi instead 3 this method be obsolete a the follow driver have be obsoleted by adaptec 's ez scsi kit but mention it in case someone already have these driver you can use the driver in the adaptec asw-1410 kit aspi4dos and the asw-410 kit aspi cdrom driver you will have to get a copy of mscdex.exe a high-level cdrom driver if it be not include in the asw-410 kit but this be available from several bulletin board to use a scsi tape drive with the 1542 you need software that know how to talk to a scsi tape drive software that heard about be again like the above section on cdrom drive i have no idea how well the follow solution work or even if they work -- the follow be secondhand information 1. central point pc tool 8.0 for msdos supposedly support a large number of scsi tape drive it come with scsi driver aspi4dos 3.1 a well a central point backup 2. the corelscsi driver package contains a scsi tape backup program see the above section on cdrom drive for more detail however note that corelscsi do not come with but require aspi4dos see advertisement that sell the 1542 in three configuration 1 1542 scsi controller with hard disk rom bios 2 1542 scsi controller w/bios and adaptec aspi driver 3 1542 scsi controller w/bios adaptec aspi driver and corelscsi drivers/programs i imagine that adaptec now sell the 1542 in a fourth configuration 4 1542 scsi controller w/bios and ez scsi driver include aspi driver those people who use unix might be interested in a version of gnu tar for msdos that talk to a scsi tape drive via the aspi4dos driver you need this driver before you can use this program never use this version of gnu tar but heard that it work i know how well though if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror site pd1 msdos.dskutl aspibin.zip 67841 920131 gnu tar for scsi tape drive adaptec 154xx aspipat.zip 21206 920131 patch for aspibin relative to gnu tar 1.10 aspisrc.zip 221370 920131 src for gnu tar for scsi tape adaptec ctrlr i have no idea if a copy can be found on compuserve unixforum might have it if any forum do a far a msdos be concerned the 1542a and the 1542b controller be the same with msdos the 1542a should work a well a the 1542b however the hardware for these two board be not 100 identical and there be at least one non-msdos program that initially do not work with a 1542a but do work with a 1542b bsd386 -- a 386 version of bsd unix in case anyone 's curious here 's an edit copy of my config.sys file files=40 buffers=40 break=on stacks=10,256 device=c \\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d

b'do it do it to all tape be the two tape that it unwound of the same type from the same batch the reason i ask be that i bought some generic tape that do this and found that the tape marker be not fully punch out and have close the little marker hole it be only on a few tape of a set do you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reel if you have not yet open it up by remove the two screw on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base a you be pull the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to a you be do it look for a couple of little hole in the tape these be the marker hole which let the tape drive know when it be at the end of the tape the hole be space a couple of inch apart my best guess be that the drive find the first marker and then stop on the second marker anyhow if the tape have the hole then check to see if the mirror on the tape be clean the function of the mirror be to detect the marker hole the tape drive shine a light at the mirror and have a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out when the hole go by the pickup detects the light that be allow to pas and it know when to stop if the mirror be dirty or out of alighment unlikely since it be make into the case you might have a problem detect the end of the tape if the tape drive do it on all tape and the tape all look good then either the pickup or the lead of the sensor system have fail or be dirty if you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the r/w head assembly if it look clean and nothing be in it way then the drive may need to be service it be possible that the lead be burn out or the sensor be out if it be still in warranty you might be able to send it back to cm for repair -- scott hiles while relay.nswc.navy.mil'

b"point of view why do scsi have an advantage when it come to multi- task data be data and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster do it have a well cache system i thought scsi be good at manage a data bus when multiple device be attach if we be only talk about a single drive explain why scsi be inherently faster at manage data from a hard drive ide integrate device electronics currently the most common standard and be mainly use for medium size drive can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer ~5mb/s max why you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi spec till blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what 's the point who say isa be necessary eisa or vlb be the only interface worth invest thousand of dollar e.g a new pc 's worth of money in who say ide be limited to 5 megs/sec what about vlb-ide do anyone know how they perform you read to carefully vlb-ide us the same connection mechanism a standard ide if transfer rate be limited by ide whether interfaced to isa eisa or vlb matter not so at it low set scsi-2 interface in asynchronous scsi-1 mode average the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode in full scsi-2 mode it blow poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can a implimented on what system on mine for one thing scsi blow ide out of the water hand down if ide have well throughput why it use on workstation and file server the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rate and that be where the bottleneck and cost of scsi-2 come from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the scsi-2 through put give the original question scsi use only a a single hard drive controller be it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least 5 maybe 10 megs/sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what do a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec scsi drive cost no the nice thing -- on a multitasking o scsi can use both drive at once get unix load on one of my pc along with windogs and the o can only use one of the two ide drive at one time pretty ugly i just bought at quantum 240 for my mac at home i paid 369 for it i see ide drive cheaper the original cga cart back in '84 be 300 i think the original ega card or pga be 800 scsi have stood relatively alone in not come down in price mainly because talk about pc 's and not sun 's or sparc or sgi or name your favorite unix workstation that be after million of pc buying decision over the year scsi have have plenty of time to come down in price no actually talk about scsi be expensive simply because nobody do a common interface for the pc if they have a common read easily implement method of add scsi to a pc like a in a sun or mac then find scsi the connection medium of choice i argue that the scsi standard make for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically well than ide on an isa bus when it come to multi-tasking o 's when manage data from a single scsi hard drive on a single drive scsi be more expensive but you bought your pc for expandibility so want to add more drive or whatever the follow be why i find scsi intrinsically well than ide a partial list 1. you can add many different type of device and access them concurrently 2. a scsi device work on many different machine i have a mac and a pc at home and move hard drive between them be very nice with scsi -- hook them up and away they go 3. scsi device work together well than ide device for instance recently i add an old connor 100 meg ide to a maxtor 212 meg ide the connor *must* be setup a the slave it will work no other way on scsi you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it go 4. i have a problem with ide 's mutual exclusion i notice that the time it take to switch from access drive c to drive d be quite long a compare to the time it take to switch from drive c to d on a scsi system under a multitasking o this be very noticable a many thing can be go on at once one neat thing that notice lately a fringe benefit have be the ability to add old almost dead drive a storage on a scsi system with little problem -- get a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drive that add to my pc now get the interface full but it do allow me to have 4 20 meg drive 1 240 meg drive 1 tape drive and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card simply put scsi be handier than ide no mysterious jumper to figure out greg"

ny cc ah finally a question i can answer i mess with this old stuff alot kinda fun 8 first problem i can forsee be that the st-251 will not be compadible with that wd card unless it have the right bios rom check the number on it it should be the only non-smt chip on the board slightly below center and left the bios should read either 62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2 if the last 3 digit be 013 you get problem look right w5 and w7 be factory jumped with a trace between pin 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address look right art delete i notice you left out the s1 jumper table setting those be what control what drive the controller think it have if you have the 62-000042-015 rom set it like this 5 open 6 open 7 open 8 open 4 close 3 close 2 open 1 open note those be how wd run the number on the jumper block top to bottom 's represent the jumper pin pin 3,4 and 8 select the first drive set drive 0 and pin 1,2 and 7 select the second drive drive 1 if you have the 62-000094 rom a auto-config and i 'll have to look up how to do it ... i have the big book right here see above you might have problem if the s1 jumper be not right also at the risk of be insult make sure the cable be on right and good 8 on the jumper on the 251 try move it to the opposite side of the drive one or the other the narrow data cable go to j2 thrown it on j3 a few time and bang my head for a day ... .. dunno ibm rom have to be later than 10/27/82 a quick way to check be to boot do and run debug enter -d f000 fff5 fffc the be the debug prompt this will return the rom date if of any use if i oversimplify any of the above i appologize just hard to know what caliber of person talk to 8 -- bob valentine -- -- ravalent mailbox.syr.edu -- from chpp unitrix.utr.ac.za mon apr 5 06:33:46 1993

b'with a sound card on interrupt 5 two serial port one for modem on i4 one for miracle piano on i3 and a printer port on i7 i have run out of low interrupt what i would like be a mouse port with an interrupt of 10 11 or 12 which ever interrupt the ps/2 mouse port us in in isa i486 computer i call technical support of microsoft logitech ati checked what interrupt the mouse port on the ati video card can use and they all say the only interrupt possible on these card be one low than 7. do anyone know of any board for an isa bus which will allow a mouse port or even a serial port with high interrupt'
b"why you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi spec till blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what 's the point who say ide be limited to 5 megs/sec what about vlb-ide do anyone know how they perform a implimented on what system give the original question scsi use only a a single hard drive controller be it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least 5 maybe 10 megs/sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what do a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec scsi drive cost the original cga cart back in '84 be 300 i think the original ega card or pga be 800 scsi have stood relatively alone in not come down in price mainly because talk about pc 's and not sun 's or sparc or sgi or name your favorite unix workstation that be after million of pc buying decision over the year scsi have have plenty of time to come down in price"
b"the last time i be in microprocessor lab be in 1980 use z-80 so i know a lot of buzz term in pc hardware now i need to purchase a 486 help me to ask the right question motherboard i need 486-33 with 8 mb ram with additonal slot for 8 more mb i would like to get two vesa local bus one for video not sure what be i go to do with the other it must be able to run unix what be other question that i should ask to ensure get a quality stuff what be other important feature monitor i want a 14 '' non interlaced svga but not sure about what brand to get i afford nec or sony what brand should i consider acer touch what else should i ask video card i would like to run framemaker so i need a fast video card be western digital worth the 20 over cirrus logic do i need more than 1m of v-ram one company want 50 more for a local bus video card be this normal hard drive segate western digital conner all have the same price which one be more liable which one have well performace case/power supply give the choise of desktop and minitower which one be well what be the adequate power supply be cool a general problem or a non-issue what feature should i ask for do i miss anything i be sure that there be a lot of semi-pc-literates reading this group your help be greatly appreciate"
b"greeting please forgive me if this be faq if there be source on this kind of info please let me know i just get a 286 station around 21*16.5*7 in dimension and i be think about upgrade it to a 486 or 386. the station have a power supply two floppy disk drive and the big case i have sony 1304 monitor syquest drive mac and maybe a cd-rom reader mac for it here be the question i have so far 1 be there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that i could use the case 2 the original owener have the controller for floppy drive and hard disk remove can i use them to control these device under 486 how much do i have to pay for a new controller if the old one work 3 how can i make syquest scsi and cd-rom scsi work on this station i heard that there be a cheap sound board that have scsi controller built-in what 's quality of this board how much usually do a scsi control cost be there any ftp site that have syquest driver or cd-rom driver for the pc if i can have everything hooked up ok 4 what i want be a 486 motherboard a sound board to make it a mpc- quality station how much would it cost to do that be it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station btw i need to buy a keyboard for it too any input be welcome thank you"
b"b i be interested in get the pulse of this group regard b extend operation of my g2k 486-33v with the cover remove b from the enclosure there be a of reason i be consider b this include quick access to jumper during complex i/o card b setup b my concern be that without a complete enclosure to direct the b cool flow of air from the fan `` hot spot '' may develop on my b motherboard or elsewhere if you have an adequate supply of air move over the system most office or home have positive ventilation you can generally run a system without the cover for extend period without a problem talk about completely remove the cover not just leave the slot uncovered however the big reason you have a cover to begin with be rf sheilding operating a system without the full cover may create problem with other equipment such a your neighbor 's tv or ham radio station very much a no-no in the eye of the law slmr 2.1a remember only tool not a way of life"
