b"ideology also split give more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance so do you also oppose all ideology i think your argument be an argument against religion at all but just point out the weakness of human nature i would like a reference if you have get one for this be news to me one must approach the qur'an with intelligence any think approach to the qur'an can not but interpret the above verse and others like it that woman and men be spiritual equal i think that the above verse do clearly imply that woman have soul do it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven or to have a great reward understood to be in the after-life i think the usual answer would be no -- in which case the part say `` for them have god prepared forgiveness and a great reward '' say they have soul if it make sense to say that thing without soul can be forgiven then i have no idea _what_ a soul be a for your say that the quote above may not be give a high priority in all interpretation any think approach to the qur'an have to give all verse of the qur'an equal priority that be because accord to muslim belief the _whole_ qur'an be the revelation of god -- in fact deny the truth of any part of the qur'an be sufficient to be consider a disbeliever in islam look any approach to the qur'an must be do with intelligence and thought it be in this fashion that one can try to understand the quran 's message in a book of finite length it can not explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through it teaching it can guide you i think however that woman be the spiritual equal of men be clearly and unambiguously imply in the above verse and that since woman can clearly be `` forgiven '' and `` reward '' they _must_ have soul from the above verse let 's try to understand what the qur'an be try to teach rather than try to see how many way it can be misinterpret by ignore this passage or that passage the misinterpretation of the qur'an base on ignore this verse or that verse be infinite but the interpretation fully consistent be more limited let 's try to discus these interpretation consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that be just show how people can try to twist islam for their own end -- something i do not deny -- but provide no reflection on the true teaching of islam whatsoever"

b"i assume you be post to encourage comment how much history have tony campello read not much it seem it be good to hear that there be a few reasonable christian about if only those christian `` scientist '' would take note in australia there be a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientist who believe that every single event in the bible be exactly true and that there be a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by use the law of physic for example there be a few chap who be try to prove that the age of the universe be 6000 year old and that the error in conventional calculation be the result of the fact that the speed light have be rapidly decay over the year and this have not be account for or of course that he never exist and the bible be a story and be never intend to become a manifesto for a billion people do tony follow that one up million of people have `` die for a lie '' this point be difficult to substantiate since it be not well define a great many religious argument work in that way but consider the many aztec warrior who sacrifice themselves to their god in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invader the list be endless the aztec lose btw that be perfectly reasonable but it be not ground for me or anyone to become a christian more to the point it do not add weight to the claim that jesus be the `` real thing '' have you ever see a documentary about the rise of nazi germany more to the point do tony mention this one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleague fool or illogical men their support of hitler be base i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principle obviously my argument be invalid if tony thought that hitler be sane ... hmmm ... i think his argument warrant the use of a `` therefore ... '' this be unfortunately what alot of religious discussion i have have with people result in quote the bible the only reasonable way i think people can look at the bible be to treat the story a some sort of metaphorical representation of the message that the author be try to present if someone try to interpret part of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sort of shit tony 's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the event described in the bible take place but to convince someone who think the bible be total fiction that jesus be real by quote the book be totally pointless for example in mathematics you can not say `` a be equal to b because a be equal to b '' that would possibly explain why there have so many people be kill in religious war and why there be hundred of different version all claim to be correct it i think if you post this part to alt.religion you would get more flame than here i have never really understood why the emotional sentiment of a stranger should be of interest to other people someone famous say that there two evil in life polititians and church one rule by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead if i be press i could probably find the exact quotation"

b"true at first the news medium seem entrance by all the new gizmo the military be use not to mention the taped video transmission from the missile a they zeroed in on their target but later and especially after the bunker full of civilian be hit they change their tone it seem to me that they have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and be maim in warfare like they be only pro-gulf-war a long a it be `` nice and clean '' smart missile drop in on military hq but not when picture of dead die and maim civilian start crop up what naive hypocrite discussion about blanket-bombing and a-bomb delete ^^^^^^^^^ i should have say here `` militarily justified '' it seem from your comment below that you understood this a meaning `` morally justified '' i apologize i have often wonder about this always thought that the first bomb should have be drop on japan 's island fortress of truk a good inpenatrable military target the second bomb could 've be held back for use on an industrial center if need be but i digress yes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japan be seriously consider surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderate and reject the us's ulimatum therefore the second bomb be drop most unfortunate imo i regret the fact that sometimes military decision have to be make which affect the life of innocent people but i do regret the circumstance which make those decision necessary and i regret the suffer cause by those decision ... actually it be the fact that both situation exist that prompt u and allied action if some back-water country take over some other back-water country we probably intervene not that we care but we be the world 's policman or if a coup have occur in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still have act because there would not have be the imminent danger perceive to saudi arabia but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west 's oil interest cause u to take action ... not set up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative be to allow hussein to keep kuwait diplomatic alternative include sanction be ineffective well in a sense yes they probably have no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to they suffer along with the rest why do this bother you so much the world be full of evil and circumstance be not perfect many innocent suffer due to the wrongful action of others it it regretable but the-way-it-is there be no perfect solution ... probably because not the savior of the world we police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another nor be we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other place tell me how we could stop them and i 'll support it i for one do not agree with the present u policy of `` suck up to them '' a you put it i agree that it be deplorable be they or be they suppose to reflect the population of the locale where the trial be held normally this be where the crime be commit unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue be in order not an expert on california law or even u law but it seem that this be the way the system be set up you can criticize the system but let 's not have unfounded allegation of racial prejudice thrown around no not at all the point be that the fact that there be no black on the first jury and that rodney king be black be totally irrelevant german perhaps `` peer '' mean `` those who do the same thing '' like have murderer judge murderer it mean `` have people from the same station in life '' presumably because they be in a well position to understand the defendent 's motivation s ok grant however you be use this reason a part of *your* logical argument in this discussion this be not a court of law the medium be not totally monolithic even though there be a prevail liberal bias program such a the macneil-lehrer news hour try to give a balance and fair reporting of the news there be even conservative source out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw i never use the word `` conspiracy '' i accept without *far* more evidence theory that there be some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempt to take over all news source hardly i say that a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end be just unfortunately we live in a perfect world and there be no perfect solution if one be go to resist tyranny then innocent people on both side be go to suffer and die i say it be ok -- it be unfortunate but sometimes necessary i would agree that it be evil in the sense that it cause much pain and suffer not so sure that it be unnecessary a you say that conclusion can only be arrive at by evaluate all the factor involve and perhaps it *was* unnecessary a let 's say we now know that mean that those who have to make the decision to bomb see it a be necessary rarely can one have full know of the consequence of an action before make a decision at the time it may have seem necessary enough to go ahead with it but assume that i feel the bombing be *morally* justified -- i i just condemn those who have to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstance you certainly be not in such a position if you be a moral relativist i a an absolutist be in a position to judge but i defer judgment wrong they be neither moral then nor now they seem necessary to those make the decision to bring a quick end to the war i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramification of that and i be prepared to do so i believe that you can make the same claim and btw the reason i brought up the blanket-bombing in germany be because you be bemoan the iraqi civilian casualty a be '' so deplorable '' yet blanket bombing be institute because bombing accurate enough to hit industrial/military target in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing be the norm so the point be why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualty that result *in spite of* precision bombing when so many more civilian proportionately and quantitatively die under the blanket bombing in ww2 even with precision bombing mistake happen and some civilian suffer but less civilian suffer in this war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilian go about their life with minimal interference from the allied air raid the story of `` hundred of thousand '' of iraqi civilian dead be just plain bunk yes bunk the u lose 230,000 serviceman in ww2 over four year and the majority of them be directly involve in fight but we be expect to swallow that `` hundred of thousand '' of *civilian* iraqi die in a war last about 2 month and with the ally use the most precise bomb ever create at that what hogwash if `` hundred of thousand '' of iraqi civilian die it be due to action hussein take on his own people not due to the allied bombing regard"

b"yes this be also my understand of the majority of islamic law however i believe there be also certain legal ruling which in all five school of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari can be level against muslim or non-muslims both within and outside dar-al-islam i do not know if apostasy when accompany by active persistent and open hostility to islam fall into this category of the law i do know that historically apostasy have very rarely be punish at all let alone by the death penalty my understand be that khomeini 's ruling be not base on the law of apostasy alone it be well know that rushdie be an apostate long before he write the offend novel and certainly there be no precedent in the qur'an hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantly level death penalty for apostasy i believe the charge level against rushdie be that of `` fasad '' this ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carry out by individual the reward be not offer by khomeini but by individual within iran i would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember be level at the author and all those who assist in the publication of the book however the charge of `` fasad '' can encompass a number of lesser charge i remember that when diplomatic relation broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa iran stress that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation be two preliminary condition for resolve the '' crisis '' but you be correct to point out that ban the book be not the main thrust behind the fatwa islamic charge such a fasad be level at people not book the rushdie situation be follow in iran for several month before the issuance of the fatwa rushdie go on a medium blitz present himself a a lone knight guard the sacred value of secular democracy and mock the foolish concern of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious belief a sacred fan the flame and milk the controversy to boost his image and push the book he be everywhere in the medium then muslim demonstrator in several country be kill while protest against the book rushdie appear momentarily concerned then climbed back on his medium horse to once again attack the muslim and defend his sacred right it be at this point that the fatwa on `` fasad '' be issue the fatwa be level at the person of rushdie any action of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of it own but by the will of the author and the publisher the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his action a well the crime be certainly a crime in progress at many level and be be played out and played up in the the full view of the medium"

b"what do you mean by omnipotent here do you mean by `` omnipotent '' that god should be able to do anything/everything this creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which be effectively useless to be descriptive omnipotence must mean `` be all-powerful '' and not `` be able to do anything/everything '' let me illustrate by analogy suppose the united state be the only nuclear power on earth suppose far that the u military could not effectively be counter by any nation or group of nation the u have the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten thing out a the leader of the u see fit the u would be militarily `` omnipotent '' but suppose far that the u hold to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfere in the internal affair of any nation such a the current civil war in the former yugoslavian state technically in this scenario the u would have the power to unilaterally go into yugoslavia and straighten out the mess but effectively the u could not intervene without violate it own policy of non-interference if the policy of non-interference be held to strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would ever be violate effectively the u would be limited in what it could actually do although it have the power to do `` whatever it want '' the u would simply `` never want to interfere '' for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of it leader give such an inviolate non-interference policy god be effectively limited in the same sense he be all powerful but he can not use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what he himself be i hope this help to clear up some of the misunderstand concern omnipotence regard"

b"archive-name atheism/introduction alt-atheism-archive-name introduction last-modified 5 april 1993 version 1.2 -- -- -begin pgp sign message -- -- an introduction to atheism by mathew mathew mantis.co.uk this article attempt to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst i have try to be a neutral a possible regard contentious issue you should always remember that this document represent only one viewpoint i would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusion some relevant book be list in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have present this article a an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the question ask by the imaginary theist be question which have be cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup be create some other frequently ask question be answer in a companion article please note that this article be arguably slant towards answer question pose from a christian viewpoint this be because the faq file reflect question which have actually be ask and it be predominantly christian who proselytize on alt.atheism so when i talk of religion i be talk primarily about religion such a christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine be much of the discussion will apply to other religion but some of it may not `` what be atheism '' atheism be characterize by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheist go far and believe that god do not exist the former be often refer to a the `` weak atheist '' position and the latter a `` strong atheism '' it be important to note the difference between these two position `` weak atheism '' be simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god `` strong atheism '' be a positive belief that god do not exist please do not fall into the trap of assume that all atheist be `` strong atheist '' some atheist believe in the non-existence of all god others limit their atheism to specific god such a the christian god rather than make flat-out denial `` but disbelieve in god the same thing a believe he exist '' definitely not disbelief in a proposition mean that one do not believe it to be true not believe that something be true be not equivalent to believe that it be false one may simply have no idea whether it be true or not which brings u to agnosticism `` what be agnosticism then '' the term 'agnosticism be coin by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in 1876. he define an agnostic a someone who disclaim `` strong '' atheism and believe that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic be someone who believe that we do not and can not know for sure whether god exists word be slippery thing and language be inexact beware of assume that you can work out someone 's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people use agnosticism to mean `` weak atheism '' and use the word `` atheism '' only when refer to `` strong atheism '' beware also that because the word `` atheist '' have so many shade of meaning it be very difficult to generalize about atheist about all you can say for sure be that atheist believe in god for example it certainly the case that all atheist believe that science be the best way to find out about the universe `` so what be the philosophical justification or basis for atheism '' there be many philosophical justification for atheism to find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist best to ask her many atheist feel that the idea of god a present by the major religion be essentially self-contradictory and that it be logically impossible that such a god could exist others be atheist through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exists `` but it impossible to prove the non-existence of something '' there be many counter-examples to such a statement for example it be quite simple to prove that there do not exist a prime number large than all other prime number of course this deal with well-defined object obey well-defined rule whether god or universe be similarly well-defined be a matter for debate however assume for the moment that the existence of a god be not provably impossible there be still subtle reason for assume the non-existence of god if we assume that something do not exist it be always possible to show that this assumption be invalid by find a single counter-example if on the other hand we assume that something do exist and if the thing in question be not provably impossible show that the assumption be invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a thing might be found to show that it there such an exhaustive search be often impractical or impossible there be no such problem with large prime because we can prove that they exist therefore it be generally accepted that we must assume thing do not exist unless we have evidence that they do even theist follow this rule most of the time they believe in unicorn even though they conclusively prove that no unicorn exist anywhere to assume that god exists be to make an assumption which probably can not be test we can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god do not exist since that be an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exists instead they generally restrict their claim so a to cover variety of god described by follower of various religion so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may be possible to prove that say a god a described by a particular religious book do not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any present-day religion exists in practice believe that no god described by any religion exists be very close to believe that no god exists however it be sufficiently different that counter-arguments base on the impossibility of disprove every kind of god be not really applicable `` but what if god be essentially non-detectable '' if god interacts with our universe in any way the effect of his interaction must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable if god be essentially non-detectable it must therefore be the case that he do not interact with our universe in any way many atheist would argue that if god do not interact with our universe at all it be of no importance whether he exists or not if the bible be to be believe god be easily detectable by the israelite surely he should still be detectable today note that i be not demand that god interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect cause by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him from all the other thing that exist `` ok you may think there 's a philosophical justification for atheism but it still a religious belief '' one of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion be `` the redefinition game '' the cynical view of this game be a follow person a begin by make a contentious statement when person b point out that it be true person a gradually re-defines the word he use in the statement until he arrives at something person b be prepared to accept he then record the statement along with the fact that person b have agree to it and continue eventually a us the statement a an `` agree fact '' but us his original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally need to get b to agree to it rather than be see to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along the point of this digression be that the answer to the question `` atheism a religious belief '' depends crucially upon what be meant by '' religious '' `` religion '' be generally characterize by belief in a superhuman control power -- especially in some sort of god -- and by faith and worship worth point out in passing that some variety of buddhism be not `` religion '' accord to such a definition atheism be certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor be it categorize by worship in any meaningful sense widen the definition of '' religious '' to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspect of human behaviour suddenly become class a `` religious '' a well -- such a science politics and watch tv `` ok so not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science be still just an act of faith like religion be '' firstly not entirely clear that sceptical atheism be something one actually believe in secondly it be necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheist try to adopt a few core belief a possible and even those be subject to question if experience throw them into doubt science have a number of core assumption for example it be generally assume that the law of physic be the same for all observer these be the sort of core assumption atheist make if such basic idea be call '' act of faith '' then almost everything we know must be say to be base on act of faith and the term loses it meaning faith be more often use to refer to complete certain belief in something accord to such a definition atheism and science be certainly not act of faith of course individual atheist or scientist can be a dogmatic a religious follower when claim that something be `` certain '' this be not a general tendency however there be many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists faith be also use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly fit that definition a sceptical atheism have no belief strong atheism be closer but still really match a even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when assert that god do not exist `` if atheism be not religious surely anti-religious '' it be an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone a either `` for '' or '' against '' `` friend '' or `` enemy '' the truth be not so clear-cut atheism be the position that run logically counter to theism in that sense it can be say to be `` anti-religion '' however when religious believer speak of atheist be `` anti-religious '' they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theist this categorization of atheist a hostile towards religion be quite unfair atheist attitude towards theist in fact cover a broad spectrum most atheist take a `` live and let live '' attitude unless question they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friend of course this may be in part because atheism be not `` socially acceptable '' in many country a few atheist be quite anti-religious and may even try to `` convert '' others when possible historically such anti-religious atheist have make little impact on society outside the eastern bloc country to digress slightly the soviet union be originally dedicate to separation of church and state just like the usa soviet citizen be legally free to worship a they wish the institution of `` state atheism '' come about when stalin take control of the soviet union and try to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the population some atheist be quite vocal about their belief but only where they see religion encroach on matter which be not it business -- for example the government of the usa such individual be usually concerned that church and state should remain separate `` but if you allow religion to have a say in the run of the state surely the same a state atheism '' the principle of the separation of church and state be that the state shall not legislate concern matter of religious belief in particular it mean not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it can not promote any belief which be religious in nature religion can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matter for example religious believer have historically be responsible for encourage many political reform even today many organization campaign for an increase in spending on foreign aid be found a religious campaign so long a they campaign concern secular matter and so long a they do not discriminate on religious ground most atheist be quite happy to see them have their say `` what about prayer in school if there 's no god why do you care if people pray '' because people who do pray be voter and lawmaker and tend to do thing that those who pray just ignore also christian prayer in school be intimidate to non-christians even if they be told that they need not join in the diversity of religious and non-religious belief mean that it be impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non-prayers tend to have friend and family who pray it be reasonable to care about friend and family waste their time even without other motif `` you mention christian who campaign for increase foreign aid what about atheist why there any atheist charity or hospital atheist object to the religious charity '' there be many charity without religious purpose that atheist can contribute to some atheist contribute to religious charity a well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheist even do voluntary work for charity found on a theistic basis most atheist seem to feel that atheism worth shout about in connection with charity to them atheism be just a simple obvious everyday matter and so be charity many feel that somewhat cheap not to say self-righteous to use simple charity a an excuse to plug a particular set of religious belief to `` weak '' atheist building a hospital to say `` i do not believe in god '' be a rather strange idea rather like hold a party to say `` today be not my birthday '' why the fuss atheism be rarely evangelical `` you say atheism anti-religious but be it perhaps a backlash against one 's upbringing a way of rebel '' perhaps it be for some but many people have parent who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist idea upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheist also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion a a backlash against an atheist upbringing a a way of be different on the other hand many people choose religion a a way of conform to the expectation of others on the whole we conclude much about whether atheism or religion be backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently `` how do atheist differ from religious people '' they believe in god all there be to it atheist may listen to heavy metal -- backwards even -- or they may prefer a verdi requiem even if they know the word they may wear hawaiian shirt they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robe many buddhist lack a belief in any sort of god some atheist even carry a copy of the bible around -- for argue against of course whoever you be the chance be you have met several atheist without realise it atheist be usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance `` unexceptional but atheist less moral than religious people '' that depends if you define morality a obedience to god then of course atheist be less moral a they obey any god but usually when one talk of morality one talk of what be acceptable `` right '' and unacceptable `` wrong '' behaviour within society human be social animal and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other this be a good enough reason to discourage most atheist from `` anti-social '' or `` immoral '' behaviour purely for the purpose of self-preservation many atheist behave in a `` moral '' or `` compassionate '' way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other human so why do they care what happens to others they know they simply be that way naturally there be some people who behave `` immorally '' and try to use atheism to justify their action however there be equally many people who behave `` immorally '' and then try to use religious belief to justify their action for example `` here be a trustworthy say that deserves full acceptance jesus christ come into the world to save sinner ... but for that very reason i be show mercy so that in me ... jesus christ might display his unlimited patience a an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever '' the above quote be from a statement make to the court on february 17th 1992 by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin it seem that for every atheist mass-murderer there be a religious mass-murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conduct by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorate after `` born again '' experience while only 4 of respondent say they have driven intoxicate before be `` born again '' 12 have do so after conversion similarly 5 have use illegal drug before conversion 9 after two percent admit to engage in illicit sex before salvation 5 after `` freethought today '' september 1991 p 12 so it seem that at best religion do not have a monopoly on moral behaviour `` be there such a thing a atheist morality '' if you mean `` be there such a thing a morality for atheist `` then the answer be yes a explain above many atheist have idea about morality which be at least a strong a those held by religious people if you mean `` do atheism have a characteristic moral code `` then the answer be no atheism by itself do not imply anything much about how a person will behave most atheist follow many of the same `` moral rule '' a theist but for different reason atheist view morality a something create by human accord to the way human feel the world 'ought to work rather than see it a a set of rule decreed by a supernatural be `` then atheist just theist who be deny god '' a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over 90 of the atheist who respond become atheist because religion do not work for them they have found that religious belief be fundamentally incompatible with what they observe around them atheist be not unbeliever through ignorance or denial they be unbeliever through choice the vast majority of them have spent time study one or more religion sometimes in very great depth they have make a careful and consider decision to reject religious belief this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual 's personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism be often the only one that make sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make `` but atheist want to believe in god '' atheist live their life a though there be nobody watch over them many of them have no desire to be watch over no matter how good-natured the '' big brother '' figure might be some atheist would like to be able to believe in god -- but so what should one believe thing merely because one want them to be true the risk of such an approach should be obvious atheist often decide that want to believe something be not enough there must be evidence for the belief `` but of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of god -- they be unwilling in their soul to see '' many if not most atheist be previously religious a have be explain above the vast majority have seriously consider the possibility that god exists many atheist have spent time in prayer try to reach god of course it be true that some atheist lack an open mind but assume that all atheist be bias and insincere be offensive and closed-minded comment such a `` of course god be there you just look properly '' be likely to be view a patronize certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it be vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they be be sincere if they say that they have search for god if you be not willing to believe that they be basically tell the truth debate be futile. '' the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist '' many atheist live a purposeful life they decide what they think give meaning to life and they pursue those goal they try to make their life count not by wish for eternal life but by have an influence on other people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leave his mark on history it be a natural human tendency to look for `` meaning '' or `` purpose '' in random event however it be by no mean obvious that `` life '' be the sort of thing that have a `` meaning '' to put it another way not everything which look like a question be actually a sensible thing to ask some atheist believe that ask `` what be the meaning of life '' be a silly a ask `` what be the meaning of a cup of coffee '' they believe that life have no purpose or meaning it just be `` so how do atheist find comfort in time of danger '' there be many way of obtain comfort from family friend or even pet or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individual believe in thing because they be comfort or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end a decision for the individual concerned most atheist be unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if search for truth sometimes make them feel unhappy just hard luck. '' atheist worry that they might suddenly be show to be wrong '' the short answer be `` no do you '' many atheist have be atheist for year they have encounter many argument and much suppose evidence for the existence of god but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousand of year of religious belief result in any good proof of the existence of god atheist therefore tend to feel that they be unlikely to be prove wrong in the immediate future and they stop worry about it `` so why should theist question their belief the same argument apply '' no because the belief be question be not similar weak atheism be the sceptical `` default position '' to take it asserts nothing strong atheism be a negative belief theism be a very strong positive belief atheist sometimes also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believer but to everyone else `` what sort of harm '' religion represent a huge financial and work burden on mankind not just a matter of religious believer waste their money on church building think of all the time and effort spent building church pray and so on imagine how that effort could be well spent many theist believe in miracle heal there have be plenty of instance of ill people be `` heal '' by a priest cease to take the medicine prescribed to them by doctor and die a a result some theist have die because they have refuse blood transfusion on religious ground it be arguable that the catholic church 's opposition to birth control -- and condom in particular -- be increase the problem of overpopulation in many third-world country and contribute to the spread of aid world-wide religious believer have be know to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of a different religion `` those real believer they just claimed to be believer a some sort of excuse '' what make a real believer there be so many one true religion hard to tell look at christianity there be many compete group all convince that they be the only true christian sometimes they even fight and kill each other how be an atheist suppose to decide who 's a real christian and who when even the major christian church like the catholic church and the church of england decide amongst themselves in the end most atheist take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who call himself a christian and us christian belief or dogma to justify his action should be consider a christian maybe some of those christian be just pervert christian teach for their own end -- but surely if the bible can be so readily use to support un-christian act it be much of a moral code if the bible be the word of god why he have make it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your belief a perversion of what your god intend if there be no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so sorry but if someone claim that he believe in jesus and that he murder others because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him a christian `` obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question but since nobody have ever prove that god do not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious belief share by all faith be nonsense '' that do not hold because a be point out at the start of this dialogue positive assertion concern the existence of entity be inherently much harder to disprove than negative one nobody have ever prove that unicorn exist but that make it unlikely that they be myth it be therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it be to hold a positive assertion by default of course `` weak '' atheist would argue that assert nothing be well still `` well if atheism 's so great why be there so many theist '' unfortunately the popularity of a belief have little to do with how `` correct '' it be or whether it `` work '' consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo-sciences many atheist feel that it be simply a human weakness to want to believe in god certainly in many primitive human society religion allows the people to deal with phenomenon that they do not adequately understand of course there 's more to religion than that in the industrialize world we find people believe in religious explanation of phenomenon even when there be perfectly adequate natural explanation religion may have start a a mean of attempt to explain the world but nowadays it serf other purpose a well `` but so many culture have developed religion surely that must say something '' not really most religion be only superficially similar for example worth remember that religion such a buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense of course most religion be quick to denounce compete religion so rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another `` what about all the famous scientist and philosopher who have conclude that god exists '' for every scientist or philosopher who believe in a god there be one who do not besides a have already be point out the truth of a belief be not determine by how many people believe it also it be important to realize that atheist do not view famous scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religious leader a famous scientist be only human she may be an expert in some field but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight many respect scientist have make themselves look foolish by speak on subject which lie outside their field of expertise `` so be you really say that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing '' not entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question have property which have help it so spread so far the theory of memetics talk of `` meme '' -- set of idea which can propagate themselves between human mind by analogy with gene some atheist view religion a set of particularly successful parasitic meme which spread by encourage their host to convert others some meme avoid destruction by discourage believer from question doctrine or by use peer pressure to keep one-time believer from admit that they be mistaken some religious meme even encourage their host to destroy host control by other meme of course in the memetic view there be no particular virtue associate with successful propagation of a meme religion be not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease be a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it `` even if religion be not entirely true at least it put across important message what be the fundamental message of atheism '' there be many important idea atheist promote the follow be just a few of them be surprised to see idea which be also present in some religion there be more to moral behaviour than mindlessly follow rule be especially sceptical of positive claim if you want your life to have some sort of meaning up to you to find it search for what be true even if it make you uncomfortable make the most of your life a probably the only one have no good rely on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because something 's popular mean good if you must assume something assume something easy to test believe thing just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly all belief should be open to question thanks for take the time to read this article mathew -- -- -begin pgp

b"how about this description `` an object that be at one time both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle '' i hold that no object satisfy this description could exist the description be inconsistent and hence describes an object that could not exist now suppose someone point to a bicycle and say `` that object be at one time both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle '' this do not mean that the bicycle do not exist it measn that the description be incorrectly apply the atheist say `` the description of god that i have be present with be contradictory and hence describe something that can not exist '' now your position so far a i can gather be that god exists but the description atheist have be present with be simply bad description of it this be roughly analogous to someone who have never see a bicycle and when they ask for a description from people who claim to have see one be told that it be a `` euclidean circle-square '' can they be blame for doubt rather strongly that this 'bicycle exists at all no kid sincerely ray ingles ingles engin.umich.edu"
b'well this particular thread of vituperation slop it venom over into alt.atheism where we spend most of our time entertain argument against our belief system without resort to accuse others of bigotry somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originate in rec.scouting since i always understood scout to teach tolerance and diversity i understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race religion ethnic background sex or other inconsequential characteristic all the evidence see indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in god be exactly such inconsequential characteristic thus pending far evidence i conclude that those who show prejudice against such people be bigot and organization that exclude such people be discriminatory'

b"the recent rise of nostalgia in this group combine with the incredible level of utter bullshit have prompt me to comb through my archive and pull out some of `` the best of alt.atheism '' for your reading pleasure i 'll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demand that i stop or i run out of good material i be particularly careful in the past about save attribution i think the follow come from john a. johnson but someone correct me if wrong this be probably the long of my entire collection ________________________________________________________ so that the prophecy be fulfil in consider the christian religion and judging it accord to it claim it be important to look at it claim at fulfil earlier jewish prophecy the scribe matthew be perhaps the most eager to draw out what he think be prophetic answer in the career of jesus of nazareth a you will see matthew 's main strategy be to take various old testament passage often not even about the promise messiah and apply them to the circumstance in the new testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the account since the gospel be write at least 35 year after jesus be execute we do not know how much happen exactly a state but for purpose of analysis we will take particular claim at face value immanuel we begin of course at the begin mt 1.21-22 `` mary will bear a son and you joseph will name him 'jesus which mean g 'd be salvation for he will save his people from their sin '' all this happen to fulfil what the lord have spoken by a prophet isaiah 7.1-16 in the day of ahaz c. 750 bce king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel make war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not quite conquer it when the house of david i.e ahaz and his court in judah be told of this ... it heart and the heart of it people shook ... and the lord g 'd say to isaiah `` go to meet with ahaz ... '' ... and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah naturally say `` ask a sign of g 'd your lord it can be a deep a sheol or a high a heaven '' but ahaz say `` i ask i will not put the lord to a test '' then isaiah say `` hear then o house of david be it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman be with child and will bear a son and name him `` immanuel '' which mean `` g 'd be with u '' he will eat curd and honey when he know how to refuse evil and choose good for before the child know how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two king you dread will have be desert ... matthew home in on just the sentence that be in italic far he the hebrew word `` almah '' young woman a specifically `` virgin '' but this be not a prophecy about the messiah it be not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 year later it be not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about jesus matthew have make use of a verse out of context and try to make it fit the specific case of mary it should be note that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be make to fit mary mary virgin or not be indeed a young woman with child of course the fit be shady and have problem jesus while thought of by later christian to be g 'd walk among men be never call by the name immanuel if christianity wish to claim this prophecy for jesus it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy ... a second class prophecy not too convincing egypt after jesus 's birth in bethlehem matthew tell about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt a if he wish to liken jesus to moses this be do to escape an allege infanticidal rampage of the king herod mt 2.15 ... and remain there until the death of herod this be to fulfil what the lord have spoken `` out of egypt i have cal-led my son '' what the lord really say be this hosea 11.1 when israel be a child i love him and out of egypt i call my son the more i call them my people the more they go from me they kept sacrifice to the ba'als and kept burning incense to idol matthew conveniently omits the rest of hosea 's oracle but it be indeed israel that once call out of egypt want to return this be history jesus be certainly not be spoken of here and if we be to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesus that flees and resists g 'd again this prophecy be just not a convincing a matthew probably have hop rachel weeps while jesus be off vacation in egypt matthew say that king herod sought to kill him and thus order the execution of all young male child matthew then writes mt 2.17-18 by this that which be spoken by the prophet jeremiah be fulfil `` a voice be heard in ramah wail and loud lamentation -- rachel weep for her child she refuse to be console because they be no more '' the reference be to a passage in jeremiah 31.15 refer to the carry off of israel into exile by sargon of assyria in 722 bce rachel the ancestor of the major tribe of israel ephraim and manasseh be say to weep for her descendant who be `` no more '' it be metaphorical of course since rachel live and dy before the hebrew be even in the egyptian exile it be interest to note that it be leah not rachel who be the ancestor of the judeans the land where jesus and bethlehem be if anyone should do weep for her `` child '' it be leah the only connexion that rachel have with bethlehem be that the legend have it that she be bury north of the city '' on the way to ephrath bethlehem '' a for herod and his infanticide it be rather unlikely that such an event actually occur one never know but the event be not mention or allude to anywhere else in the bible nor be it mention in any of the secular record of the time herod be particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deed of herod be carefully record this might be a prime example of how event be add to jesus 's life to enhance the message of the church 's gospel because of the whole story 's similarity to the tale of the infant moses in egypt it be highly likely that it be a device set up by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesus it be not surprising that matthew conveniently neglect to mention the rest of the jeremiah quote the `` child '' the prophet speaks of be not dead but exile in the assyrian empire g'd comfort the weep rachel say that the child will be return -- he will gather them back together of course this would not suit matthew 's purpose a the child he speaks of be dead for good again the `` prophecy '' matthew set up be not even that and to anyone who bother to check it out be not too convincing the nazarene we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another matthean prophecy after leave egypt joseph wife take the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth mt 2.23 ... that what be spoken of by the prophet might be fulfil `` he shall be call a nazarene '' first thing we notice be that matthew do not mention the name of the prophet s this time second we have to ask who `` he '' be there be no messianic prophecy speak of a nazarene bad there be no prophecy period mention a nazarene still bad there be no nazarene mention in the old testament at all in the book of judge an angel tell samson 's mother that she will judge 13.5 `` ... conceive and bear a son no razor shall tough his head for he will be a nazirite to his god from the day of his birth he will deliver israel from the hand of the philistine '' this be of course not a prophecy of jesus or the messiah of g 'd but it be the best that can be found obviously matthew have begin to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecy in that he be simple make them up now bearing our disease jesus next go around heal people of physical illness and disability mt 8.17 this be to fulfil what be spoken by the prophet isaiah `` he take our infirmity and bore our disease '' a expect the verse quote in isaiah be quote out of context and a few word be skewed to fit the christian scheme we have be 53.4 surely he the suffer servant have borne our sickness and carry our pain from a reading of the surround passage in isaiah we know that the prophet be speak in present tense of the collective nation of israel jehovah 's chosen servant and people he speaks to the israelite suffer in exile in the voice of the gentile nation that look upon it this image be deeply ingrain in jewish identity -- an image of a chastise yet cherished israel a the instrument of the nation salvation by g 'd the verse speak of israel take on the sickness which be the literal and metaphorical manifestation of guilt and discipline they do not speak of a `` servant '' go around and heal people notice that the servant in isaiah take on the sickness and pain of the nation and individual jew jesus a we all know do not take the disease onto himself the verse here in isaiah be not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that have already happen while it be believe that jesus take on the eternal punishment of hell he do not bear the illness he heal so while someone might want to say that figuratively jesus reenact the deed of israel in his spiritual atonement he have to admit that matthew 's parallel miss where he intend it to have it effect silent messiah upon heal multitude of commoner it be say that jesus order them to keep quiet presumable so that he arouse the attention of the local ruler mt 12.15-21 this be to fulfill what be spoken by the prophet isaiah `` behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul be pleased i will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the gentile he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the street he will not break a bruise reed or quench a smolder wick until he brings justice to victory and the gentile will hope in his name '' the isaiah passage quote read be 42.1-4 behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delight i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the nation we will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the street he will not break a bruise reed or quench a smolder wick he will faithfully bring forth justice he will not fail burn dimly or be discourage bruise until he have establish justice in the earth and the coastland await his law you see matthew have conveniently left out part of the passage because it do not suit the dealing of jesus christian could never think of jesus fail never would the `` light '' of mankind burn dimly but the servant nation of israel will indeed come to an end when it job be do when the gentile come to embrace g 'd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the child of g 'd also the end phrase have be change from the judaic `` ... the coastland await his law '' to the christologic `` the gentile will hope in his name '' while the original proclaims the torah law of jehovah the other rewrite it to fit it strange doctrine of `` believe in the name '' if one have any doubt the servant refer to be not jesus one have only to read the whole chapter isaiah 42 and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant `` a people robbed and plunder ... '' so we see that when matthew 's attempt at '' prophecy '' be examine it crumbles three day and three night now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god jesus himself he speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection mt 12.40 for a jonah be in the belly of the whale for three day and three night so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three day and three night before any far discussion can occur it be necessary to know how the jew understood day a far a day name go each be 24 hour long last from sunset 6pm to the follow sunset 6pm what be refer to a a `` day '' be the period of light from 6am to the end sunset at 6pm thus accord to our time scale a sabbath day begin at 6pm friday even and last until 6pm saturday even this be why the jew celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturday instead of sunday it seem like a real miracle that christian forget that saturday be indeed the seventh and last day of the week thus when day and night be refer to together 12 hour daylight portion and 12 hour night period be be spoken of thus jesus say that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three day and three night a the good book tell u jesus be crucify on the `` ninth hour '' which be 3pm friday afternoon he then be put into the grave sometime after that then jesus left the grave `` rise '' before dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath be over what this mean be that jesus be use our time for clarity in the grave from 6pm friday night to some time before 6am sunday morning we could also add a little time before 6pm friday since the bible be not specific here what this mean use jewish time be that he be in the grave for one day two night and possibly a couple of hour of one day certainly this be a problem for jesus prediction there be absolutely no way we be even able to have his death involve three day and three night -- even use modern time measurement we then be lead to suspect that this error be another one of matthew 's little mistake and that the gospel writer put false word into his god 's mouth and no matter who make the prediction it be more than unconvincing ... it be counter-convincing hearing understand jesus tool on a habit of speak to his vast audience in parable -- story in which a deeper meaning could be found if you be already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of jesus he reason that those who can understand the parable be the one he want if the people can not understand them there be no need to bother with them since they will not accept the `` plain '' message any well matthew say mt 13.14-16 with them the audience indeed in fulfil the prophecy of isaiah which say `` you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive because this people 's heart have grown dull their ear be heavy of hearing and they have shut their eye so the they would not perceive with them her with their ear and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them '' the original isaiah passage be part of his earlier work his call to the ministry this be in 740 bce when israel be flourish right before it fall under the authority of assyria isaiah see the good time end and also a vision from g 'd call him to bring reform to israel and judah be 6.9-13 and g 'd say `` go and say to this people hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive make the heart of this people fat make their ear heavy and shut their eye so they will not see with their eye or hear with their ear and understand with their heart and turn and be heal '' then isaiah say `` how long lord '' and he say `` until the city lie waste without inhabitant and house without men and the land be utterly desolate and the g'ds take men far away and forsaken place be many in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burn again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stand when the tree be fell '' the holy seed be it stump here we see that it be really g 'd who cause the people of israel to stop listen to the prophet 's warning but reaffirms the promise make to solomon 's and david 's seed/lineage if you read the rest of isaiah you find that this be do to fulfil the plan of g 'd to use israel a a servant a light to the nation look at isaiah 42.18-25 48.20 49.3 we see that matthew have cut-and-pasted just a little portion of isaiah 's verse to suit his own gospel need more than that he have alter the word to make it fit the people who understand jesus 's story and a we see isaiah 's verse be not prophecy but rather command from g 'd to him in the present once again matthew 's prophecy fall flat on it face matthew try again to make jesus 's parable look like they have the prophetic approval mt 13.35 ... he say nothing to them without a parable this be to fulfil what be spoken of by the prophet `` i will open my mouth to them in parable i will utter that which have be hidden since the foundation of the world '' matthew really botch up here he attempt to quote not from a prophet but from the psalm p 78.2-4 i will open my mouth in parable i will utter dark saying of old thing that we all have heard and know thing that our father have told u we will not hide them from their child but tell to the come generation the glorious deed of the lord ... a be point out the verse in the psalm do not really come from a prophet you might also want to know that earlier copy of matthew 's gospel even insert isaiah 's name a this prophet apparently later scribe caught the error and try to cover some of it up perhaps the most significant part of this be that once again matthew have alter the old testament scripture a jesus have say earlier he speaks in parable so that some will not understand them the parable in the psalm be not to be hidden far they speak of thing `` know that our father have told u '' jesus deal with thing `` hidden since the foundation of the world '' indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion this be in direct opposition to the parable in the psalm no wonder matthew have to rewrite them and still once again matthew 's artificial prophecy fall flat on their face but christian rarely look at this matthew 's prophecy the only thing about christianity that be begin to look bad excuse of little faith in mt 17.14-21 we see that the disciple be able to go around cast out demon except in one case not know what epilepsy be the people thought those with the disease be possesed with demon it be no wonder that the disciple be unable to `` dispossess '' the epileptic but jesus perhaps no more enlighten than they be report to have rebuke them say they have enough faith this seem strange why be this demon special it seem that either a true believer have faith or he do not apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountain of course you will find no one these day that can move real mountain no one part sea the only miracle the charismatics can speak of be those rumour to happen on trip to mexico or some faraway place major miracle be make some old woman 's arthritis feel well on sunday morning t.v and the god include jesus be always shroud in ancient lore and writing protect from the skeptic in their sacred past they be either dead sleep or hiding in heaven with people rumour about their imminent return and their great miracle of day long go yet life go on tale of mystic story of miracle -- all in a distant time or a distant place god use to reveal themselves to men in the old day jehovah too but now they be silent all the theologian give be various excuse a to why we get to see god anymore too lazy not zealous enough sinful just his `` plan '' we put too many of our own demand on g'd 's appearance if we have the right faith if we be willing to meet g 'd on his term ... yet even the most pious of men have not see g 'd you dear reader have not see g 'd not literally you know that to be true i know presumptuous and bold but search your heart you know what i mean all that see religion do be make people feel good and content about not see g 'd they say our little faith do not merit u to see g 'd sometimes they say `` see the love in these people you worship with ... see the life of people change ... that be see g 'd '' thus people get lull to sleep satisfied with turn g 'd into the everyday sight but that be not see g 'd a i be speak of ... it be not see g 'd the way people use to see what we see in the world that be good be the compassion of human heart the love give and take by men and woman the forgiveness practise by christian atheist alike beauty create by the mind of man these be the thing that be do these be what we see but it be say this be so only because everybody have little faith jesus ride on an as shortly after accept the role of the jewish messiah king jesus request a donkey be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem mt 21.5 this take place to fulfil what be spoken by the prophet say tell the daughter of zion `` behold your king be come to you humble mount on an as and on a ass-colt '' of course the passage quote from zechariah 9.9 read a little differently lo your king come to you he be triumphant and victorious humble and rid on an as on an ass- colt ... he will command peace to the nation there all that much difference here except that zechariah only involves one animal -- an ass-colt -- while matthew read the poetic word slightly differently thus he have jesus call for both a colt and an adult as from matthew 's version we get a comical picture of the divine christ sweat it to straddle two donkey this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma we find that in the account write earlier by st. mark only the colt be call for and brought to jesus this indeed fit the verse of zechariah properly and show u that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verse he have bungle now exclude many respectable christian i have met i have notice that while christ be thought to have ridden on ass the situation be often reverse nowadays ... then enter the jerusalem temple the priest be angered at people and youngster call jesus the messiah but jesus reply a we might expect matthew to have do mt 21.16 you read out of the mouth of babe and suckling thou have brought perfect praise it be more likely that matthew make this response up since jesus be never one to point out such little `` prophetic '' thing and since a we might expect the quote be in error which seem to fit matthew 's track record quite well we might ask jesus or matthew `` you read '' for the source read psalm 8.1-2 o yahweh our lord how majestic be your name in the whole world you whose glory be chant above the heaven by babe and infant you have found a bulwark against your foe to still the enemy and the avenger the passage hardly need comment there be no `` perfect praise '' spoken of in the psalm and what praise be there be give to g 'd not his messiah king and not jesus a mention it seem to be just one more case of matthew 's pen make up convenient prophetic scripture yhvh say to my lord ... jesus be say to have ask from whom the promise jewish messiah-king be to be descend the jew agree -- it be king david but then jesus counter by quote psalm 110 `` the lord say to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemy under your foot '' take at face value jesus be deny the necessity of davidic descent one assumes he be in opposition to their answer of course the christian answer be that he agrees but be try to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king tempt to believe this if one be a christian and not interested in matter of investigation but there be problem in jesus 's time the psalm be thought to be about the messiah and it be easy to see why david might refer to the messiah a his superior we need only look at the scripture about the messiah to see that he be expect to be a great king bring the jew to time even well than those under david's rule of course the jew listen have no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such a the christian worship the problem lie in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several jew of jesus 's time have also make one must remember that there be various faction among the jew often a a result of different expectation of the messiah-king jesus be apparently one of these adventist like his audience who thought the messiah 's advent be imminent and who interpret psalm 110 among others a be messianic what be the problem then psalm 110 literally read yhvh 's utterance to my lord '' sit at my right hand until i make your enemy your footstool '' yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion rule in the midst of your foe your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountain `` you be a priest of the order of melchizedek forever '' the word `` lord '' be often mistakenly capitalise by christian bible to denote divinity in this lord but in the hebrew the word be `` adoni '' and no capitalisation exists adoni simply mean '' lord '' a generic term a we would use it it be use often in the scripture to refer to king and to g 'd it be merely an address of respect there be nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king that this be suppose to be write by david be not certain the title of the psalm translates to either `` a psalm of david '' or `` a psalm about david '' it seem fitting to assume it to be write by a court poet about david 's covenant and endorsement from g 'd if the psalm have be write by david it be unlikely that he would be talk about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descend from david be not present in david 's age we have extensive tale of david 's doings and saying -- none of which include any praise of a messiah many of the psalm show evidence of be write long after david be dead in time of the exile when g 'd have put his show of favour for david 's kingdom on hold the description in the psalm fit david very well david be promise by g 'd a rise to power victory over his enemy successful judgement among the nation he conquer he achieve the priesthood common to melchizedek in be a righteous king enable to bless the people it all fit we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alone though here there be not artificial prophecy allude to though his use of the scripture be rather questionable still this event be common to the other gospel too so we let matthew off a little more easily this time it be interest to note though how matthew dress up the event the earlier gospel of mark tell the tale with jesus simply speak to a crowd matthew have the pharisee who become the religious competition of an infant christianity be the target of jesus 's question a we might expect matthew writes that the event end up by embarrass the pharisee such power be the pen moses jesus have it together all along ... we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in john 's gospel the gospel story of john deserves special treatment because it seem to be so far remove from the real event of jesus 's career a told by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at one verse the early church leader found a religion on the jewish hope of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promise make by g 'd when construct the history of abraham moses write of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people while this be accomplish eventually under the rule of king david the christian who come along later decide that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they expand on the promise preach about a heavenly kingdom john 8.56 j.c. speak your father abraham rejoice to see my day he say it and be glad it would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham but abraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah or anything christian i have try and fail to find any event in the old testament which corresponds to john 's little prophecy it be par for the course to see st. john make up old testament backing just like his forerunner matthew many christian know that their faith have many of it foundation in such fraud and it be surprising they still cling to it the potter's field we be told that jesus be betrayed while in jerusalem by one of his follower juda iscariot matthew writes mt 27.5-10 and throw down the piece of silver in the temple juda depart ... but the chief priest take the silver say `` it lawful for u to put it in the treasury since it be blood money '' so they ... bought a potter 's field with it to bury stranger in ... then be fulfil what be spoken by the prophet jeremiah `` and they take the thirty piece of silver the price of him on whom a price have be set by some of the son of israel and they give them for the potter's field a the lord direct me '' this prophecy be an utterly gross bastardisation of old testament scripture first matthew have make a mistake regard the name of the prophet it be zechariah who utters the verse which matthew make use of zech 11.12-13 ... and they weigh out my wage thirty shekel of silver then yhvh say to me `` cast them to the treasury '' -- the lordly price at which i be paid off by them so i take the thirty shekel of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of yhvh first of all the verse of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of g 'd the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of preside over the people shortly before g 'd would send judah and israel into conflict with one another the word `` treasury '' have be replace by the king james scholar with `` to the potter '' precisely because this make matthew 's quote fit well but this be a blatant error the correct translation of the hebrew be indeed `` treasury '' which also make perfect sense in zechariah 's context whereas `` potter's field '' be totally unrelated whether the mistranslation be intentional or not seem to be beyond speculation however give matthew 's track record one find it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty of course matthew would have ample reason for alter the text the thirty piece of silver match juda 's situation and if a most christian seem to be the reader be willing to disregard the contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy to toss around however the correct translation of zechariah directly contradicts the situation with juda and the high priest the high priest would not put the money in the treasury the worthless shepherd of zechariah do exactly the opposite of course to the average thursday-night bible student the `` prophecy '' a present by matthew would be take at new testament face value to those matthew 's work be convincing enough wine vinegar cast lot then jesus be lead away to be crucify mt 27.34-35 ... they give him vinegar to drink mingle with gall but when he taste it he would not drink it and when they have crucify him they divide his garment among them by cast lot that it might be fulfil what be spoken by the prophet `` they part my garment among them and upon my vesture do they cast lot '' first of all the vinegar offer to jesus be actually common sour wine of the type that roman soldier drank regularly we find that right before jesus dy the soldier themselves give him some to drink -- not pollute with gall jn 19.28-30 jesus ... say `` i thirst '' a bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth when he have receive the vinegar he say `` it be finish '' but matthew seem to be draw on not a passage from the prophet but one from the psalm p 69.20-28 i look for pity but there be none and for comforter but i found none they give me poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they give me vinegar to drink ... add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee let them be blot out of the book of the living of course the sour wine offer to jesus be do at his request of drink this do indeed seem to be a show of pity the psalm quote be about david and his political and military enemy it be not about the messiah or jesus it be then not surprising that we run into far problem when we see that the `` jesus '' in the psalm asks g 'd for the damnation of the `` crucifiers '' whereas the jesus of the gospel say lk 23.34 jesus say `` father forgive them the know what they do '' far matthew miss with his attempt to create prophecy by have gall a bitter substance put into jesus 's drink not his meat a the psalm stipulates with the `` prophecy '' of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask `` what of the cast of lot '' this brings up the 22nd psalm which deserves discussion all by itself suffice it now to say that the fact that jesus 's clothes be divide a told be no great thing it turn out that this happen often to any felon in those day a we will soon see it be perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when apply to jesus it do indeed bring up the interest question a to the quality of jesus 's clothes for a man so remove from worldly possession his ownership of clothes worthy of cast lot raise some suspicion the 22nd psalm this psalm be attribute to david a a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemy it becomes a song of praise to yhvh and of hope take out of context part of it seem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary passage verse 1-2 my god my god why have you forsaken me why be you so far from help me far from the word of my groan oh my god i cry by day but you answer and by night but find no rest jesus be say to have cry the first sentence while on the cross this suggests that the whole psalm be really about jesus rather than king david of course the rest of the first stanza do not fit a nicely to jesus or his execution jesus be not picture a complain about the whole ordeal he be suppose to be like `` the lamb lead mute before it shearer '' indeed jesus do much groan even when on the cross he certainly do not cry by both day and night on the cross 6-8 but i be a worm and no man -- scorn by men ... all who see me mock at me they make face and wag their head `` he commit his cause to yhvh so let him deliver him ... for he delight in him '' this seem to fit jesus 's execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah be call a worm 12-13 many bull encompass me ... they open their mouth widely at me like a raven and roar lion 16-18 yea dog be round about me a company of evildoer encir-cle me they have pierce my hand and foot i can see all my bone ... they divide my garment among them and cast lose for my raiment 19-21 but you yhvh be not far away ... deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflict soul from the horn of the wild bull it would seem quite convincing and sure the early christian father who write of this prophecy thought so too unfortunately this prophecy have a fatal flaw the word `` have pierce '' really do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translation be 16 yea dog be round about me a company of evildoer encircles me like the lion they be at my hand and foot ... in hebrew the phrase `` like the lion '' and a very rare verb form which can mean `` pierce '' differ by one phonetic character the word in the hebrew text be literally `` like the lion '' ka'ari which make sense in the context and even far fit the animal imagery employ by the psalm writer it be convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to `` ka'aru '' but to add the need yet artificial weight to the `` prophecy '' this be just what the christian translator have chosen to do while the correct translation do not eliminate the psalm from refer to jesus it absence do not say much for the honesty of the translator apart from the erroneous verse 16 the psalm do not lend itself to jesus so easily verse 20 speaks of the sufferer be save from a sword rather than a cross this naturally fit the psalm 's true subject king david a a side note we now know that crucifixion do not pierce the hand the palm but rather the forearm this say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrect jesus show his disciple the scar on his palm but then fact bound by our religious belief matthew escape culpability this time a he do not attempt to draw many direct link between this psalm and his lord jesus but the psalm like many others be on the mind of all the gospel writer when they compile the story and interpretation of jesus 's life and death how much these scripture may have contribute to what actually get write down be a question that have serious repercussion for christian theology it be easy to see for those who be not faithful fundamentalist how some of the event in the new testament might have be `` enhance '' by scribe such a the eager matthew but it do less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matter and prophetic claim so far this have not say good thing for st. matthew the reference to the pierce look a lot like jesus's crucifixion john 's gospel recount write about 70 year after the fact tell u at jesus 's execution jn 19.34,37 but one of the soldier pierce his side with a spear and out come blood and water ... these thing take place that scripture be fulfil ... `` the will look on him whom they 've pierce '' of course this be built on a passage take blatantly out of context prophet zechariah tell u how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc 12.7-10 and yhvh will give victory to judah ... and on that day i will seek to destroy the nation that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication ... on jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierce they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child john 's attempt to make up prophecy be perhaps weaker that matthew 's attempt matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage john 's error be grossly obvious and blatant here it do not speak well for any of the gospel writer a it help to show how the prophetic aspect of their religion be found reckon with transgressor after his arrest jesus be quickly execute for claim the jewish kingship messiahship accord to one version of the gospel tale jesus get execute along with two thief mk 15.27 and with him they crucify two robber one on his right one on his left and so the scripture be fulfil which say `` he be reckon with the transgressor '' here mark be try to link jesus to a passage in isaiah 53 about the servant nation of israel the passage be not about the messiah for if one read the whole chapter of isaiah 53 and it surround chapter one see that the servant be a nation the verse be also about what this servant have go through in the past not a prediction of what be to come in any event the servant be thought of a a criminal this also happens to fit the description of jesus have the passage really be about the messiah it still be not at all clear why execute jesus between two thief would fulfill the `` prophecy '' in isaiah jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he be consider a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career lock onto a single event be a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case a we see that mark could have have make a well analogy with general comparison mark go on to tell u how `` those who be crucify with jesus also revile him '' 15.32 this be to be expect from a couple of robber of course in his later recount st. luke decides to change some thing luke tell u lk 23.39-43 and one of the criminal who be hang with him rail `` you the messiah save yourself and u '' this certainly fit with mark 's recount which tell how the people who crucify jesus say `` save yourself '' and that the robber do the same but then luke go on but the other criminal rebuke the first say `` you fear g 'd since you be under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we be receive the due reward for our deed but this man have do nothing wrong and he say `` jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom '' and jesus answer `` verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise '' now this little dialogue seem highly contrive it stretch the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuke his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lament over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffer such a man apparently noble and of principle seem likely to have be a robber we wonder at the amount of theatrics create by luke of course luke 's recount also disagrees with mark 's luke have only one criminal revile jesus not both it be easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account be make up but those who wish to believe it be all part of the error free word of g 'd do not have this avenue open this be yet another example of a writer try to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology in this case the embroidery creates some embarrass problem a we have see the end of the world -- mt 24 now come perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrass passage in the new testament it be found in all three of the synoptic gospel story and cast some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity jesus mention the destruction of the jewish temple and building and his disciple ask him about this and about the end of the world which he have be warn about the disciple tell u when will this the temple's destruction be and what will be the sign of your come and of the close of the age jesus take care that no one lead you astray for many will come in my name say `` i be the christ '' ... you will hear of war and rumour of war ... for this must take place but the end be not yet for nation will rise against nation ... all this be but the begin of the birthpangs they will deliver you up ... put you to death and false prophet will arise and lead many astray ... but he who endures to the end will be save this gospel will be preach throughout the whole world a testimony to the nation and then the end will come so when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet daniel ... let those who be in judea flee to the mountain immediately after the tribulation of those day the sun will be darken ... the star will fall from heaven ... then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribe of the earth will mourn and see the son of man come ... and he will send out his angel ... and gather his elect ... learn the lesson of the fig tree a soon a it branch becomes tender and put forth leaf you know that summer be near so also when you see all these thing you will know that he be near at the very gate truly i say to you this generation will not pas away until all these thing take place ... but of the day and hour no one know not the angel not the son but only the father ... therefore you also must be ready for the son of man be come at an hour you do not expect from this it be clear that jesus thought the world would in within the lifetime of at least some of his disciple he tell them that although he know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready theologian have wet their pant in panic to find some way out of this holy error but unfortunately jesus make himself to explicit he told his disciple that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away there have be some who resort to remove the inerrant nature of the bible and say that the phrase `` this generation shall not pas away ... '' really mean `` this race of people will not pas away ... '' of course the word for generation be use many time to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciple it be an interest notion that when god decide to learn greek he learn it well enough to make himself clear but it be quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciple at least some of them be suppose to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation be completely blown away by look at the apostle response it becomes abundantly clear from rev 22.7 1 peter 4.7 1 john 2.18 and rev 22.20 that jesus meant exactly what he say the end be very near for 2,000 year christian have rationalise this 24th chapter of matthew or ignore it meaning altogether for 2,000 year they have wait for their execute leader to come back hearing of war and rumour of war sure that he be come soon surely he must be all we must do be wait can you imagine how tire he must be sit around up there be holy wait for just the right moment to spring so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazareth joshua-ben-joseph die it be say that after three day or three day and three night or three period of time or three eternal second -- or three of whatever they can decide make for less trouble -- he be see again resurrect glow with divine radiance then the saviour decide it in the best interest of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappear from sight into heaven so the story go anyway a have be see there be many thing attribute to jesus when people get around to write the gospel story down to them jesus be the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have see though that this matter be quite shaky but throughout church history christian have held fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal objection could not be solve with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question to question and investigate have never be the easy way to treat matter thus for 2,000 year the prophecy cite in the new testament have go on largely accepted thing may well continue that way for some time pause a moment to consider the way the doctrine of christianity have be accepted and use properly or improperly to support war and persecution i suppose there be one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold"

b"from what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb be supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicate sophisticated bomb together from instruction _over the phone_ one must need some brain i would expect i read this in an article in `` the australian muslim time '' the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community if this be true perhaps one of the muslim base in north america if they see this post can elaborate i deny this fact the thrust of my argument here be that a salameh be accord to u law innocent a he have not be found guilty in a court of law a his guilt have not be establish it be wrong for people to make posting base on this assumption b islam teach u _not_ to harm innocent if muslim -- who perhaps have not realize that islam teach this -- perform such action it be _not_ _because_ of the teaching of islam but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teaching of islam this be an important distinction i should clarify what muslim usually mean when they say `` muslim '' in general anyone who call themselves a `` muslim '' and do not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teaching of islam be consider to be a muslim thus one who might do thing contrary to islam through ignorance for example do not suddenly _not_ become a muslim if one knowingly transgresses islamic teaching and essential principle though then one do leave islam the term `` muslim '' be to be contrast with `` mu'min '' which mean `` true believer '' however whether a muslim be in reality a mu'min be something know only by god and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term mu'min use very much by muslim in alt.atheism because it be not know to anybody except myself and god whether i for example be a `` true believer '' or not for example i could just be put on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here without anyone know thus when we say `` muslim '' we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teaching by '' muslim '' we do not necessarily mean `` mu'min '' or `` true believer '' in islam"

b"this frayed thread have turn into a patent alt.atheism 5-on-1 ping-pong game and i have any strong disagreement so i 'll try to stick to the one thing i quite follow about the argument it seem to me that there be a contradiction in argue that the bible be `` enlighten for it time '' i.e closer to what we would consider morally good base on our standard and past experience on the one hand i hope this summarizes this argument adequately and on the other hand disclaimer speak from the jewish perspective where `` the bible '' mean what many call the old testament and where the interpretation be not necessarily the raw text but instead the court case commentary and tradition pass down through jewish community this seem the crux to me if you judge the bible accord to a long line of tradition and interpretation come down to the current day rather than on it own merit a a cultural artifact then of course it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values. but if how the bible be actually be use today that be how we should judge it if most people use scissors to cut paper consumer 's report test scissors for paper-cutting ability even though scissors may have be design originally to cut cloth possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teach jewish morality today but it hardly seem fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version be what be `` enlighten for it time '' to attempt to extend the analogy this be like say that the original scissor-makers be unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their time even though they only ever cut cloth and have never even heard of paper not argue that the bible be `` disgust '' though some of the history depict in it be by modern standard however history be full of similar abuse and i think the biblical account be bad than their contemporary -- or possibly ours on the other hand i know of any reason to think the history described in the bible show *less* abuse than their contemporary or ours that complex and benign moral tradition have evolve base on particular mythic interpretation of that history be interest but i still think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history"

b"well say that when an innocent person have be execute this be objectively a murder however who be at blame be another question it seem that the entire society that sanction any sort of execution -- realize the risk -- be to blame yes but there be also a probablity that you will kill someone do any raondom activity presumably you have not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this and i argue that our law system be a similar risk perhaps an innocent person will be punish someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminal go free a a result of our try to prevent punishment of innocent but such accident be to be totally expect give the numner of vehicals on the road again the blame be on society yes but the state be not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false witness okay so this be what you call murder but the question be whether or not all such `` murder '' be wrong be you say that all take of human life be wrong no matter what the circumstance but this be basically how it work society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murder by execution and every member of society share this blame and most people 's definition of murder include some sort of malicious intent which be not involve in an execution be it murder violates the golden rule execution do not because by allow it at all society implicitly accepts the consequence no matter who the innocent victim be reading the mind of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction be moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth matter and the jury system be one method to approximate such a truth that be twelve member must be convince of a truth but then if we read the mind of these people we would know that the conviction be unfair yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we always determine the difference in our flaw system i think that our system be almost a good a possible but it still objectively perfect you see it matter if we *know* it be fair or not objectively it be either fair or it be not but what we know have no effect on an objective system why be you so sure why be *your* reality important but we can assume that the system be fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system say nothing about a totally ideal and objective system well we can have an ideal system but the work system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that be a close an approximation to the ideal system a possible yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this we must realize the consequence of all our action why do you keep separate the justice system from the pack i think our country have an objective system but i think such an objective system can exist in theory without omniscience an objective system be not possible in practice"

yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it too long i read lewis 's article so i comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writing _in general_ so far that his political motif make him a bias writer on islam his anti-islamic polemic a i understand it be often quite subtle and be often base on tell half-truth again read `` orientalism '' by edward say i be _not_ ask you to take what i say on trust in fact i be urge you not to do so but to get this book it be a well-known book and check the evidence out for _yourself_ if slavery be _in reality_ a oppose to in the practice of some muslim oppose by islam then use slave for sexual purpose be necessarily oppose too i understand your point of view selim -- i think rather it be _us_ who be not get through to _you_ some of the point you repeat above i have already answer before regard woman i have make post after post on this subject show that islam be not anti-woman etc however have you be completely ignore my posting or just miss them i just reposted a very good one under the title `` islam and woman '' reposted from soc.religion.islam if this have already disappear from your site then please email me tell me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article imho your understand of the issue of woman in islam be sadly deficient regard slave _my_ post on slavery -- the second one i make which be a repost of an article i write early last year -- be base completely on the qur'an and contains numerous qur'anic verse and hadith to support it point of view our approach be different -- you be argue from a historical standpoint and i be argue directly from the teaching of the qur'an and hadith now just because people say they be muslim and perform a particular action do that automatically mean that their action be part of islam even if it be oppose by the qur'an and sunnah no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the qur'an prohibits drinking now if a person say `` i be a muslim '' and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer do this now mean that islam teach that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point you be judging islam here on capitalist term capitalism be an ideology base largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption be in opposition to islamic teaching to say islam be bad because it be not capitalist be pretty unthinking -- islam do not pretend to be capitalist and do not try to be capitalist this do not mean that islam do not support a free-market -- for it do in general -- but there be other part of capitalism which be oppose to islam a i understand it one can postulate numerous reason for this your theory be that it be because islam be not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your view if you think a you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world be very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world be the foremost in the science so to say that islam be for example anti-education be completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam -- history show that your conclusion be false and that instead there must be other reason for this situation well selim your viewpoint on woman in islam make me question the extent of your knowledge of islam i really think you be not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslim be follow the qur'an

b"why do baby get disease etc here 's the main problem the scenario you outline be reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i be familiar with not only do not support it but indicates something far different the earth by late estimate be about 4.6 billion year old and have have life for about 3.5 billion of those year human have only be around for at most about 200,000 year but the fossil evidence inidcates that life have be change and evolve and in fact disease-ridden long before there be people yes there be fossil that show sign of disease ... mostly bone disorder of course but there be some heck not just fossil evidence but what be able to glean from genetic study show that disease have be around for a long long time if human sin be what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before human deletion uh ... i know of many evolutionary biologist who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there be no evidence that the human genetic code or any other 'started off' in perfect condition it seem to adapt to it envionment in a collective sense really curious a to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapt to virus and bacteria and they to u only a very small percentage of microlife be harmful to human ... and that small percentage seem to be reasonalby constant in size but the rank keep change for example bubonic plague use to be a really nasty disease sure agree but it still pop up from time to time even today ... and do a much damage part of that be because of well sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptom tend to be less severe than in the past this seem to be partly because people who be very susceptible die off long ago and because the really nasty variant 'overgrazed forgive the poor terminology an engineer not a doctor and die off for lack of nearby host i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne be only a few hundred year old and use to be nastier though no killer it seem to be get less nasty w/age ... now wait a minute i have a question human be create perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seem unlikely that satan who 's make the disease would also gift human with the mean to fight them off simpler to make the disease less lethal if he want survivor a far a i can see our immune system imperfect though they may presently be must have be built into u by god i want to be clear on this be you say that god be planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that be not at the time of design necessary that be god make our immune system ahead of time know that adam and eve would sin and their descendent would need to fight off disease here 's another puzzle what exactly do you mean by 'perfect in the phrase 'created ... perfect and without flaw to my mind a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrade over time a 'perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect be *not* a perfect system at least imho or be it that god do something like write a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrapper held together with elmer 's glue that be the original genetic 'instructions be perfect but be 'written in inferior material that have to be carefully tend or would fall apart if so why could god not have use well material be god *incapable* of create a system that could maintain itself of do it just choose not to deletion my main point a i say be that there really any evidence for the explanation you give at least that aware of but i help make a few nitpicks here and there sincerely"

accuracy a it be write thousand of year ago by many author who be record oral tradition that exist many year before thus any claimed 'truth in it be of questionable legitimacy this to say that the bible have no truth in it simply that any truth must be examine before be accepted many of the reader of this group also feel that because any passage be subject to `` interpretation '' any claim that a passage 'means one thing and one thing only be not legitimate note that this feel tends to extend to other book it be also remarkable to many atheist that theist tend to ignore other equally plausible religious book in favour of those of their own religion -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- subject pascal 's wager typical post if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lose nothing -- but if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it be foolish to be an atheist response this argument be know a pascal 's wager it have several flaw firstly it do not indicate which religion to follow indeed there be many mutually exclusive and contradictory religion out there this be often described a the `` avoid the wrong hell '' problem if a person be a follower of religion x he may end up in religion y 's version of hell secondly the statement that `` if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lose nothing '' be not true suppose believe in the wrong god -- the true god might punish you for your foolishness consider also the death that have result from people reject medicine in favour of prayer another flaw in the argument be that it be base on the assumption that the two possibility be equally likely -- or at least that they be of comparable likelihood if in fact the possibility of there be a god be close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive so sadly the argument be only likely to convince those who believe already also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief be base on evidence with some amount of intuition it be not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis formally speak the argument consists of four statement 1. one do not know whether god exists 2. not believe in god be bad for one 's eternal soul if god do exist 3. believe in god be of no consequence if god do not exist 4. therefore it be in one 's interest to believe in god there be two approach to the argument the first be to view 1 a an assumption and 2 a a consequence of it one problem with this approach in the abstract be that it creates information from no information this be consider invalid in information theory statement 1 indicates one have no information about god -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gain from the absolute lack of information about god this violates information entropy -- information have be extract from no information at no `` cost '' the alternative approach be to claim that 1 and 2 be both assumption the problem with this be that 2 be then basically an assumption which state the christian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption the argument thus collapse to `` if you be a christian it be in your interest to believe in god '' -- a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascal intend the argument to be view the big reason why pascal 's wager be a failure be that if god be omniscient he will certainly know who really believe and who believe a a wager he will spurn the latter ... assume he actually care at all whether people believe in him -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- subject what be occam 's razor typical post people keep talk about occam 's razor what be it response william of occam formulate a principle which have become know a occam 's razor in it original form it say `` do not multiply entity unnecessarily '' that be if you can explain something without suppose the existence of some entity then do so nowadays when people refer to occam 's razor they generally express it more generally for example a `` take the simplest solution '' the relevance to atheism be that we can look at two possible explanation for what we see around u 1. there be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which come into be a a result of natural process 2. there be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there be also a god who create the universe clearly this god must be of non-zero complexity give that both explanation fit the fact occam 's razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one unfortunately some argue that there be a third even more simple solution 3. there an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there we just imagine that there be this third option lead u

not play dice '' typical post albert einstein believe in god do you think cleverer than him response einstein do once comment that `` god do not play dice with the universe '' this quotation be commonly mention to show that einstein believe in the christian god use this way it be out of context it refers to einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainty indicate by quantum theory furthermore einstein 's religious background be jewish rather than christian a well quotation show what einstein thought about god be the follow '' i believe in spinoza 's god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concern himself with fate and action of human being '' einstein be unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random event and which would not be dependent upon the observer he believe that qm be incomplete and that a well theory would have no need for statistical interpretation so far no such well theory have be found and much evidence suggests that it never will be a longer quote from einstein appear in `` science philosophy and religion a symposium '' publish by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life inc. new york 1941. in `` the more a man be imbue with the order regularity of all event the firmer becomes his conviction that there be no room left by the side of this order regularity for cause of a different nature for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists a an independent cause of natural event to be sure the doctrine of a personal god interfere with natural event could never be *refuted* italic his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domain in which scientific knowledge have not yet be able to set foot but i be convince that such behavior on the part of representative of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal for a doctrine which be to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose it effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress in their struggle for the ethical good teacher of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god that be give up that source of fear and hope which in the past place such vast power in the hand of priest in their labor they will have to avail themselves of those force which be capable of cultivate the good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself this be to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task ... '' `` it be of course a lie what you read about my religous conviction a lie which be be systematically repeat i do not believe in a personal god and i have never deny this but have express it clearly if something be in me which can be call religious then it be the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far a our science can reveal it '' the latter quote be from `` albert einstein the human side '' edit by helen dukas and banesh hoffman and publish by princeton university press also from the same book `` i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethic to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it '' of course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity do not in itself imply that christianity be false -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- subject everyone worship something typical post everyone worship something whether money power or god response if that be true everyone be a polytheist theist care just a much about those thing that atheist care about if the atheist reaction to for example their family amount to worship then so do the theist -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- subject why there must be a causeless cause typical post set of integer that have a low bound each have a small member so chain of cause must all have a first element a causeless cause response the set of real number great than zero have a definite low bound but have no small member far even if it be true that there must be a causeless cause that do not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favour by any particular religion -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- subject the universe be so complex it must have be design typical post the presence of design in the universe prof there be a god surely you think all this appear here just by chance response this be know a the argument from design it be a matter of dispute whether there be any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creature on the earth be evidence of a creator be best advise to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while there be insufficient space to summarize both side of that debate here however the conclusion be that there be no scientific evidence in favour of so-called scientific creationism furthermore there be much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexity of the universe and life on earth the origin of the argument by design be a feel that the existence of something a incredibly intricate a say a human be so improbable that surely it have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence direct thing so that human come from the chaos deliberately but if human intelligence be so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashion an entire universe complete with conscious being must be immeasurably more unlikely the approach use to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turn around and apply to the creationist position this lead u to the familiar theme of `` if a creator create the universe what create the creator `` but with the addition of spiral improbability the only way out be to declare that the creator be not create and just `` be '' or `` be '' from here we might a well ask what be wrong with say that the universe just `` be '' without introduce a creator indeed stephen hawk in his book '' a brief history of time '' explains his theory that the universe be close and finite in extent with no begin or end the argument from design be often state by analogy in the so-called watchmaker argument one be ask to imagine that one have found a watch on the beach do one assume that it be create by a watchmaker or that it evolve naturally of course one assumes a watchmaker yet like the watch the universe be intricate and complex so the argument go the universe too must have a creator the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaw over and above those common to all argument by design firstly a watchmaker creates watch from pre-existing material whereas god be claimed to have create the universe from nothing these two sort of creation be clearly fundamentally different and the analogy be therefore rather weak secondly a watchmaker make watch but there be many other thing in the world if we walk far along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we assume it be create by the watchmaker the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creator each responsible for a different part of creation finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch be not part of nature because it be order and therefore stand out from the randomness of nature yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe be obviously not random but show element of order the watchmaker argument be thus internally inconsistent -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- subject independent evidence that the bible be true typical post the event of the new testament be confirm by independent documentary evidence for example ... response the writing of josephus be often mention a independent documentary evidence early version of josephus 's work be thought not to

impossible for the bible to be both true and complete response godel 's first incompleteness theorem say that in any consistent formal system which be sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expression which can never be proven to be valid or invalid 'true or 'false within that formal system technically speak the system must also be recursive that be there must be a decision procedure for determine whether a give string be an axiom within the formal system essentially all such system can formulate what be know a a `` liar paradox '' the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english be `` this sentence be false '' note that if a proposition be undecidable the formal system can not even deduce that it be undecidable the logic use in theological discussion be rarely well define so claim that godel 's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it be impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god be worthless in isolation one can trivially define a formal system in which it be possible to prove the existence of god simply by have the existence of god state a an axiom this be unlikely to be view by atheist a a convincing proof however it may be possible to succeed in produce a formal system built on axiom that both atheist and theist agree with it may then be possible to show that godel 's incompleteness theorem hold for that system however that would still not demonstrate that it be impossible to prove that god exists within the system furthermore it certainly tell u anything about whether it be possible to prove the existence of god generally note also that all of these hypothetical formal system tell u nothing about the actual existence of god the formal system be just abstraction another frequent claim be that godel 's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever can not be both consistent and universally applicable religious text be not formal

b"my argument be mainly a proposal of what i think be a plausible argument against extra-marital sex -- one which i personally believe have some truth my main purpose for post it here be to show that a _plausible_ argument can be make against extra-marital sex at this stage i be not say that this particular viewpoint be proven or anything like that just that it be plausible to try to convince you all of this particular point of view i would probably have to do a lot of work research what have be do in this field etc. in order to gather far evidence which i simply do not have time to do now also note that i say that i think extra-marital sex be `` a prime cause '' in my opinion of the generally great level of psychological problem especially depression in western society i be not say it be `` the prime cause '' or `` the only cause '' just `` a prime cause '' -- i.e one of the significant contribution to this trend i think when you say you think my view be simplistic you have forgotten this -- i admit that there be probably other factor but i do think that extra-marital sex and imo subsequent destabilization of the family be a significant factor in the rise in psychological problem like depression in western society this century"

b"see we be disagree on the definition of moral here earlier you say that it must be a conscious act by your definition no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality you be try to apply human term to non-humans i think that even if someone be not conscious of an alternative this do not prevent his behavior from be moral i try to show it but by your definition it be show and morality can be thought of a large class of princples it could be define in term of many thing -- the law of physic if you wish however it seem silly to talk of a `` moral '' planet because it obeys the law of phyics it be less silly to talk about animal a they have at least some free will"
b"but you take into the account of propoganda remember if you ask german before wwii if the jew shoudl be slaughter they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine roll through at least some be able to tolerate it you see it only take a small group of fanatic to whip up a general frenzy well they manage to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the court but they have manage to create quite a few problem for people that want to have an abortion they could create similar problem for u and it could be bad they can try to stop abortion by block clinic etc. but imagine what have to do to stop atheism so you be able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them a whole nation yes be glad if it be go to never support it however i think that it be a minor problem that can be easily ignore contrast with what *could* happen an what may be likely well i be not clear on the religious conviction of francis scott key the motto can be attribute to him but it be at least clear that he believe in a god and surely there be a few christian that think a you say but i think that most do do you think that all christian actively despise other religion most that i have met and do so well i have ask a hindu moselem and a few jew and all of them think that it be applicable to them of course i say that these people just some that i know pretty well be accurate representation of their faith well really like to and try but i really know where to get access to _congressional records_ from the 1950 's can anyone help out here only in the sense that neither can probably convince to change their belief so be you say that they redesign the plate each year anyway your whole argument conveniently delete i see be that the motto somehow cost u all a lot of money this be just not correct that be to say the religion of this country and the non-religion of the ussr that be what most of those quote be about and some include all atheist in general a well i think that any of the quote although i seem to have lose them mention anything at all about jesus they advocate religion over non-religion a specific religion be not mention so you be say that all christian must believe that all other religion should be outlaw just because they think they be wrong silly i think the flat-earthers be wrong but i advocate their banishment i think that any such cost would be insignificant i mention the slight cost because you say that the motto be cost u a lot of money by be on our currency well motto in general really have purpose ... i think it should be remove because i think the benefit would be outweigh by the consequence then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress why not it be the majority that put it there but do they remember the debate surround the motto do they remember that some people intend it to be a message against atheist why you include this in your little survey that you be conduct ... what should i ask some scientist the probability that something einstein say about relativity be worthy i mean if einstein say it there 's a good chance that it be right at least at the time you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decision would be good evidence in favor of some point no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be present yes some mushroom can be plant and i appreciate mushroom on my pizza either who be force to put the motto there what do you mean"

b"archive-name atheism/logic alt-atheism-archive-name logic last-modified 5 april 1993 version 1.4 construct a logical argument although there be much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found be poor this article attempt to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improve the general level of debate logic be the science of reason proof think or inference concise oed logic allows u to analyze a piece of reason and determine whether it be correct or not valid or invalid of course one do not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic be often helpful when construct or analyze an argument note that no claim be be make here about whether logic be universally applicable the matter be very much open for debate this document merely explains how to use logic give that you have already decide that logic be the right tool for the job proposition or statement be the building block of a logical argument a proposition be a statement which be either true or false for example `` it be rain '' or `` today be tuesday '' proposition may be either assert say to be true or deny say to be false note that this be a technical meaning of `` deny '' not the everyday meaning the proposition be the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of word use to express it so `` god exists '' and `` there exists a god '' both express the same proposition an argument be to quote the monty python sketch `` a connect series of statement to establish a definite proposition '' an argument consists of three stage first of all the proposition which be necessary for the argument to continue be state these be call the premise of the argument they be the evidence or reason for accept the argument and it conclusion premise or assertion be often indicate by phrase such a `` because '' '' since '' `` obviously '' and so on the phrase `` obviously '' be often view with suspicion a it can be use to intimidate others into accept suspicious premise if something seem obvious to you be afraid to question it you can always say `` oh yes right it be obvious '' when heard the explanation next the premise be use to derive far proposition by a process know a inference in inference one proposition be arrive at on the basis of one or more other proposition already accepted there be various form of valid inference the proposition arrive at by inference may then be use in far inference inference be often denote by phrase such a `` implies that '' or '' therefore '' finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which be affirm on the basis of the premise and inference conclusion be often indicate by phrase such a `` therefore '' `` it follow that '' `` we conclude '' and so on the conclusion be often state a the final stage of inference for example every event have a cause premise the universe have a begin premise all beginning involve an event premise this implies that the begin of the universe involve an event inference therefore the universe have a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be call a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the term do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order give above for example the conclusion might be state first and the premise state afterwards in support of the conclusion this be perfectly valid if sometimes a little confuse recognize an argument be much harder than recognize premise or conclusion many people shower their write with assertion without ever produce anything which one might reasonably describe a an argument some statement look like argument but be not for example '' if the bible be accurate jesus must either have be insane an evil liar or the son of god '' this be not an argument it be a conditional statement it do not assert the premise which be necessary to support what appear to be it conclusion it also suffers from a number of other logical flaw but come to those later another example '' god create you therefore do your duty to god '' the phrase `` do your duty to god '' be not a proposition since it be neither true nor false therefore it be not a conclusion and the sentence be not an argument finally causality be important consider a statement of the form `` a because b '' if interested in establish a and b be offer a evidence the statement be an argument if try to establish the truth of b then it be not an argument it be an explanation for example '' there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start '' -- this be an argument `` my car will not start because there be something wrong with the engine '' -- this be an explanation there be two traditional type of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument be one which provide conclusive proof of it conclusion -- that be an argument where if the premise be true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument be either valid or invalid a valid argument be define a one where if the premise be true then the conclusion be true an inductive argument be one where the premise provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive argument be not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they be well or bad than other argument and about how probable their premise be there be form of argument in ordinary language which be neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive argument a they be often view a the most rigorous and convincing it be important to note that the fact that a deductive argument be valid do not imply that it conclusion hold this be because of the slightly counter-intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true proposition however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false proposition for example all insect have wing premise woodlouse be insect premise therefore woodlouse have wing conclusion here the conclusion be not true because the argument 's premise be false if the argument 's premise be true however the conclusion would be true the argument be thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premise a in all fish live in the sea premise dolphin be fish premise therefore dolphin live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we can not do be reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premise we can therefore draw up a `` truth table '' for implication the symbol `` '' denotes implication `` a '' be the premise `` b '' the conclusion `` t '' and `` f '' represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b a= b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- f f t if the premise be false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the premise be true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the premise be true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument be a valid argument whose premise be true a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid argument with sound argument to delve far into the structure of logical argument would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it be simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfall to be avoid when construct an argument these pitfall be know a fallacy in everyday english the term `` fallacy '' be use to refer to mistaken belief a well a to the faulty reason that lead to those belief this be fair enough but in logic the term be generally use to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appear valid or convincing so for the purpose of this discussion we define a fallacy a a logical argument which appear to be correct but which can be see to be incorrect when examine more closely by study fallacy we aim to avoid be mislead by them the follow list of fallacy be not intend to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force be commit when the arguer resort to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it be often use by politician and can be summarize a `` might make right '' the force threaten need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example '' ... thus there be ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell '' argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem be literally `` argument direct at the man '' the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of try to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attack the person or people make the assertion this be invalid because the truth of an assertion do not depend upon the goodness of those assert it for example '' atheism be an evil philosophy it be practise by communist and murderer '' sometimes in a court of law doubt be cast upon the testimony of a witness by show for example that he be a know perjurer this be a valid way of reduce the credibility of the testimony give by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it do not demonstrate that the witness's testimony be false to conclude otherwise be to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem be commit when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent 's particular circumstance for example '' it be perfectly acceptable to kill animal for food how can you argue otherwise when quite happy to wear leather shoe '' this be an abusive charge of inconsistency use a an excuse for dismiss the opponent 's argument this fallacy can also be use a a mean of reject a conclusion for example '' of course you would argue that positive discrimination be a bad thing white '' this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that one's adversary be rationalize a conclusion form from selfish interest be also know a `` poison the well '' argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium mean `` argument from ignorance '' this fallacy occurs whenever it be argue that something must be true simply because it have not be prove false or equivalently when it be argue that something must be false because it have not be prove true note that this be not the same a assume that something be false until it have be prove true a basic scientific principle example '' of course the bible be true nobody can prove otherwise '' `` of course telepathy and other psychic phenomenon do not exist nobody have show any proof that they be real '' note that this fallacy do not apply in a court of law where one be generally assume innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it be know that an event would produce certain evidence of it have occur the absence of such evidence can validly be use to infer that the event do not occur for example '' a flood a described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth do not have a tenth a much water even if we count that which be frozen into ice at the pole therefore no such flood occur '' in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something have not occur we can not conclude with certainty that it have not occur however argumentum ad misericordiam this be the appeal to pity also know a special plead the fallacy be commit when the arguer appeal to pity for the sake of get a conclusion accepted for example '' i do not murder my mother and father with an axe please find me guilty suffer enough through be an orphan '' argumentum ad populum this be know a appeal to the gallery or appeal to the people to commit this fallacy be to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appeal to a large group of people this form of fallacy be often characterize by emotive language for example '' pornography must be ban it be violence against woman '' `` the bible must be true million of people know that it be be you try to tell them that they be all mistaken fool '' argumentum ad numeram this fallacy be closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consists of assert that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it be that that proposition be correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority us the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example '' isaac newton be a genius and he believe in god '' this line of argument be not always completely bogus for example reference to an admit authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between '' stephen hawk have conclude that black hole give off radiation '' and '' john searle have conclude that it be impossible to build an intelligent computer '' hawk be a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinion on black hole radiation to be inform searle be a linguist so it be questionable whether he be well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident be commit when a general rule be apply to a particular case whose `` accidental '' circumstance mean that the rule be inapplicable it be the error make when one go from the general to the specific for example '' christian generally dislike atheist you be a christian so you must dislike atheist '' this fallacy be often commit by moralist and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically apply general rule converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy be the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occurs when one form a general rule by examine only a few specific case which be not representative of all possible case for example '' jim bakker be an insincere christian therefore all christian be insincere '' sweep generalization dicto simpliciter a sweep generalization occurs when a general rule be apply to a particular situation in which the feature of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweep generalization be the opposite of a hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these be know a false cause fallacy the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something a the cause of an event but it have not actually be show to be the cause for example '' i take an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappear so god cure me of the headache '' the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something be assume to be the cause of an event merely because it happen before the event for example '' the soviet union collapse after take up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reason '' cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy be similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it asserts that because two event occur together they must be causally related and leaf no room for other factor that may be the cause s of the event petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premise be at least a questionable a the conclusion reach circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes a a premise the conclusion which one wish to reach often the proposition will be rephrase so that the fallacy appear to be a valid argument for example '' homosexual must not be allow to hold government office hence any government official who be reveal to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexual will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexual can not be allow to hold government office '' note that the argument be entirely circular the premise be the same a the conclusion an argument like the above have actually be cite a the reason for the british secret service official ban on homosexual employee another example be the classic '' we know that god exists because the bible tell u so and we know that the bible be true because it be the word of god '' complex question fallacy of interrogation this be the fallacy of presupposition one example be the classic load question '' have you stop beating your wife '' the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which have not even be ask this trick be often use by lawyer in cross-examination when they ask question like '' where do you hide the money you stole '' similarly politician often ask load question such a '' how long will this ec interference in our affair be allow to continue '' or '' do the chancellor plan two more year of ruinous privatization '' ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claim that an argument support a particular conclusion when it be actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a christian may begin by say that he will argue that the teaching of christianity be undoubtably true if he then argues at length that christianity be of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have show that christian teaching be true sadly such fallacious argument be often successful because they arouse emotion which cause others to view the suppose conclusion in a more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when a key word be use with two or more different meaning in the same argument for example '' what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remains free that user can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable '' amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premise use in an argument be ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent be another form of fallacy through shift meaning in this case the meaning be change by alter which part of a statement be emphasize for example consider '' we should not speak ill of our friend '' and '' we should not speak ill of our friend '' fallacy of composition one fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property share by the part of something must apply to the whole for example '' the bicycle be make entirely of low mass component and be therefore very lightweight '' the other fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property of a number of individual item be share by a collection of those item for example '' a car us less petrol and cause less pollution than a bus therefore car be less environmentally damage than bus '' fallacy of division the fallacy of division be the opposite of the fallacy of composition like it opposite it exists in two variety the first be to assume that a property of some thing must apply to it part for example '' you be study at a rich college therefore you must be rich '' the other be to assume that a property of a collection of item be share by each item for example '' ant can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree '' the slippery slope argument this argument state that should one event occur so will other harmful event there be no proof make that the harmful event be cause by the first event for example '' if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare therefore we can not legalize marijuana '' `` a be base on b '' fallacy `` be a type of '' fallacy these fallacy occur when one attempt to argue that thing be in some way similar without actually specify in what way they be similar example '' history base upon faith if so then the bible also a form of history '' `` islam be base on faith christianity be base on faith so islam a form of christianity '' `` cat be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry dog be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry so dog a form of cat '' affirmation of the consequent this fallacy be an argument of the form `` a implies b b be true therefore a be true '' to understand why it be a fallacy examine the truth table for implication give earlier denial of the antecedent this fallacy be an argument of the form `` a implies b a be false therefore b be false '' again the truth table for implication make it clear why this be a fallacy note that this fallacy be different from non causa pro causa the latter have the form `` a implies b a be false therefore b be false '' where a do not in fact imply b at all here the problem be not that the implication be invalid rather it be that the falseness of a do not allow u to deduce anything about b. convert a conditional this fallacy be an argument of the form `` if a then b therefore if b then a '' argumentum ad antiquitam this be the fallacy of assert that something be right or good simply because it be old or because `` the way always be '' argumentum ad novitam this be the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it be the fallacy of assert that something be more correct simply because it be new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believe that money be a criterion of correctness that those with more money be more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assume that because someone be poor he or she be sounder or more virtuous than one who be wealthier this fallacy be the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam this be the incorrect belief that an assertion be more likely to be true the more often it be heard an `` argumentum ad nauseum '' be one that employ constant repetition in assert something bifurcation also refer to a the `` black and white '' fallacy bifurcation occurs when one present a situation a have only two alternative where in fact other alternative exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many question this fallacy occurs when a questioner demand a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a non-sequitur be an argument where the conclusion be drawn from premise which be not logically connect with it red herring this fallacy be commit when irrelevant material be introduce to the issue be discuss so that everyone 's attention be divert away from the point be make towards a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept be treat a a concrete thing shift the burden of proof the burden of proof be always on the person make an assertion or proposition shift the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium be the fallacy of put the burden of proof on the person who denies or question the assertion be make the source of the fallacy be the assumption that something be true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy be to misrepresent someone else 's position so that it can be attack more easily then to knock down that misrepresent position then to conclude that the original position have be demolish it be a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual argument that have be make the extend analogy the fallacy of the extend analogy often occurs when some suggest general rule be be argue over the fallacy be to assume that mention two different situation in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situation be analogous to each other this fallacy be best explain use a real example from a debate about anti-cryptography legislation '' i believe it be always wrong to oppose the law by break it '' `` such a position be odious it implies that you would not have support martin luther king '' `` be you say that cryptography legislation be a important a the struggle for black liberation how dare you '' tu quoque this be the famous `` you too '' fallacy it occurs when an action be argue to be acceptable because the other party have perform it for instance '' just be randomly abusive '' `` so be abusive too ''"

b"the number of civilian iraqi death be way over-exaggerated and exploit for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news medium the fact be that less iraqi die in the gulf war than do civilian in any other war of comparable size this century this be due mostly to the short duration couple with precise surgical bombing technique which be technically possible only recently the idea that `` hundred of thousand '' of iraqi citizen die be ludicrous not even `` hundred of thousand '' of iraqi soldier die and they be the one be target or do you think that the u and it ally be specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilian either the smart bomb hit their target and we know they do or they be target civilian target which be hardly condusive to destroy iraq 's military potential the military mission planner be not fool they know they have to hit *military* target to win a war hit civilian target do nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one want the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator how about all the innocent people who die in blanket-bombing in ww2 i hear you bemoan them war be never an exact science but with smart bomb become more exact with a small percentage of civilian casualty sometimes mistake be make target be misidentified innocent die war the way it really be but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictator to treat the earth like one big rummage sale grab everything they can get be bad like patrick henry say some 217 year ago `` i know not what course others may take -- but a for me give me liberty or give me death '' war be always the price one must be willing to pay if one wish to stay free mathew your sarcasm be note but you be completely off-base here you come off sound like a complete peace-nik idiot although i feel sure that be not your intent so the iraqi war be wrong eh sure that appeasement would have work well than war just like it do in ww2 eh i guess we have fought ww2 either -- just think of all those innocent german civilian kill in dresden and hamburg how about all the poor french who die in the crossfire because we invade the continent we should have just let hitler take over europe and be speak german instead of english right now tyrant like hussein *have* to be stop his kind understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret be that bush wimped out and have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein be still in power and the iraqi people 's sacrifice not to mention the 357 american who die be for naught liberate kuwait be a good thing but wipe hussein off the map would 've be well and a for poor poor rodney king do you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of `` not guilty '' those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no far than the video tape but the jury look at *all* the evidence evidence which you and i have not see when one make a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be present on both side one have simply lower himself to the level of vigilante justice a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policeman law in this country be intend to protect the right of the accuse whether they be criminal or cop one be not found guilty if there be a reasonable doubt of one 's guilt and only the jury be in a position to ass the evidence and render a verdict anyone else be simply succumb to verbal vigilantism regard"

b"there be a couple of thing about your post and others in this thread that be a little confuse an atheist be one for whom all thing can be understood a process of nature exclusively this definition do not include all atheist see the faq however i for one do think there be no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanation it make a big difference to claim that all thing can be understood a natural process and to claim that our observation do not require u to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter human be not omnipotent and neither be science however science have one advantage theology it be self- correct with nature a it judge it be delightful to see how scientific inquiry be reveal a self- consistent simple picture of our universe science be no longer a bunch of separate branch it be one from particle physic to psychology and no aspect of our life or our universe be safe from it stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there be no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there be no purpose or direction for any event beyond those require by physic chemistry biology etc everything be random nothing be determnined actually determinism vs. indeterminism be a philosophical question and science can not say whether the whole thing be actually somehow superdeterministic or not i think the question do not have any meaning a far a individual human being go if their apparent free will be an illusion it do not appear to be so from their perspective bill can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all it product there be nothing require that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence just a happy accident maybe who be we to tell it seem intelligence be useful when during the history of earth have _one species_ be able to control one third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of numerous happy accident our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserve even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the system that can start replicate will survive those which make it recommend reading t.o for an atheist no event can be prefer to another or be say to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought -about- an event can have value from whose perspective i value event and thing subjectively from my perspective nature do not have value because it do not have a perspective value arise from awareness if i have a subjective perspective it be easy to assume that other people also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule morality be not necessarily a gift from heaven in fact it may be a product of evolution perhaps we be aware of ourselves because a sense of identity be helpful allows u to play the role of others and make u respect others who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read aristotle try his ethica nikomakhea sp for starter how then can an atheist judge value what be the basis for criticize the value ennumerated in the bible or the purpose impute to god on what ground can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemn it seem that in judging the value that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct be measure but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your value c.s lewis tell u that this argument be the main reason why he abandon his atheism and become christian the argument be severely flaw some value such a the golden rule can have a rational basis some others like the basic idea of want to live have probably it root in the way our brain be wire lewis ignore the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality a well indeed a human evolve well and well in building and use tool they also become well at kill each other it be a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tool but not against one's own people the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jew be not beyond this a simple set of rule to hold the people together under one god their god do not care much about people of other nation at the time of the nt thing be quite different the jew be under rule of an _empire_ and could no longer simply ignore the gentile a new situation require a new morality and along with it a new religion be born a mutation in a meme pool since every event be entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- do religious or otherwise there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour be to admit that the objection be entirely subjective and that he she just like it it any value judgement must be preface by the disclaimer that it be nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carry no weight in any `` absolute '' sense it look like you bother to read philosophy whenever there be an observer there be a subjective point of view which may value it existence and happiness even if that be just a result of some physical event and other 's happiness too if the observer come to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that be without any observer or subject moral judgment lose their meaning it be not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this include god too their value be only _their_ personal judgment not absolute truth since such truth do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others be a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by become social being who can think and value others' existence morality be not property of human alone chimp dolphin and many other specie show great care for each other dolphin have sometimes save human from drown a good deed indeed that you like what god told people to do say nothing about god or god 's command it say only that there be an electrical event in your nervous system that create an emotional state that your mind couple with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction that your objection -seem- well found be due to the way be condition there be no `` truth '' content the whole of your intellectual landscape be an illusion a virtual reality the last statement do not logically follow in fact there be every reason to believe our thought can model reality very well and our sens can convey reliable information solipsism be still a logical possibility but not a very likely one you be continuously mix two different view the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view _which do not exist_ any observer or thinker any personal be have it own point of view it do not matter whether this point of view be a result of some physical event or not it do not cease to be subjective from a non-observers non-point of view value do not exist neither do pain or pleasure or beauty or love such thing be inherently subjective once again if god want wife to submit to their husband or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or want to punish u if we i disagree with his moral i do not think my moral come from any supreme be to remove my moral mean the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought if god give u morality to judge but i disagree with him it be not my fault he be free to replace my moral i can not see what be the point of give someone a moral system which disagrees with one's own and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this be so you have exclude yourself from any discussion of value right wrong goood evil etc and can not participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter i can not understand why a subjective opinion of a thing make of matter be in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing make of something else bill take note absolute value must be independent of _any_ be _including_ god if god have a subjective viewpoint it be his own point of view and his moral be his own petri"

code be once perfect and have degrade ever since we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement we perhaps the big `` imperfection '' of the code be that it be full of non-coding region intron which be so call because they intervene with the cod region exon an impressive amount of evidence suggests that intron be of very ancient origin it be likely that early exon represent early protein domain be the number of intron decrease or increase it appear that intron loss can occur and specie with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their gene on the other hand the possibility that intron have be insert later present several logical difficulty intron be remove by a splice mechanism this would have to be present but unused if intron be insert moreover intron insertion would have require _precise_ target random insertion would not be tolerate since sequence for intron removal self-splicing of mrna be conserve besides transposition of a sequence usually leaf a trace long terminal repeat and target site duplication and these be not found in or near intron sequence i seriously recommend reading textbook on molecular biology and

pose in a theological context why do god cause disease in newborn and my answer be likewise from a theological perspective -- my own it be no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective be support by the evidence whereas theological perspective often fail to fulfil this criterion i think you misread my meaning i say god make the genetic code perfect but that mean perfect now it have certainly evolve since for the bad would you please cite a few reference that support your assertion your assertion be less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it have be claimed that parasite and disease be perhaps more important than thought for instance sex might have evolve a defence against parasite this view be support by computer simulation of evolution eg tierra perhaps i thought it be high energy ray like x-ray gamma ray and cosmic ray that cause most of the damage in fact it be thermal energy that do most of the damage although it be usually mild and easily fix by enzymatic action actually neither of u `` know '' what the atmosphere be like at the time when god create life accord to my recollection most biologist do not claim that life begin 4 billion year ago -- after all that would only be a half billion year or so after the earth be create it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion year ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a well estimate replace `` create '' with `` form '' since there be no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be form without one most recent estimate of the age of the earth range between 4.6 4.8 billion year and early sign of life not true fossil but organic stromatolite-like layer date back to 3.5 billion year this would leave more than billion year for the first cell to evolve sorry i give any reference this be base on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attend here dominion it be no great feat for satan to genetically engineer disease both bacterial/viral and genetic although the force of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence for this suppose `` degeneration '' i can understand scott 's reaction excuse me but this be so far-fetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what pathogen be do you know what point mutation be do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it a fact but you can not *know* that i hope you forget this we have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one do not have to _believe_ in anything it be a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk be to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one 's own conclusion prior to this theology do not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusion human dna be more `` complex '' tends to accumulate error adversely affect our well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and virus tend to become more efficient in cause infection and disease it be a bad combination hence we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases/disorders you be suppose a purpose not a valid move bacteria and virus do not exist to cause disease they be just another manifest of a general principle of evolution only replication save replicators from degradiation we be just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient method make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human dna be degrade through evolutionary process some people have claimed that the opposite be true we have suppress our selection and thus be bound to degrade i see much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where be this relevant to my discussion in answer john 's question of why why be there genetic disease and why be there so many bacterial and viral disease which require baby to develop antibody be it god 's fault the original question -- i say no it be not of course nothing `` evil '' be god 's fault but your explanation do not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact be that you know that satan be not responsible and neither do i. suppose that a powerful evil be like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ill that affect mankind i think so he could have do a much well job pun intend the problem be it seem no satan be necessary to explain any disease they be just a inevitable a any product of evolution do i say that where seem to me like another bad inference actually what do be to oversimplify what i say to the point that your summary of my word take on a new context i never say that people be `` meant '' presumably by god `` to be punish by get disease '' why i do say be that free moral choice have attendent consequence if mankind chooses to reject god a people have do since the begin then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse event in an entropic universe i be not expect this if god exists i expect him to leave u alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choice be indeed free this be an interest philosophical question and the answer be not a clear-cut a it seem to be what consequence would you expect from reject allah oh i admit not perfect yet but work on it a good library or a bookstore be a good start point what do this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provide an answer biology and genetics be fine subject and important scientific endeavor but they explain *how* god create and set up life process they explain the why behind creation life or it subsequent evolution why be there a `` why behind '' and your proposition be something that be not support by the evidence this be why we recommend these book be there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention a recent cosmological theory hawk et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but i be not highly motivate to learn all the nitty-gritty detail of biology and genetics although sure find it a fascinate subject for i realize that the detail do not change the big picture that god create life in the begin with the ability to change and adapt to it environment sorry but they do there be no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that be capable of adaptation it can come into existence

b"this book be worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue the book be in two section section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the bible show many inconsistency between the bible and modern science well we all know that no surprise section 2 analysis the koran 's version of the old testament story and seem on the face of it to present a good case show the koran be consistent with modern science however it be plain to me that this consistency be only possible by the vague phraseology of the koran take the flood for example the bible be full of detail `` forty day and forty night '' `` pair of every animal '' etc we all know this be nonsense the koran 's description of the same event be so obscure a to make possible an interpretation such a `` a big river flood for a few day and cause much damage '' yes no contradiction but also not much fact the koran might be consistent with modern science but be consistent due to it vagueness compare with other book of that time do not seem much of an achievement the book concludes by say something like the koran must have have divine inspiration because at the time it be write there be a lot of to u now ridiculous idea about the universe and none of them can be found in the koran argue for the greatness of a book by talk about what it do not contain seem absurd in the extreme the above be of course from memory so i may have miss some point --"

b"okay ... i argue this thoroughly about 3-4 week ago men and woman be different ... physically physiologically and psychologically much recent evidence for this statement be present in the book `` brainsex '' by anne moir and david jessel i recommend you find a copy and read it their book be an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and be well reference now if woman and men be different in some way the law can only adequately take into account their need in these area where they be different by also take into account the way in which men and woman be different maternity leave be an example of this -- it take into account that woman get pregnant it do not give woman the same rule it would give to men because to treat woman like it treat men in this instance would be unjust this be just simply an obvious example of where men and woman be intrinsically different now people make the _naive_ argument that sexism oppression however maternity leave be sexist because men do not get pregnant men do not have the same access to leave that woman do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it be sexist no matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can and therefore the law be sexist no man can have access to maternity leave no matter how hard he try to get pregnant i hope this be clear maternity leave be an example where a sexist law be just because the sexism here just reflect the `` sexism '' of nature in make men and woman different there be many other difference between men and woman which be far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book `` brainsex '' your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant be fallacious if men can one day become pregnant it will be by have biologically become woman to have a womb and the other factor require for pregnancy be usually wrap up in the definition of what a woman be -- so your argument when it be examine be see to be fallacious you be say that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that woman can have if they also become woman -- which actually just support my statement that maternity leave be sexist there be no official priesthood in islam -- much of this function be take by islamic scholar there be female islamic scholar and female islamic scholar have always exist in islam an example from early islamic history be the prophet 's widow aisha who be recognize in her time and be recognize in our time a an islamic scholar you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religion and i dispute it i could go on and on about woman in islam etc. but i recently reposted something here under the head `` islam and woman '' -- if it be still at your news-site i suggest you read it it be reposted from soc.religion.islam so if it have disappear from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam i forgot what it original title be though i will email it to you if you like your statement that `` other religion be no different '' be i think a statement base simply on lack of knowledge about religion other than christianity and perhaps judaism aisha who i mention earlier be not only an islamic scholar but also be at one stage a military leader the prophet 's first wife who die just before the `` hijra '' the prophet 's journey from mecca to medina be a successful businesswoman lucio you can not make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint be base on ignorance about world religion"

b"right and this be pretty impossible right it would be ideal if we could believe for a while just to try out religion and only then determine which course of thought suit u best but again this be not possible not that religion warrant belief but the belief carry with it some psychological benefit there be also some psychological burden too well if there be some psychological or other benefit gain from racism they could only be fully understood or judged by person actually `` believe '' in racism of course the parallel happens to be a poor one but you originate it"

b"trh i hope not go to flame him please give him the same coutesy you' trh ve give me but you have be courteous and therefore receive courtesy in return this person instead have post one of the bad argument i have ever see make from the pro-christian people know several jesuit who would laugh in his face if he present such an argument to them let 's ignore the fact that not a true trilemma for the moment nice word maddi original or be it a real word and concentrate on the liar lunatic part the argument claim that no one would follow a liar let alone thousand of people look at l. ron hubbard now he be probably not all there but i think he be mostly a liar and a con-artist but look at how many thousand of people follow dianetics and scientology i think the baker 's and swaggert along with several other televangelist lie all the time but look at the number of follower they have a for lunatic the best example be hitler he be obviously insane his advisor certainly thought so yet he have a whole country entralled and come close to ruling all of europe how many german give their life for him to this day he have his follower just amaze that people still try to use this argument just so obviously *wrong*"
b"i jim i always thought that homophobe be only a word use at act up rally i beleive real people use it let 's see if we agree on the term 's definition a homophobe be one who actively and militantly attack homosexual because he be actually a latent homosexual who us his hostility to conceal his true orientation since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality be a homophobe your implication be clear it must necessarily follow that all men be latent homosexual or bisexual at the very least crap crap crap crap crap a definition of any type of 'phobe come from phobia an irrational fear of hence a homophobe not only in act up meeting the word be apparently in general use now or perhaps it in the bible wouldst thou prefer if i be to communicate with thou in bilespeak do an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of be a spider do an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of be a wide open space do you understand english obviously someone who have phobia will react to it they will do their best to avoid it and if that be not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashings occur because of natural process people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence that what i say ... what be you take issue with here your remark be merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful ... it would seem odd if homosexuality have any evolutionary function other than limit population growth since evolution only occurs when the member of one generation pas along their trait to subsequent generation homosexuality be an evolutionary deadend if i take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all men be really homosexual and evolution of our specie at least be go nowhere so *every* time a man have sex with a woman they intend to produce child hmm ... no wonder the world be overpopulate obviously you keep to the monty python song `` every sperm be sacred '' and if a *you* say it have a purpose a a mean to limit population growth then it be by your own arguement natural consider the context talk about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirement of evolution be that member of a specie procreate those who have no purpose in that context another point be that if the offspring of each generation be to survive the participation of both parent be necessary a family must exist since homosexual do not reproduce they can not constitute a family since the majority of humankind be part of a family homosexuality be an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will well if that be true by your own arguements homosexual would have vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation also the parent from single parent family should put the baby out in the cold now co they must by your arguement die by your argument homosexuality be genetically determine a to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context mean i be talk about evolution the preservation of the specie the fundamental premise of the whole process but it get bad since the overwhelm majority of people actually -prefer- a heterosexual relationship homosexuality be a social abberation a well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family but wait there's more read the above i expect you to have at least ten child by now with the family grow these day sex be less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no-one but more to do with pleasure in pre-pill and pre-condom day if you have sex there be the chance of produce child these day be just ai n't true people can decide whether or not to have child and when soon they will be able to choose sex c but another arguement ... so more of a `` lifestyle '' decision again by your arguement since homosexual can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not child both be a `` unnatural '' a each other yet another non-sequitur sex be an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it be also recreation be incidental that homosexual procreate mean that sex be -only- recreation and nothing more they serve no -evolutionary- purpose since homosexual have come out the closet and have convince some policy maker that they have civil right they be now claim that their sexuality be a preference a life-style an orientation a choice that should be protect by law now if homosexuality be a mere choice and if it be both contrary to nature and anti-social then it be a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they become prominent people be people be people who be you to tell anyone else how to live their life be you god tm if so fancy a date here 's pretty obvious dodge do you really think say anything or do you just feel obligate to respond to every statement i be not tell anyone anything i be demonstrate that there be argument against the practice of homosexuality provide a merely an alternate lifestlye that be not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand i realize of course that this come dangerously close to establish a value and that atheist be compel to object on that basis but if you be to be consistent you have no case in this regard to characterize any opposition to homosexuality a homophobic be to ignore some very compelling argument against the legitimization of the homosexual `` life-style '' but since the charge be only intend to intimidate really just demogoguery and not to be take seriously fact be jim there be far more persuasive argument for suppress homosexuality than those give but consider this a start again crap all your argument be base on outdated ideal likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generation spawn by a `` bastard '' to eternal damnation or someone who crush his penis either accidently or not.. both be in deuteronomy sure your comment pertains to something but disguise it so well i see what where do i mention ideal out-dated or otherwise your argument be very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute a to why homosexual should be exclude from participation in scout the reason be the same a those use to restrict them from teach by their own logic homosexual be deviate social and biological since any adult be a role model for a child it be incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child harm in this case harm mean primarily social though that could be extend easily enough you show me *anyone* who have sex in a way that everyone would describe a normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you `` one man 's meat be another man 's poison '' what have this get to do with anything would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain your objection i would really like to believe that you can discus this issue intelligibly"
