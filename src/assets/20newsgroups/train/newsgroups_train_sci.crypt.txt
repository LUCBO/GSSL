b"that sound like an old _dragnet_ episode `` joe and i go to the apartment of prime suspect nobody answer the door but his landlord give u permission to search the apartment '' perhaps that work in california in the 60 's but a i understand the law landlord do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space rent by a third party provide the lease be not in default etc not even sure if they can provide the master key when show a search warrant since the _subject_ of the search be suppose to be notify at this point the question becomes do the user `` rent '' the disk space her encrypt file occupies if she do it _should_ fall under the same body of case law that applies to apartment storage locker etc a to whether any court would recognize this fact ... if she do not i.e. no compensation exchange i know how it would be treat -- there seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent"

b"an article from comp.org.eff.news effector online 5.06 carl april 16 1993 initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today make a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of million of american the first part of the plan be to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communication privacy issue such a export control which have effectively deny most people easy access to robust encryption a well a law enforcement issue pose by new technology however eff be very concerned that the administration have already reach a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion have be allow apparently the administration be go to use it leverage to get all telephone equipment vendor to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the national security agency the so-called `` clipper chip '' be an 80-bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chip manufacture by a military contractor two separate escrow agent would store user key and be require to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme use be to be classify but they chip will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their communication product this proposal raise a number of serious concern first the administration appear to be adopt a solution before conduct an inquiry the nsa-developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product other vendor or developer may have well scheme furthermore we should not rely on the government a the sole source for clipper or any other chip rather independent chip manufacturer should be able to produce chipsets base on open standard second an algorithm can not be trust unless it can be test yet the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classify eff believe that any standard adopt ought to be public and open the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that be open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the split-key dual-escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement need the detail of this scheme must be explore publicly before it be adopt what will give people confidence in the safety of their key do disclosure of key to a third party waive individual 's fifth amendment right in subsequent criminal inquiry in sum the administration have show great sensitivity to the importance of these issue by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security however the `` clipper chip '' solution ought to be consider a part of the inquiry not be adopt before the discussion even begin detail of the proposal escrow the 80-bit key will be divide between two escrow agent each of whom hold 40 bit of each key upon presentation of a valid warrant the two escrow agent would have to turn the key part over to law enforcement agent most likely the attorney general will be ask to identify appropriate escrow agent some in the administration have suggest one non-law enforcement federal agency perhaps the federal reserve and one non-governmental organization but there be no agreement on the identity of the agent yet key registration would be do by the manufacturer of the communication device a key be tie to the device not to the person use it classify algorithm and the possibility of back door the administration claim that there be no back door mean by which the government or others could break the code without secure key from the escrow agent and that the president will be told there be no back door to this classify algorithm in order to prove this administration source be interested in arrange for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap door the result of the investigation would then be make public government a market driver in order to get a market move and to show that the government believe in the security of this system the fed will be the first big customer for this product user will include the fbi secret service vp al gore and maybe even the president from more information contact jerry berman executive director daniel j. weitzner senior staff counsel"
b'actually many of u have note this we have note that the program start at least 4 year ago that the contract with vlsi technology and microtoxin be let at least 14 month ago that production of the chip be well underway and so forth nobody i know have claimed clinton intitiated the program but he chose to go ahead with it perhaps the nsa realise that *no-one* would even contemplate fall for the dual-escrow bluff while under the bush administration and *had* to wait for a democrat govt to con into promote this because people *might* just believe they be honest work do it'

mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time _____ 8.2 what be the responsibility associate with anonymity user -- -- use anonymity only if you have to frivolous us weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others do not hide behind anonymity to evade establish convention on usenet such a post binary picture to regular newsgroups if post large file be attentive to bandwidth consideration remember simply send the post to the service increase network traffic avoid post anonymously to the regular hierarchy of usenet this be the mostly likely place to alienate reader the alt' hierarchy be prefer give a much information a possible in the post i.e reference etc remember that content be the only mean for reader to judge the truth of the message and that any inaccuracy will tend to discredit the entire message and even future one under the same handle be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it test the system by send anonymized mail to yourself be aware of the policy of the anonymous site and respect them be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege be considerate and respectful of other 's objection to anonymity `` hit-and-run '' anonymity should be use with utmost reservation use service that provide anonymous return address instead be courteous to the system operator who may have invest large amount of time be personally risk his account or dedicate his hardware all for your convenience operator -- -- -- -- document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable us in an introductory file that be sent to new user have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it state clearly what log and monitoring be occur describe your background interest and security measure will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz-faire formulate a plan for problematic ethical situation and anticipate potentially intense moral quandary and dilemma what if a user be blackmailing someone through your service what if a user post suicidal message through your service remember your user trust you to protect them in the site introductory note give clear example of situation where you will take action and what these action will be e.g warn the user limit anonymity to email or post only revoke the account 'out the user contact local administrator etc describe exactly the limitation of the software and hardware address the bandwidth limitation of your site report candidly and thoroughly all bug that have occur work closely with user to isolate and fix bug address all bug note below under `` in stability of anonymity '' document the stability of the site -- -how long have it be run what compromise have occur why be you run it what be your commitment to it include a disclaimer in outgo mail and message include an address for complaint ideally append to every outgo item consult a lawyer about your liability be commit to the long-term stability of the site be prepared to deal with complaint and hate mail address to you if you do not own the hardware the system run on or be not the system adminstrator consult those who do and be be considerate of provide anonymity to various group if possible query group reader keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgo message format that can be screen effectively by kill file ensure the key text anon be somewhere in every header take precaution to ensure the security of the server from physical and network-based attack and infiltration reader -- -- -- do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he be post anonymously make blanket condemnation that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reason e.g it volume be heavy or increase react to the anonymous information unemotionally abusive poster will be encourage far if they get irrationally irate response sometimes the most effective response be silence notify operator if very severe abuse occur such a piracy harassment extortion etc do not complain about posting be inappropriate because they offend you personally use kill file to screen anonymous posting if you object to the idea of anonymity itself avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous posting should be bar from particular group because no possible or conceivable need exists reference -- -- -- -- -- see e.g ftp.eff.org /pub/academic/anonymity this article be an excerpt from an issue of fidonews on individual privacy and the use of handle it accepts the need of a system operator to know the name of a user but suggests that the use of a handle be analogous to a request to withhold the name in a letter to the editor the article concludes with a set of guideline for preserve the right to be anonymous _____ 8.3 how do i kill anonymous posting james thomas green jgreen zeus.calpoly.edu try put this in your kill file /anon/h j /anonymous/h j this will search the header of the message and kill any that contain anon or anonymous in them not perfect and kill followup note that anonymous server operator have the capability to mask anonymous posting under which the above method will not work so far this practice be not widespread but it may become more common a a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filter _____ 8.4 what be the history behind anonymous post server originally anonymous post service be introduce for individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity be almost the prefer method of communication such a talk.abortion and alt.sex.bondage one of the first be one by dave mack start in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage another early one be wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by stephanie gilgut gilgut enterprise but be disband due to lack of fund the system provide anonymous return address n7kbt.rain.com john opalko take up the function of this server include reinstate the anonymous alias file the group `` alt.personals have be chew through server like there 's no tomorrow '' spur by the disappearance of wizvax and interested in research the idea karl kleinpaste karl_kleinpaste godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu developed his own system from scratch in six hour by this time the idea of extend the server to new more mainstream group be start to emerge and he explore the possibility partly at the specific request by multiple user for anonymity in other group `` the intend advantage of my system be specifically to allow multiple group support with a single anon identifier across all this be arguably the single big deficiency of previous anon system '' k. kleinpaste post a message on rec.nude ask user whether an anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus against it k. kleinpaste introduce what he call a `` fire extinguisher '' to squelch or plonk abusive user in response to complaint and use this in three case nevertheless after a few month of intense traffic he be eventually overwhelmed by the abuse of his server `` even a restrict a it be my system be subject to abuse to the point where it be order dismantle by the facility staff here such abuse start right after it be create '' in ~nov 1992 johan helsingius julf penet.fi set up the most controversial anonymous site to date anon.penet.fi be base on script and c code write by k. kleinpaste and support anonymized mail post and return address he initially want to confine the service to scandinavian user but expand it to worldwide accessability in response to 'lots of international request j. helsingius policy of allow anonymous post to every usenet newsgroup have be met with strong and serious ideological opposition e.g by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium abuse by anonymous poster tend to have high visibility than `` routine '' abuse his total commitment to preservation of anonymity be also controversial for example in a highly controversial and publicize case in ~feb 1993 an anonymous user post a suppose transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the challenger shuttle disaster via anon.penet.fi to sci.astro despite that the transcript have be post in the same place up to a year earlier then non-anonymously and actually originate not with the poster but a new york news tabloid subsequent response consist largely of vociferous outrage at the poster 's use of anonymity reverberate through many newsgroups the original poster use the same anonymous handle later concede that the story `` seem likely to have be fabricate '' suggest the plausible possibility that the original intent be not to provoke outrage but gauge reaction on the authenticity of the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceive association with the item the ensue commotion generate query for the original article by late-entering reader the anonymous user later post deliberately offensive comment at his detractor despite piercingly irate and outrage complaint and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of k. kleinpaste and eminent news operator j. helsingius have largely avoid use of the `` fire extingisher '' and the `` group bouncer '' mechanism that limit the scope of the service a of ~march 1993 the anon.penet.fi site be best described a inundate it have register over 13,000 user in it initial three month of operation forward ~3000 message a day and approximately 5 of all usenet posting be anonymized through the site the immense popularity be probably largely due to the capability for global anonymity which have allow user to find creative us in diverse area not previously envision johan helsingius have be subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in ~feb 1993. at one point k. kleinpaste threaten publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operator to send out revocation command on all message originate from the site j. helsingius have also allude to threat of flood the server the server have crashed several time at least once due to a saturation mailbombing through it by an anonymous user mr. helsingius report spending up to 5 hour per day answer email request alone associate with the service 's administration in response to the serious threat he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encourage his user to defend the service publicly base on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestion by `` cypherpunks '' j. helsingius have identify many security weakness and valuable new feature for the service and be currently in the process of code development and test he be planning on upgrade the ibm compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon to handle the voluminous load and be consider integrate a new system with very sophisticated functionality include multiple email alias alias allocation control public-key encryption etc a very sophisticated anonymous post system be set up in dec. 1992 by d. clunie dclunie pax.tpa.com.au that use cryptography in both direction to/from the server for the high degree of confidentiality see so far however it be run on a public access account and he have to shut it down after only several week upon receive request and condition apparently ultimately originate from nsf representative d. clunie have release the software to the public domain recently the idea of a newsgroup devote to whistleblowing on government abuse have receive wide and focus attention and group formation be currently underway in the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously use remailers and even establish reputation base on their authentifiable digital signature the traffic may eventually reach reporter in the mainstream news medium deltorto aol.com have volunteer to attack multiple aspect of this project include distribute easy-to-read documentation on post anonymization and encryption see also section on `` view on anonymous post '' below and `` what be go on with anon.penet.fi '' in this document thanks to carl kleinpaste karl_kleinpaste godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu david clunie dclunie pax.tpa.com.au and johan helsingius julf penet.fi for contribution here _____ 8.5 what be the value of anonymity kondared purccvm.bitnet i think anonymous post do help in focus our attention on the content of one 's message sure lot of anonymous post be abusive or frivolous but in most case these be by user who find the anon facility novel once the novelty wear off they be stop their prank ... morgan engr.uky.edu wes morgan i mind see the miscellaneous hatred/prejudice/racism those thing be part of our nature however the notion of provide anonymity 's shield for these idea repulse me if they have such strong feeling why they put their name s on their posting ... quite frankly i loathe communication with people who refuse to use their name dclunie pax.tpa.com.au david clunie many seem to question the value of anonymity but who be they to say what risk another individual should take there be no question that in this rather conservative society that we live in hold certain view make certain statement adopt a certain lifestyle be likely to result in public censure ridicule loss of status employment or even legal action give the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdiction from where the many contributor to usenet post who know what be legal and what be not some say that anonymous poster be `` coward '' and should stand up and be count perhaps that be one point of view but what right do these detractor have to exercise such censorship from doug cc.ysu.edu doug sewell why be it censorship to not expect someone to speak for themselves without the cloak of anonymity this be at best a lame argument you tell me why what you have to say require anonymity and you tell me why the wish of a majority of non-anonymous user of a newsgroup should be disregard when they want anonymous post anonymous user have less right than any others they be not legitimate usenet participant i would not honor rfd cfvs control message or vote from one brad clarinet.com brad templeton i can think of no disadvantage cause by anon post site that already exist other than the fact that they do make more naive net user who know how to post anonymously the old way more prone to do it from mandel netcom.com tom mandel i can not speak for others but i regard anonymous posting in a serious discussion a pretty much worthless ... view that hide behind the veil of anon be hardly worth the trouble of reading n8729 anon.penet.fi hank pankey since i begin post anonymously to show support for general principle of personal privacy i have be subject to far more abuse and attack than i ever receive before people seem to find it easy to flame and insult someone whose name they know perhaps easy to pretend that there be no person behind the email address who feel the sting of abusive comment anonymity do hinder some method of control other posters' action people who seek such control will naturally oppose it from 00acearl leo.bsuvc.bsu.edu instead of make this a `` free-er medium '' by allow poster to `` protect themselves '' with anonymity simply require that all poster be prepared to discus their source of information and take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble this seem to be the way thing be currently do xtkmg trentu.ca kate gregory in misc.kids there be three thread go on start by anonymous poster one be about change job so a to work less hour job share and so on from a woman who want anyone at her current place of work to know she be think of look for work elsewhere the next be from a woman who be think of have a baby sometime soon and want coworkers friend family etc etc to know all about it but who want advice the third be about sex after parenthood -- actually this be start by people post in the usual way but then it be point out that the anonymous post service might let more people participate misc.kids seem to be suffer any harm from the presence of anonymous poster in fact it seem to have be help by it hoey zogwarg.etl.army.mil dan hoey while there have never be any real security against anonymous or forge posting on usenet the process have until now be sufficiently inconvenient error-prone and undocumented to limit it use by person who have not learn the culture of the net on the other hand a recent use of the anonymous post service on sci.math seem seem to be a student ask help on a homework problem it have now be attribute to a teacher ask for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teach guide he say his news post be broken so he be use the anonymous service a a mail-to-news gateway karl barrus elee9sf menudo.uh.edu some argue that the opinion of the people who hide behind a veil of anonymity be worthless and that people should own up to their thought i agree with the latter point in an ideal world we would all be sit around engage in socratic dialogue freely exchange our opinion in an effort to learn but in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for your thought or ridicule you but we live in a world where the people who agree with you may try to harm you let 's face it some people go to agree with your opinion no matter how logically you try to present it or how reason out it may be this be sad since it do restrict people from voice their opinion red redpoll.neoucom.edu richard e. depew the consensus seem to be that a general anonymous post service such a that at anon.penet.fi seem sufficiently corrosive of the trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment should be end perhaps the next time the question come up we can say `` we try it we learn it do more harm than good and we stop it '' from c96 vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de alexander eichener anonymous post have not create major problem aside from anger irate people like you who would rather ban anonymous/pseudonymous post altogether because `` real men can stand up for what they say '' or comparable puerile argument a others have brought up dave elxr.jpl.nasa.gov dave hayes what a primal example of human nature i have three question for you folk do people really say different thing to each other base upon whether their identity be or know be people really so affected by what other people say that the verbage be label `` abuse '' most importantly on a forum that prize itself on the freedom of communication that it enjoys be there really such a thing a freedom of communication from terry geovision.gvc.com terry mcgonigal sigh ... just how many anon service be need will *everybody* start run one soon what 's the purpose who stand to benefit when there be n anon service then 2*n then n^2 out there where *has* this sudden fasination with anon service come from for well or imho bad it look like we'er gon na get stuck with these thing and a much a i like the idea of service like this become the norm i really think there 's much to be do since obvious that anyone who want to can set one up with a bit of work karl_kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu karl kleinpaste weak reason with freedom come responsibility dave elxr.jpl.nasa.gov dave hayes responsibility real if it be enforce true responsibilty come with no coercion _____ 8.6 should anonymous post to all group be allow morgan engr.uky.edu wes morgan i will be the first to admit that i hold some controversial opinion indeed sure that none of u be completely orthodox in our opinion however receive *hundreds* of anonymous email message over the last few year few than 20 of them be `` reasonable post make with good motif '' get more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity at all the abuser be once again lousing thing up for those who truly need the service or those who would put it to good use not suggest that we should ban anonymous server a say there be several situation in which anonymity be a good thing tm however the notion that anonymity 's shield should be automatically extend to every usenet discussion be ridiculous it open the door to far abuse twpierce unix.amherst.edu tim pierce of course how do one determine whether a `` group '' request the service a flat majority of poster voting in favor a positive margin of 100 vote or what no one speaks for a newsgroup not convince by the argument that an anonymous post service for all newsgroups be inherently a bad idea simply because a diversion from the status quo since the status quo previously permit anonymous post to *no* newsgroups any anonymous post service would reject the status quo it be facist to suggest that a newsgroup be best able to decide whether it want to allow anonymous posting instead of have them force upon them by an service administrator ogil quads.uchicago.edu brian w. ogilvie the service provide a mechanism for forward mail to the original poster since most usenet reader know john smith from jane doe except by their opinion and their address the effect of have an anonymous post to which mail reply can be direct be minimal except for those who personally know the poster -- and ... the lack of anonymity could be serious any mechanism like this be liable to abuse but the benefit a well a the cost must be weigh limit the service to alt group or specific group would not help those who want advice on sensitive issue in more 'professional newsgroups from tarl sw.stratus.com tarl neustaedter an additional point be that some of u find anonimity in technical matter to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forum have different meaning if i get a phone call from someone who identify himself i hang up if i get u.s. mail with no return address it go into the garbage unopened if someone accosts me in the street while wear a mask i back away carefully and expect violence in a technical discussion anonimity mean that the individual willing to associate himself with the matter be discuss which discredit his utterance and make listen to them a waste of time anonimity lead to fun psych experiment the literature be fill with all the various thing that people will do anonymously that they otherwise include one notorious study involve torture that would not have pass today 's ethical standard fun stuff in any case fine leave u out of it from jbuck forney.berkeley.edu joe buck you obviously have never submit an article to a refereed journal where you will receive anonymous review through a server the editor that behaves much like the one in finland e.g you may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity ... your comparison of someone who want to express him/herself on a technical issue anonymously with a person who approach you on a dark street with a ski mask be just emotionally overwrought nonsense such poster pose no physical threat to you jik mit.edu j. kamens it seem obvious to me that the default should be *not* to allow anonymous posting in a newsgroup the usenet have always operate on the principle that the status quo should be kept unless there 's a large number of people who want to change it if someone really need to post a message anonymous in a newsgroup in which this usually do they can usually find someone on the net to do this for them they need an automate service to do it and the automate service be by it nature incapable of make the judgment call necessary to decide whether a particular post really need to be anonymous from twpierce unix.amherst.edu tim pierce for any newsgroup you name i bet i can envision a scenario involve a need for secrecy if an accurate content-based filter of each anonymous post could be devise to screen out those that require secrecy wonderful but it be do from lhp daimi.aau.dk lasse hiller|e petersen if a newsgroup want to be noise- and nuisance-free then it should call for moderation this should happen on a per-newsgroup basis and not a a general usenet ban on anonymous posting of course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all anonymous posting and could be achieve automatically it would still be _moderation_ personally i would prefer moderation criterion be base on actual content david a. clunie dclunie pax.tpa.com.au if a `` group '' want to receive certain post it should become moderate there be clearly define mechanism on non-alt group for this to take place an automate moderator exclude post from certain eg anonymous site or individual could easily be establish if anyone want to take such a draconian approach then they be welcome to do so and good luck to them i doubt if i will be reading their group from dave frackit.uucp dave ratcliffe what possible need would someone have for post anonymously to a sci group sure most adult be willing to post under their own name why would they want to hide behind an anonymous post service ashamed of what they have to say or just try to rile people without fear of be identify anonymous post have their place in certain group if i or anyone else need to tell you what those group be then be on another planet breathing exotic gas for too long from karl_kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu bloody fascinate that all the proponent of unimpeded universal anon post access seem to find any middle ground at all why be there such a perception of absolutism where do this instant gratification syndrome come from `` i want anon access and i want it now '' who be the control freak here from 00acearl leo.bsuvc.bsu.edu remember this be a newsgroup for poster write about scientific issue anonymous discussion of scientific issue lead to bad science from noring netcom.com jon noring though many have personal philosophical argument against anonymous poster their argument have not be compelling enough to convince me that omni-newsgroup anonymous post should be ban or severely restrict though i can not prove it it seem to me that those who do not like anonymous post in principle do so for reason that be personal read psychological discomfort rather than for reason related to maintain the `` integrity '' of usenet remember it be impossible to be able to ascertain all the conceivable and legitimate motif for anonymous post to newsgroups one normally would not deem to be `` sensitive '' ... in general i fear even let newsgroup reader vote on either allow or not allow anonymous post since a priori they can not know all the motif of *legitimate* poster and i do not believe that any system should ever be institute that would inhibit the post of legitimate and informative post i personally believe that pseudonymous posting be appropriate in a serious discussion area if there be a legitimate reason for conceal the poster identity perhaps but simply because not so sure if they want their name attach qualify a legitimate in my book oh and if you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous posting please enlighten me sderby crick.ssctr.bcm.tmc.edu stuart p. derby three of our the u.s. 's found father madison hamilton and jay seem to think `` anonymous post '' be ok. the federalist paper be originally print in new york newspaper with authorship attribute to `` publius '' i wonder if you would find their purpose `` legitimate '' _____ 8.7 what should system operator do with anonymous posting from emcguire intellection.com ed mcguire i would like to know how to junk all article post by the anonymous service currently be discuss ideally i would actually tell my feed site not to feed me article post by the anonymous service assume the c news performance release what be a simple way to accomplish this or where should i look to learn how to do it myself from dclunie pax.tpa.com.au david clunie a bit draconian it have your user unanimously decide that they would like you to do this or have you decide for them from emcguire intellection.com ed mcguire good question nobody have decide i have no definite plan to do this just want the technical data carl kleinpaste karl_kleinpaste godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu ... be i to be in the position of offering such a service again my promise of protection of anonymity would be limited not on the basis of personal opinion of what get post but on the basis of posting which disrupt the smooth operation of the usenet the most obvious and direct recourse would be to out' the abusive individual less drastic possibility exist -- the software support a `` fire extinguisher '' by which individual can be prevent from post john iastate.edu john hascall since when be usenet a democracy if someone want to run an anonymous service their business if you want to put that host in your killfile your business if a newsadmin want to blanket-drop all posting from that site between them and the other people at that site if everyone ignores a service the service effectively exist from jik athena.mit.edu jonathan i. kamens nntp server that allow post from anyone be not `` a service to the net '' they do the net a disservice terminal server have the same problem a open nntp server -- they allow people who want to do illegal/immoral/unethical thing on the internet to do so without accountability there be by now public access site all over this country if not all over the world that allow very inexpensive access to the usenet and the internet there be no reason for nntp server to allow anyone to post message through them and there be no reason for terminal server to allow anyone to connect to them and then make outbound connection through them perhaps when it be harder to get to the internet or the usenet open server could be justified but not now jbotz mtholyoke.edu jurgen botz i think that what ... these point show clearly be that an anonymous post service have a great deal of responsibility both towards it client and towards the net a a whole such a service should imho have a set of well-defined rule and a contract that it client should sign under the term of which they be assure anonymity from an8785 anon.penet.fi be the problem that some be use to `` punish '' poster who be upset in some vague way by complain to the usually acquiescent sysadmin or organization that the poster belongs to that surely be the most gutless approach to solve problem but my experience on the net show that the same user who vilify anonymous posting be the first to write obsessively detailed grievance to the poster 's supervisor when his or her tranquility be disturbed by some `` intrusive '' or subversive post or another anonymous posting prevent just this kind of intimidation from gandalf cyberspace.org eric schilling the main point i would like to make here be that while we can go through and revise the news sw to `` reject anon post to technical newsgroups '' or some such thing i think the attempt will prove futile each attempt to modify news can result in a change approach by anon service provider to thwart the change i think this would be pointless from julf penet.fi johan helsingius i have try to stay out of this discussion and see where the discussion lead but now i rally feel like i have to speak up ... i have repeatedly make clear ... that i *do* block user if they continue their abuse after have be warn in many case the user have take heed of the warn and stop and in some case even apologize in public and when the warn have not have the desire effect i have block a number of user i have also block access to group where the readership have take a vote to ban anonymous posting although i feel change the newsgroup status to moderate be the only permanent solution for newsgroups that want to `` formalize '' discussion red redpoll.neoucom.edu richard e. depew do this ... mean that you be volunteer to issue a request for discussion to ban anonymous posting or to moderate each of the 4000+ newsgroups that your server can reach i think so but this illustrates the trouble that your server be cause please listen to the consensus of the news administrator in this group any newsgroup should be consult *before* let your server post message to that group from c96 vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de alexander eichener there be no pompous `` consensus of *the* news administrator '' here maybe you would like to invent one there be a sizeable number of people who be concerned about the possible and to a minor extent about the actual abuse of the server a it be configure now these concern be respectable johan be deal with them ... there be some few who rage with foam before their mouth and condemn the service altogether and a number who defend it point out like kate gregory that even a group like misc.kids can benefit from pseudonymous posting from julf penet.fi johan helsingius i have answer a lot of personal mail related to server abuse and a a result of that block a number of abusive user i have also withdrawn the service from several newsgroups where the user have take a vote on the issue i have not make any comment on news.admin.policy partly because the newly-implemented password feature a a emergency measure against a security hole have kept me really busy answer user query the last two week and partly because i feel it be not for me to justify the service but for the user the problem with news.admin.policy be that the readership be rather elective represent people whith a strong interest in centralise control from hartman ulogic.uucp richard m. hartman this seem to be a rather bigoted attitude i would consider that this group be for anyone who wish to discus how the net should be control say that we only have an interest in `` centralize control '' be a clear indication of bias you be perfectly welcome to join in the discussion here to promote your view on control jbuck ohm.berkeley.edu this whole debate be a lot of `` sound and fury signify nothing '' because even if you all decide to ban anonymous post server it be not enforceable the only people who conceivably could enforce retrictions be those that control the international link policy change should be make by cooperation not by attempt to dictate ... you need to persuade those who run the service to act like this through friendly persuasion not by try to beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you even have spp zabriskie.berkeley.edu steve pope i be find this bias against pseudonymity boring our friend post through penet have a point the old guard would like to keep their network the way it always have be ... and this new thing these pseudonymous server cut into their turf so they whine and bitch about it and every time there 's the slightest abuse such a somebody 's .sig be too long they try to parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity i 'll go on record a say three cheer for the admins at anon server like penet pax and n7kbt ... and for all the access service provider who be willing to preserve their client privacy and a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity mimir stein.u.washington.edu al billing i help people get rid of anon posting a a group if you like what someone say then you put that anon address in your kill file not all of them of course if and when i get an anon site go just go to assign fake name like `` jsmith '' instead of `` anon5564 '' to avoid most of the hassle never know it be anonymous will you from anne alcor.concordia.ca anne bennett i must admit to some astonishment at this argument i see the value of anonymous posting under some circumstance yet believe strongly that these should be identify a such so that people who do not wish to read material from people who identify themselves have to i fail to see what good you would be accomplish and indeed surmise that you will cause many people inconvenience and annoyance by hiding the anonymity of posting from your anonymous site would you care to justify where the hell you get the gall to try to prevent people from effectively filter their news a they see fit from dclunie pax.tpa.com.au david clunie i thought i be out of reach here in australia too unfortunately one of the u site involve in the us/aus feed complain to the australian academic reasearch network through whom my site be connect not about anything in particular just the concept of anonymous mail have no redeem feature and consume a narrow bandwidth link with which i argue and that be that ... stop the service or face disconnection i consider the demise of my service to have be rather unfortunate and i wish the finnish remailer luck it be a pity that there be very few if any similar service provide with in the u i guess the benefit of have a constitution that guarantee one freedom of speech and a legal and political system that conspires to subvert it in the name of the public good _____ 8.8 what be go on with anon.penet.fi run by j. helsingius from karl_kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu funny how beating the rest of the usenet over the head with a stick be ok if anon.penet.fi and universal anon access but somehow people on the other side of the same equation not even argue to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some control apply to the abuse that manifest themselves allow to do that i have write to johan several time in the last couple of week he use to reply to me quite readily after all i be the source of the software a originally deliver to him -- he use to be downright _prompt_ about reply to me funny now be an impolite bastard who answer mail _at_all_ even when it consists of really very civil query from julf penet.fi johan helsingius in your mail you told me you sent me one or more message on feb. 8th feb 7th and 8th the server be down and the flood of mail that result from the server come up again crashed my own mail host the problem be aggregate by an abusive user send thousand of message to another user fill up that user mailbox the bounce message end up in my mailbox overflow my local disk a well i can only suppose that your message get lose in that hassle a i have try to answer a much a possible of the anon-related message i get from routine mis-addessed message to complaint about the service on the average i spend 4-5 hour per day answer anon-related message from karl_kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu why be it that everybody else have to put up with the impoliteness and insensitivity of the misuse of anon.penet.fi whose definition of `` polite '' and `` sense '' apply and why why be universal anon access consider to be within the realm of this fuzzy concept of `` politeness '' in the first place i think johan have long since cross the line into be a rude bastard and i told him so in private mail a little while ago at this point i deeply regret a have create an anonymous system support 1 newsgroup and b have give the code to johan i copyright it but i thought that some concept of politeness and good sense might follow it to new home interest that johan 's idea of politeness and good sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine i could even cope with universal anon access _if_ johan would be willing to engage in abuse control but somehow that seem to be outside the range of reality ... from julf penet.fi johan helsingius there be no way for me to convey how sad and upset your message make me i do to some extent understand your feeling but it still feel really bad run the server require get use to a lot of flame but mindlessly abusive hate mail be so much easy to deal with than something like this a i do respect and value your view and opinion to a high degree no not ask for sympathy i just want you to know that i be really give your view quite a lot of weight when i ask for the software i be actually only go to provide the service to scandinavian user but a lot of people request that i keep the service open to the international community i now realize that i ought to have contact you at that point to ask how you feel about me use your stuff in such a context again i really want to apologise and i will replace the remain few piece of code thet still stem from your system unfortunately there be no way to remove the idea and structure i get from you again i be really sorry that the result of your work end up be use in a way that you approve of and i will be give a lot of hard thought to the possibility of shut down the server alltogether from karl_kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu i think feel especially rude and impolite if good for johan good for me after all he ask the great usenet whether universal anon access be a good idea he just do it ... yes a seriously rude pain in the as now and i think i 'll arm the usenet death penalty slightly modify not for strategic whole-site attack but tactical assault just `` an 0-9 anon.penet.fi '' destruction only outside alt too let 's say to parrot this line ... people have be do thing like the udp that be cancel others posting for year no one could ever stop them and only politeness and good sense that have prevent them up to now in fact i have 8 people who have express privately the desire and ability to arm the udp ... ps- no in fact there be not 8 newsadmins ready to arm the udp it would be amuse to know how many people gulped hard when they read that though i see it a any different from johan 's configuration pps- now that calm some fear by the above p ... there be 2 newsadmins ready to arm the udp they 've ask for my code i sent it yet only one site would be necessary to bring anon.penet.fi to a screech halt anyone can implement the udp on their own if they care to politeness and good sense prevents them from do so i wonder how long before one form of impoliteness brings on another form from julf penet.fi johan helsingius it would be trivially easy to bring anon.penet.fi to a screech halt in fact it have happen a couple of time already but a we be talk threat here let me make one a well a very simple one if somebody us something like the udp or maliciously brings down anon.penet.fi by some other mean it will stay down but i will let the user know why and name the person who do it ok a somebody say on this thread `` you have to take personal responsibility for your action '' right from avs20 ccc.amdahl.com 134 atul v salgaonkar i be very grateful and appreciative of this service courtesey of penet.fi some important question about my personal life/career/job be resolve due to kind help of other people who have be thru similar situation in return i have also reply to anon posting where i thought i could make a positive contribution in general anon service be a great in my opinion although like any tool some people will not use it responsibly i suggest that it should be kept alive waste bandwidth be less important than save life i think from us273532 mmm.serc.3m.com elisa j. collins i have be inform that the anonymous post service to many newsgroups have be turn off a a result of discussion in this newsgroup over people abuse it i have be post to a nontechnical misc newsgroup about an intimate topic for which i felt i require privacy i have receive immeasurable help from the people in that newsgroup and i have never use anonymity to behave in an abusive immature or unethical fashion toward anyone please folk believe me i *need* this service please consider my point of view and permit admin anon.penet.fi to turn the service back on ... thank you see also

b'deletion how can you reconcile the administration self proclaim purpose of provide law enforcement with access to encrypt data without make the clipper system the only crypto available in the u.s ... the second and fourth amendment do come to mind i think i heard someplace misc.legal comp.org.eff.talk that the court have pretty much eliminate the fourth amendment already'
b"notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal how much of a change be it att 's last product in this area a be price over 1000 a i suspect 'clipper phone will be b come to the customer with the key automatically preregistered with government authority thus aside from attempt to far legitimize and solidify the fed 's posture clipper seem to be `` more of the same '' rather than a new direction yes technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote more widespread use- but at present the man on the street be not go to purchase a 1000 crypto telephone especially when the guy on the other end probably have one anyway be i miss something the real question be what the gov will do in a year or two when air- tight voice privacy on a phone line be a close a your near pc that have get to a problematic scenario for them even if the extent of usage never surpasses the 'underground stature of pgp"
b"then probably also want to start track the customer list of people purchasing soundblaster and similar board which can be configure with the use of some code and a modem to act a a pretty decent digital-encrypting telephone expensive though and kind of awkward i know any drug lord but sure favor something tappable over something secure a long a the user interface be nice when get hrh prince of wale say stupid thing over cordless phone not hard to imagine that drug dealer child pornographer commie lisp programmer and other threat to the civilize world might transact incriminate business over `` encrypt '' cellular phone"
b'so if we subvert one of the two escrow agent we only have a 40-bit space to search through ... 2^40 sound that big be digital telephony subject to a know plaintext attack in which case half the key seem to be all that be need and the two agent escrow arrangement be pointless of course the unknown algorithm might turn gap in speech into pseudo-random sequence or there might be some magic involve or ...'
b"my earlier argument that `` clipper will encourage state and local cop to commit criminal act '' be largely moot now that learn that the fbi will perform the actual tap it will encourage the *fbi* to commit even more criminal act but not the point here but this give another avenue of attack on the clipper proposal when the eff/aclu/cpsr foia request be make they should ask for detail on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that be propose or even already budget for the fbi to service tap request -- for now and the project future from these figure estimate the number of clipper-tap request the fbi be expect publish this figure compare it on a per-capita basis with the amount of tap now know or suspect also estimate how expensive it would be for the fbi to install more clipper-tapping station and how rapidly they could be built and instal ... ie get the `` plus or minus '' epsilon for the near future might be a mite disturb for j. q. public to know these thing and despite all the technical detail btw thanks to those who 've be provide them we still know 1 how the tap request will be transmit and authenticate though it too hard to guess a good scheme 2 how the result will be securely transmit fed ex the audio tape 3 how privacy will be re-established when an investigation be complete"

helsingius identity ======== _____ 1.1 what be identity on the internet generally today people 's identity on the internet be primarily determine by their email address in the sense that this be their most unchanging 'face in the electronic realm this be your login name qualify by the complete address domain information for example `` ld231782 longs.lance.colostate.edu '' people see this address when receive mail or reading usenet post from you and in other situation where program record usage some obsolete form of address such a bitnet still persist in email message additional information on the path that a message take be prepended to the message receive by the recipient this information identifies the chain of host involve in the transmission and be a very accurate trace of it origination this type of identify-and-forward protocol be also use in the usenet protocol to a lesser extent forge these field require corrupt mail software at site involve in the forward and be very uncommon not so uncommon be forge the chain at the origination point so that all initial site in the list be fake at the time the message be create trace these message can be difficult or impossible when the initial fake field be name of real machine and represent real transfer route _____ 1.2 why be identity un important on the internet the concept of identity be closely intertwine with communication privacy and security which in turn be all critical aspect of computer network for example the convenience of communication afford by email would be impossible without convention for identification but there be many potential abuse of identity possible that can have very severe consequence with massive computer network at the forefront of the issue which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problem verify that an identity be correct be call authentication and one classic example of the problem associate with it be h.g.well 's `` war of the world '' radio broadcast that fool segment of the population into think that an alien invasion be in progress hoax of this order be not uncommon on usenet and forge identity make them more insidious people and their reputation can be assault by forgery however the fluidity of identity on the internet be for some one of it most attractive feature identity be just a useful a it be harmful a professor might carefully explain a topic until he find he be talk to an undergraduate a person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him some prejudice be erase but on the other hand many prejudice be useful a scientist might argue he can well evaluate the finding of a paper a a reviewer if he know more about the author likewise he may be more likely to reject it base on unfair or irrelevant criterion on the other side of the connection the author may find identity of reviewer useful in exert pressure for acceptance identity be especially crucial in establish and regulate credit not necessarily financial and ownership and usage many function in society demand reliable and accurate technique for identification heavy reliance will be place on digital authentication a global economy become increasingly electronic many government function and service be base on identification and law enforcement frequently hinge on it hence employee of many government organization push toward strong identification structure but when do identification invade privacy the growth of the internet be provoke social force of massive proportion decision make now on issue of identity will affect many future user especially a the network becomes increasingly global universal widespread and entrench and the positive or adverse affect of these action intend and inadvertent will literally be magnify exponentially _____ 1.3 how do my email address not identify me and my background your email address may contain information that influence people's perception of your background the address may identify you a from a department at a particular university an employee at a company or a government worker it may contain your last name initial or cryptic identification code independent of both in the u some be base on part of social security number others be in the form 'u2338 where the number be incremented in the order that new user be add to the system standard internet address also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood however none of this information be guaranteed to be correct or be there at all the field in the domain qualification of the username be base on rather arbitrary organization such a mostly invisible network cable distribution the only point to make be that early field in the address be more specific such a specific computer name or local network and the later one the most general such a continental domain typically the first field be the name of the computer receive mail glean information from the email address alone be sometimes an inspire art or an inconsistent and futile exercise for more information see the faq on email address and know geographical distribution below however unix utility exist to aid in the quest see the question on this common suffix -- -- -- -- -- -- -- .us united state .uk united kingdom .ca canada .fi finland .au australia .edu university or college .com commercial organization .org 'other e.g nonprofit organization .gov government .mil military site _____ 1.4 how can i find out more about somebody with a give email address one simple way be to send email to that address ask another way be to send mail to the postmaster at that address i.e postmaster address although the postmaster 's job be more to help find user id 's of particular people give their real name and solve mail rout problem the sysadmin i.e root address may also be able to supply information user with related email address may have information however all of these method rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally one of the most basic tool for determine identity over the internet be the unix utility 'finger the basic syntax be finger user here.there.everywhere this utility us communication protocol to query the computer name in the address for information on the user name the response be generate completely by the receive computer and may be in any format possible response be a follow a message unknown host meaning some aspect of the address be incorrect two line with no information and a message 'in real life in which case the receive computer could not find any kind of a match on the username the finger utility may return this response in other situation a listing of information associate with multiple user some computer will search only for match user id others will attempt to find the username you specify a a substring of all actual full name of user kept in a local database at some site 'finger can be use to get a list of all user on the system with a finger address in general this be often consider weak security however because attacker know valid user id 's to crack password more information on the field return by finger be give below more information on finger and locate people 's email address be give in the email faq such a the whois lookup utility just a you can use these mean to find out about others they can use them to find out about you you can finger yourself to find out what be publicly report by your unix system about you be careful when modify finger data virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information in one amaze case the new york time writer j. markoff uncovered the identity of r. morris author of the internet worm through the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger see the book cyberspace by k. hafner and j. markoff _____ 1.5 why be identification un stable on the internet generally identity be an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the internet for a variety of reason one be the inherent fluidity of cyberspace where people emerge and submerge frequently and absence be not readily note in the community most people remember face and voice the primary mean of casual identification in the 'real world the arbitary and cryptic sequence of letter and digit comprise most email address be not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual who may use multiple account on multiple machine anywhere in the world currently internet user do not really have any great assurance that the message in email and usenet be from who they appear to be a person 's mail address be far from an identification of an individual anyone with access to the account e.g they know the password either legitimately or otherwise can send mail with that address in the from line email address for an individual tend to change frequently a they switch job or make move inside their organization a part of current mail protocol standard forge the from line in mail message be a fairly trivial operation for many hacker the status and path information prepended to message by intermediate host be generally unforgeable in general while possible forgery be fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email besides these pathological case abve there be many basic problem with today 's internet protocol affect identification on the internet internet mail standard described in rfc-822 be still evolve rapidly and not entirely orderly for example standard for mail address munging or parse tend to vary slightly between site and frequently mean the difference between find address and bounce mail domain name and computer name be frequently change at site and there be delay in the propagation of this data address can not be resolve when certain critical computer crash such a the receive computer or other computer involve in resolve name into address call nameservers a whole slew of problem be associate with nameservers if they be not update they will not find name address and even the operation of what constitutes update have different interpretation at different site the current internet mail and address protocol be slightly anachronistic in that they be create when the network be somewhat obscure and not widespread with only a fraction of the traffic it now see today a large proportion of internet traffic be email comprise million of message _____ 1.6 what be the future of identification on the internet some new technology and standard be introduce facial image and voice message into mail and these will improve the sense of community that come from the familiarity of identification however they be not currently widespread require large amount of data transfer standardize software and make some compromise in privacy promising new cryptographic technique may make 'digital signatures' and 'digital authentication common see below also the trend in usenet standard be toward great authentication of post information on the other hand advance in ensure anonymity such a remailers be forthcoming see below privacy ======= _____ 2.1 what be privacy on the internet generally while privacy have multiple connotation in society and perhaps even more on the internet in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data store on and and direct to it such a email and you do not encounter arbitrary restriction or search in other word others may obtain data associate with your account but not without your permission these idea be probably both fairly limit and liberal in their scope in what most internet user consider their private domain some user expect or want any privacy some expect and demand it _____ 2.2 why be privacy un important on the internet this be a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic arouse passionate opinion on the internet some take privacy for grant and be rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent most government have rule that protect privacy such a the illegal search and seizure clause of the u.s. constitution adopt by others but have many that be antithetical to it such a law prohibit secret communication or allow wiretapping these rule generally carry over to the internet with few specific rule govern it however the legal repercussion of the global internet be still largely unknown and untested i.e no strong legal precedent and court case the fact that internet traffic frequently pass past international boundary and be not centrally manage significantly complicates and strongly discourages it regulation _____ 2.3 how in secure be internet network theoretically people at any site in the chain of site with access to hardware and network medium that transmits data over the internet could potentially monitor or archive it however the sheer volume and general 'noise inherent to this data make these scenario highly improbable even by government agency with supposedly vast funding and resource technology exist to tap magnetic field give off by electrical wire without detection less obscurely any machine with a network connection be a potential station for traffic detection but this scenario require knowledge and access to very low-level hardware the network card to pursue if even possible a company network general inc. be one of many that manufacture and market sophisticated network monitoring tool that can 'filter and read packet by arbitrary criterion for troubleshoot purpose but the cost of this type of device be prohibitive for casual use know instance of the above type of security breach at a major scale such a at network hub be very rare the great risk tend to emerge locally note that all these approach be almost completely defuse with the use of cryptography _____ 2.4 how in secure be my account by default not very there be a multitude of factor that may reinforce or compromise aspect of your privacy on the internet first your account must be secure from other user the universal system be to use a password but if it be weak i.e easy to guess this security be significantly diminish somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some certain user of the system particularly the administrator generally have unlimited access regardless of password and may grant that access to others this mean that they may read any file in your account without detection furthermore not universally know most unix system keep fairly extensive accounting record of when and where you log in what command you execute and when they be execute in fact login information be usually public most feature of this audit or process accounting information be enable by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aim this information be frequently consult for troubleshoot purpose and may otherwise be ignore this data track unsuccessful login attempt and other 'suspicious activity on the system a traditional part of the unix system that track user command be easily circumvent by the user with the use of symbolic link described in 'man ln unix implementation vary widely particularly in track feature and new sophisticated mechanism be introduce by company regularly typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix functionality with public-domain program and locally-developed tool for monitoring and use them only to isolate suspicious' activity a it arises e.g remote access to the 'passwd file incorrect login attempt remote connection attempt etc. generally you should expect little privacy on your account for various reason potentially every keystroke you type could be intercept by someone else system administrator make extensive backup that be completely invisible to user which may record the state of an account over many week erase file can under many operating system be undeleted most automate service keep log of use for troubleshoot or otherwise for example ftp site usually log the command and record the domain origination of user include anonymous one some software exacerbates these problem see the section on `` x window in security '' indepedent of malevolent administrator be fellow user a much more commonly harmful threat there be multiple way to help ensure that your account will not be access by others and compromise can often be trace to failure in these guideline choose a secure password change it periodically make sure to logout always do not leave a machine unattended for long make sure no one watch you when you type your password avoid password reference in email be conservative in the use of the .rhost file use utility like xlock to protect a station but be considerate be wary of situation where you think you should supply your password there be only several basic situation where unix prompt you for a password when you be log in to a system or change your password situation can arise in which prompt for password be forge by other user especially in case where you be talk to them such a internet relay chat also be aware that forge login screen be one method to illegitimately obtain password thanks to jim mattson mattson cs.ucsd.edu for contribution here _____ 2.5 how in secure be my file and directory the most important privacy consideration be related to file right and many lapse can be trace to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance be aware of the right associate with your file and directory in unix if the x execute right on your parent directory be off for user group and other these user can not gain information on anything in your directory anything less may allow others to read change or even delete file in your home directory the right on a directory supersede the right associate with file in that directory for a directory x mean that access to the file or subdirectory in the directory be possible -- if you know their name to list the content of the directory however require the r right by default most account be accessable only to the owner but the initial configuration varies between site base on administrator preference the default file mode specifies the initial right associate with newly create file and can be set in the shell with umask the detail of right implementation tend

u.s. government grant to develop application to harness the power of network in enhance computational task particularly the human-computer interface the software implement a client-server interface to a computer via graphical window in this case the client be the application request or utilize graphical resource such a window or a mouse and the server be the machine that provide them in many situation the client be an application program run on the same machine a the server the great utility of x window come from it complete dissociation of the client and server so that window may be broadcast to a server at a remote location from the client unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep intricate and complicate security consideration the primary security and privacy issue associate with x window be that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network and over wider region than in the case where the human be situate near the host computer currently there be no encryption of data such a screen update and keystroke in x window due to either intentional design decision or unintentional design flaw early version of the x window system be extremely insecure anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically base on access to the device unix:0.0 by any regular user there be no protection from this type of access in these version the problem arises because the security be completely base on machine address rather than user such that any user at a trust machine be himself trust quote from x documentation man xsecurity any client on a host in the host access control list be allow access to the x server this system can work reasonably well in an environment where everyone trust everyone or when only a single person can log into a give machine ... this system do not work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and mutual trust do not exist with the access control list the xhost command may prevent some naive attempt i.e those other than the direct-access unix:0.0 evasion the syntax a typed on the host machine be `` xhost name '' where name be the domain name or internet address of an authorize client machine by default client run nonlocal to the host be disabled public domain program to disrupt a display momentarily such a 'flip or slowly mirror the screen image or cause pixel to 'melt down to the bottom have be circulate on the internet among hacker for several year and played a prank on unsuspecting or inexperienced user much more serious security breach be conceivable from similar mechanism exploit this inherent weakness the minimal easily-bypassed trusted' security mode of xhost have be jokingly refer to a `` x hang open security terrible. '' new version of the x window system x11r5 and high by default make server access a secure a the file system use a .xauthority file and 'magic cooky remote machine must have a code in the .xauthority file in the home directory that match the code allow by the server many old program and even new vendor-supplied code do not support or be incompatible with magic cooky the basic magic cookie mechanism be vulnerable to monitoring technique described earlier because no encryption of key occurs in transmission x11r5 also include other sophisticated encryption mechanism try man xsecurity to find out what be support at your site even though improve security mechanism have be available in x window since ~1990 local site often update this software infrequently because installation be extremely complex thanks to marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale.cs.indiana.edu jim mattson mattson cs.ucsd.edu and bill marshall marshall cs.iastate.edu for contribution here _____ 2.7 how in secure be my email by default not very the character that you be reading be almost certainly encode in ascii the american standard code for information interchange that map alphabetic and symbolic character onto numeric code and vice versa virtually every computer system us this code and if not have way of convert to and from it when you write a mail message by default it be be sent in ascii and since the standard be virtually universal there be no intrinsic privacy despite milleniums worth of accumulate cryptographic knowledge cryptographic technology be only recently be establish that afford high priority to privacy a a primary criterion in computer and network design some potential pitfall in privacy be a follow the most serious threat be instance of immature or unscrupulous system operator reading private mail in the spool file at a local site i.e at the source or destination of the message such a a university system administrator may also release file to law enforcement agency but convention and protocol for warrant involve computer search have still not be strongly establish and test legally note that bounce message go to postmaster at a give site in their entirety this mean that if you address mail with an incorrect address it have a good chance of be see by a human other than the recipient typically new user account be always set up such that the local mail directory be private but this be not guaranteed and can be overridden finally be aware that some mail list email address of everyone on a list be actually publicly accessable via mail rout software mechanism this feature can be disabled most potential compromise in email privacy can be thoroughly avoid with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography which have it own set of caveat for example unscrupulous administrator may still be a threat if the encryption site be share or nonlocal see the section on `` email privacy '' and `` email policy '' _____ 2.8 how be i not liable for my email and posting a punishment or whatever your system administrator can revoke certain privilege such a email usenet post or reading certain group file transfer remote communication or generally any subset of capability available from your account this all be completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedure follow at a particular site which in many case be haphazard and crisis-oriented currently there be virtually no widespread uniform guideline or procedure for restrict use to any internet service and local administrator be free to make arbitrary decision on access today punitive measure be regularly apply in various situation in the typical scenario complaint s reach a system adminstrator regard abuse by a user usually but not necessarily precede by complaint to the user in email regard that person's objectionable email or posting abusive poster to usenet be usually first give admonition from their system administrator a urge by others on the net the debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this be also use a a questionable mean of attack or silence harmless crackpot or censor unpopular opinion system administrator at remote site regularly cooperate to 'squelch severe case of abuse in general however by tradition usenet reader be remarkably tolerant of diverse view and us of the system but a colorful vocabularly of slang help describe their alternative when this patience be sap the option wield by the individual user be to simply advance to the next message refer to a `` hit the n key '' or to plonk' annoy poster accord to the hacker 's dictionary the sound a jerk make at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file in case where punitive action be apply generally system administrator be least likely to restrict email usenet posting be much more commonly restrict either to individual user or entire group such a a university campus restriction be most commonly associate with the follow abuse harass or threaten note email terrorism' illegal us e.g piracy or propagation of copyright material ad hominem attack i.e insult the reputation of the poster instead of cite the content of the message intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness inappropriate posting esp binary file in regular group mail-bombing inundate mail box with numerous or massive file major problem originate from lack of distinction in private and official email or posting most user have internet access via account at business or university and their activity on the internet can be construe a representative of their parent organization many people put disclaimer in their signature in an attempt dissociate their identity and activity from parent organization a a precaution a recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail write by white house staff member of the bush administration follow be some guideline acquaint yourself with your company or university policy if possible avoid use of your company email address for private communication use a disclaimer keep a low profile avoid flamewars or simply post avoid post information that could be construe to be proprietary or internal the follow reference be available from ftp.eff.com see also the section on `` internet use policy '' /pub/academic/banned.1991 /pub/academic/banned.1992 -- computer material that be banned/challenged in

description of the item in the directory /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability -- note on university liability for usenet _____ 2.9 how do i provide more/less information to others on my identity the public information of your identity and account be mostly available though the unix utility finger described above you have control over most of this information with the utility chfn the specific vary between site on some system use passwd -f you can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which be copy directly to the destination during the finger a technique that work at some site allows you to find out who be 'finger'ing you and even to vary the .plan file sent to them your signature be determine by the environment variable signature usenet signature be conventionally store in the .signature file in your home directory provide less information on your online identity be more difficult and involve one approach be to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you such a your full name you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally you may be able to remotely login via modem or otherwise to computer that you be not physically near these be tactic for hiding or mask your online activity but nothing be foolproof consult man page on the 'chmod command and the default file mode generally file on a share system have good safeguard within the user pool but very little protection be possible from corrupt system administrator to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different account more untraceable be new anonymous post and remailing service that be very recently be establish see below ______ 2.10 who be my sysadmin what do s/he know about me the requirement and screen for get a system administration job and thereby access to all information on a system vary widely between site and be sometimes frighteningly lax especially at university many unix system at university be largely manage by undergraduate with a background in compute and often hack in general commercial and industrial site be more strict on qualification and background and government site be extremely strict the system adminstrator root user can monitor what command you use and at what time s/he may have a record backup of file on your account over a few week s/he can monitor when you send email or post usenet message and potentially read either s/he may have access to record indicate what host you be use both locally and elsewhere administrator sometimes employ specialized program to track strange or unusual activity which can potentially be misuse ______ 2.11 why be privacy un stable on the internet for the numerous reason list above privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet furthermore large part of the internet be fund by the u.s. nsf national science foundation which place certain restriction on it use such a prohibit commercial use some high-level official in this and other government agency may be oppose to emerge technique to guarantee privacy such a encryption and anonymous service historically the major threat to privacy on the internet have be local perhaps the most common example of this be the widespread occurrence of university administrator refuse to carry some portion of usenet newsgroups label a pornographic the alternative hierarchy in the usenet system which have virtually no restriction on propagation and new group creation be frequently target although this material may appear anywhere from the global point of view traffic be generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offender be pursue for example verbatim transcription of copyright material such a newspaper or magazine article be post to usenet with regularity without major consequence some email complaint may ensue more astonish to some be that currently significant portion of usenet traffic and less so internet traffic be comprise of sexually-explicit digitize image almost entirely originate from copyright material newsgroups such a alt.sex regularly have the high traffic ______ 2.12 what be the future of privacy on the internet some argue that the internet currently have an adequate or appropriate level of privacy others will argue that a a prototype for future global network it have woefully inadequate safeguard the internet be grow to become a completely global international superhighway for data and this traffic will inevitably entail data such a voice message postal mail and many other item of extremely personal nature computer item that many people consider completely private such a their local hard drive will literally be inch from global network connection also sensitive industrial and business information be exchange over network currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet most would agree that for these basic but sensitive us of the internet no significant mechanism be currently in place to ensure much privacy new standard be call for uniform introduction of privacy enhance mail pem which us encryption technology to ensure privacy so that privacy protection be automatic and may significantly improve safeguard the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy such a with surreptitious surveilance can be overwhelmingly effective in protect it e.g with encryption some government agency be oppose to unlimited privacy in general and believe that it should lawfully be forfeit in case of criminal conduct e.g court-authorized wiretapping however powerful new technology to protect privacy on computer be become increasingly popular provoke some to say that `` the cat be out of the bag '' and the `` genie be put back in the bottle '' in less idiomatic term they believe that the spread of strong cryptography be already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable to date no feasible system that guarantee both secure communication and government oversight have be propose the two goal be largely incompatible proposal for `` registration '' of secret key by d. denning on sci.crypt for example have be met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at bad mainly because of concern for the right to privacy and objection of inherent feasibility electronic privacy issue and particularly the proper role of network and the internet will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few year anonymity ========= _____ 3.1 what be anonymity on the internet simply state anonymity be the absence of identity the ultimate in privacy however there be several variation on this simple theme a person may wish to be consistently identify by a certain pseudonym or handle and establish a reputation under it in some area provide pseudo-anonymity a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one-way message a sort of hit-and-run or a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others with either know or anonymous identity via an anonymous return address a user may wish to appear a a regular user but actually be untraceable sometimes a user wish to hide who he be send mail to in addition to the message itself the anonymous item itself may be direct at individual or group a user may wish to access some service and hide all sign of the association all of these us be feasible on the internet but be currently tricky to carry out in practice because of all the track mechanism inherent to operating system and network protocol official of the nsf and other government agency may be oppose to any of these us because of the potential for abuse nevertheless the inherent facelessness of large network will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity _____ 3.2 why be anonymity un important on the internet anonymity be another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depend on it use arguably absence of identification be important a the presence of it it may be the case that many strong benefit from electronic anonymity will be discover that be unforeseen and unpredicted because true anonymity have be historically very difficult to establish one can use anonymity to make personal statement to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if state openly such a employer/employee scenario one can use it to pas information and evade any threat of direct retribution for example whistleblower reporting on government abuse economic social or political can bring issue to light without fear of stigma or retaliation sensitive personal potentially damage information be often post to some usenet group a risky situation where anonymity allows conversation to be carry on completely independent of the identity of the participant some police department run phone service that allow anonymous reporting of crime such us would be straightforward on the network unfortunately extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurance of anonymity _____ 3.3 how can anonymity be protect on the internet the chief mean a allude to above be mask identity in email and post however anonymous account public account a accessable and anonymous a e.g public telephone may be effective a well but this use be generally not officially support and even discourage by some system adminstrators and nsf guideline the nonuniformity in the requirement of obtain account at different site and institution make anonymous account generally difficult to obtain to the public at large many communication protocol be inherently detrimental to anonymity virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet new communication protocol will likely develop that guarantee much high degree of secure anonymous communication _____ 3.4 what be anonymous mail one approach to anonymizing mail have be to set up an anonymous server that when activate by email to it address responds by allocate and supply an anonymous id that be unique to the person request it base on his email address this will vary for the same person for different machine address email origination to send anonymous mail the user sends email direct to the server contain the final destination the server anonymizes the message by strip of identification information and forward the message which appear to originate from the anonymous server only from the correspond anonymous user id this be the interactive use of anonymity or pseudonymity mention above another more fringe approach be to run a cypherpunk remailer from a regular user account no root system privilege be require these be currently be pioneer by eric hughes and hal finney hal alumni.caltech.edu the operator run a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristic that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail typically field in the header one have be implement a a perl script run on unix several of these be in existence currently but site and software currently be highly unstable they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge the remailers generally support anonymous return address mail that be incorrectly address be receive by the operator generally the user of the remailer have to disavow any responsibility for the message forward through his system although actually may be held liable regardless these approach have several serious disadvantage and weakness the anonymous server approach require maintain a mapping of anonymous id 's to real address that must be maintain indefinitely one alternative be to allow deallocation of alias at the request of the user but this have not be implement yet although an unlikely scenario traffic to any of these site could conceivably be monitor from the outside necessitate the use of cryptography for basic protection local administrator can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local network or government agency unscrupulous provider of the service can monitor the traffic that go through them most remailers currently keep log that may be inspect the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operator be basically network user who do not own the equipment and be accountable to their own system administrator who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation be discover regard it a illicit use in all case a high degree of trust be place in the anonymous server operator by the user currently the most direct route to anonymity involves use smtp protocol to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hacker and the approach use by remailers be generally view with hostility by most system administrator information in the header rout data and log of network port connection information may be retain that can be use to track the originate site in practice this be generally infeasible and rarely carry out some administrator on the network will contact local administrator to request a message be tracked and it writer admonish or punish more severely such a revoke the account all of this actually happen occasionally but infrequently see the section `` know anonymous mail and post site '' and `` responsibility associate with anonymity '' _____ 3.5 what be anonymous post anonymous server have be establish a well for anonymous usenet post with all the associate caveat above monitor traffic capricious or risky local circumstance log make sure to test the system at least once by e.g anonymous post to misc.test however some operator recommend this because many site autorespond to test message possibly cause the anonymous server to allocate anonymous id for those machine see the `` responsibilties associate with anonymous post '' before proceed another direct route involves use nntp protocol to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hacker be also generally view with hostility by most system administrator and similar consequence can ensue see the section `` know anonymous mail and post site '' and `` responsibility associate with anonymity '' _____ 3.6 why be anonymity un stable on the internet a note many factor compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community and these service should be use with great caution to summarize the technology be in it infancy and current approach be unrefined unreliable and not completely trustworthy no standard have be establish and trouble situation of loss of anonymity and bug in the software be prevalent here be some encounter and potential bug one anonymous remailer reallocate already allocate anonymous return address others pass signature information embed in message unaltered address resolution problem result in anonymized mail bounce to a remailer be common forgery to the anonymous server itself be a problem possibly allow unauthorized user to potentially glean anon id email address mapping in the alias file this can be remedied with the use of password infinite mail loop be possible with chain remailers source code be be distribute test and refine for these system but standard be progress slowly and weakly the field be not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agency the whole idea be essentially still in it infancy and view with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet see a illegitimate or favorable to criminality the major objection to anonymity over regular internet use be the perceive lack of accountability to system operator i.e invulnerability to account restriction result from outside complaint system adminstrators at some site have threaten to filter anonymous news posting generate by the prominent server from their redistribution flow this may only have the effect of encourage server operator to create less characteristically detectable header probably the least problematic approach and the most traditional to usenet be for individual user to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer e.g ignore it or filter it with kill file _____ 3.7 what be the future of anonymity on the internet new anonymous protocol effectively serve to significantly increase safeguard of anonymity for example the same mechanism that route email over multiple host thereby threaten it privacy can also be use to guarantee it in a scheme call chain an anonymous message be pass through multiple anonymous server before reach a destination in this way generally multiple link of the chain have to be broken for security to be compromise re-encryption at each link make this scenario even more unlikely even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weakness such a corrupt government or legal wiretapping within a nation would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message trace however remailers run by corrupt operator be possible the future of anonymous service on the internet be at this time highly uncertain and fraught with peril while specific group seem to benefit significantly from anonymous post capability many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous post be a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussion in serious group the introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussion on usenet convention and distribution mechanism such a moderate and alt group have have in the past for example a part of new group creation the charter may specify whether anonymous post be un welcome nevertheless the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable base on traffic statistic anonymous service be in huge demand pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequence however if it use be continued to be generally regard a subversive it may be confine to the underground the ramification of widespread introduction of anonymity to usenet be still largely unknown it be unclear whether it will provoke signficant amount of new traffic or instead of expansion cause a shift where a great portion of exist traffic be anonymized conceivably the service could play a role in influence future mainstream social acceptance of usenet"

b"i perhaps should have be clearer and more concise in my post but what i get from post at 1 be ... the central point i make be that local/state police agency attempt to play by the rule and get warrant legit escrowed key etc. may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level i disagree that this would assist civil liberty by hobble the cowboy cop it would be a strong incentive a vesselin point out for more police agency to `` go rogue '' and try to get key through more efficient q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a ^^^^^^^^^^ court order to do the wiretap in the first place ^^^^^^^^^^^ the clear implication be that there be `` legal '' authorization other than a court order just how leaky be these and who know what 's in those 7 page that authorize the nsa there may well arise a black market of sort _within_ police agency in which key be trade furthermore the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without be caught they already have a communication infrastructure with secure portion there be a few law that i know of that limit citizen right to access police communication or use the information they get it may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that you have broken some other law throw in private detective who have even few policy/constitutional restriction also consider mercenary who 've `` retire '' from intelligence agency william gibson must be love it great story material think it 'll happen well consider e.g the michigan state police generally a very professional organization which for year kept `` red file '' on thousand of suspect commie know full well it be not consititutional the standard of evidence be just about zero people be in the file because they happen to park near a place where say a us-china people 's friendship rally be happen -- the police go around write down license plate number if you happen to be visit a friend who live near the meeting place well the state police wound up filing you a a subversive they be eventually found out and a court rule against carry on any more such nonsense i believe thay may have have to destroy the tape a well even with well-meaning cop and sure there be many there will be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguard we need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officer -- it will all be in the interest of enforce sensible law save life and protect property compromise will be make by well-meaning officer face what to them will be a moral dilemma clipper will make criminal out of cop do we want to do this to our police force"

b"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\ great ... nice choice of bad guy to convince everyone how `` bad '' unrestricted encryption be why not use a child molester instead of course the word *suspect* be never use here so i guess these people have already be convict and be operating this drug ring from their jail cell how about *this* question instead q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a political opponent of a senior administration official and intercept a conversation ... kinda change your interpretation of the event it and yes the presence of the clipper chip do change thing because it will not only give the people talk on the phone a false sense of security it will also give federal law enforcement agency the justification to deny use of strong encryption method that be inconvenient to them dang it all suppose to be inconvenient but not impossible the only sure way to make sure that abuse be minimize while still allow legitimate law enforcement access uh huh ... sure i predict that within two month week of the chip's debut the full technical detail will be post to sci.crypt and if this have any impact on the security of the key escrow system then be lie to any cryptosystem worth it salt can withstand the light of public scrutiny and there be no way you can be sure that an algorithm have no `` unrecognized vulnerability '' unless you have half the world try to break it for a decade or so even then you get ta be careful"

b"hmm followup on my own post ... well who care first let me try to work out the fact that we get to know about the clipper-chip from what hellman and denning be able to tell u the chip itself be not confine to digital telephony but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner the chip support cfb ofb ecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for de be the algorithm consists of 32 round of *whatever* and take 80-bit key input data seem to be 64 bit yes so if two people want secure communication whatever that mean when clipper be involve they have first to agree on one secret key or be it one key per direction they can exchange this key via dh-schemes or however somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper-chip which be now ready to work the clipper chip carry an unique serial-number 30 b and 160 key-bits these 160 key-bits seem to have be gain by encrypt the serial-number with 160 seed-bits the seed-bits seem not to be store in the chip at begin of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin before send the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put 's out packet i guess 3 which represent the serial number and the session key this might look like x e k chipkeyk1+k2 serial number where x be a transformation of these 3 packet involve a family-key this family sp -key be equal for all chip x might be a simple xor after that the digital phone-call can be do a usual every packet be encrypt and decrypt by clipper denning describes how k1 and k2 shall be generate use a seed of 160 b. now leave alone politics which do not concern me a much a you not be an american citicien tm there be some weak point in this scheme which might be exploit by several party a far a i know about the generation of k1 k2 s1 and s2 look like the obvious backdoor they could be use to generate the chip-keys by know the serial-number and also the family-key of the chip i really imagine why these seed would be need otherwise a true random-sources for the generation of the k1 k2 can be bought for not to much money then the escrow each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-bit key security could a little a existant be maximize by give them 160-bits each which have to be xored together to give the k1 k2 now let 's simply assume the escrow be trustworthy and be fool by criminal or law enforchemnt agency and there will be no quarrel between escrow and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in do their duty and so on and so on once the key be surrender the correspond chip be compromise forever not very clever imho how about send in the encrypt session-keys for each phone-call that the police or whoever want 's to listen to escrow could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police and would naturally not do this after the warrant have expire ... this would be a well technical solution but i guess politics will not work that way apparently a miss dennings state the only one perform actually decodes of intercept message shall be the fbi great so local guy can not inter- cept understand your traffic anymore do this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretap how be law over there i have no idea who be allow to tap and who not this certainly mean that watch communi- cation will be rout automatically from the service-providing company to the fbi if the communicaiton be a watch one and this mean a far a i understand it that the family-key have to be know by each switching- company and those provide cellular-phone servies etcetc so the family-key will not be very secret and thus serial-numbers of call will be readable by anybody who care i _like_ traffic-analysis what do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ecb mode and the first few packet of the chip be somehow lose or garble so the session key would not be actually broadcast over the line hmmm be so difficult to do *that* and now a last point for the other side after all i have read and heard about clipper not the program language for dbase be it it seem to have many advantage which shold not be overseen now an afterthought to your right please note that i have no idea what i be talk about from grady netcom.com 1016/2ef221 if this text be actually in your bill of right who can overrule this but 'freedom of speech be not 'secrecy of speech' maybe you need to extend your amendment 4 to cover information and communication too i be not very sure in what position your government actually be *legally* when it try to ban cryptography and arm amendment say you may have them

secretary the president today announce a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communication while meeting the legitimate need of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunication network and wireless communication link for too long there have be little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes compete interest of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policy have pit government against industry and the right of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology have be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption technology can help american protect business secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the `` clipper chip '' have be developed by government engineer the chip represent a new approach to encryption technology it can be use in new relatively inexpensive encryption device that can be attach to an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of data transmit electronically at the same time this technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal a `` key-escrow '' system will be establish to ensure that the '' clipper chip '' be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american each device contain the chip will have two unique 2 '' key '' number that will be need by authorize government agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two `` key-escrow '' data base that will be establish by the attorney general access to these key will be limited to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer access to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their finding the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology trend and explore new approach like the key-escrow system the president have direct government agency to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizen include the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purpose -- the ability of authorize official to access telephone call and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizen -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure need to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. company to manufacture and export high technology product the president have direct early and frequent consultation with affected industry the congress and group that advocate the privacy right of individual a policy option be developed 3 the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed network `` information superhighway '' will transmit video image hdtv program and huge data file a easily a today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly

clipper chip '' into their device q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be willing to use legal remedy to restrict access to more powerful encryption device a this be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it be just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration be develop the administration be not say `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' a some country have effectively do nor be the u.s. say that `` every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there be a false `` tension '' create in the assessment that this issue be an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concern can be and in fact be harmoniously balance through a reason balance approach such a be propose with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption technique q what do this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect americans' privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware a voice encryption device be subject to export control requirement case-by-case review for each export be require to ensure appropriate use of these device the same be true for other encryption device one of the attraction of this technology be the protection it can give to u.s. company operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export license will be grant on a case-by-case basis for u.s. company seek to use these device to secure their own communication abroad we plan to review the possibility of permit wider exportability of these product"

b"why do it in such a rough manner it be much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin-compatible do-nothing chip that do not encrypt at all chance be that the victim will not notice anything especially if it be do professionally no because the fed will still be able to decrypt the conversation true blame the wrong guy but nevertheless one can not say something like `` the drug arrive tommorrow on the ship 'terminus '' when the fed be listen even if they can not identify who the speaker be no the criminal will just use some secure encryption the new proposal do not stop criminal it ensures that the government will be able to wiretap the average citizen and stop the casual snooper to me it also clearly look a a step towards outlaw any other strong encryption device regard vesselin"

b"archive-name ripem/faq last-update sun 7 mar 93 21:00:00 -0500 about this post -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this be a still rather rough listing of likely question and information about ripem a program for public key mail encryption it this faq not ripem be write and will be maintain by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale.cs.indiana.edu it will be post to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis follow-up discussion specific to ripem be redirect to the group alt.security.ripem this month i have reformatted this post in an attempt to comply with the standard for hypertext faq format to allow easy manipulation of this document over the world wide web let me know what you think disclaimer -- -- -- -- -- nothing in this faq should be consider legal advice or anything other than one person 's opinion if you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer question and answer -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 what be ripem ripem be a program which performs privacy enhance mail pem use the cryptographic technique of rsa and de it allows your electronic mail to have the property of authentication i.e who sent it can be confirm and privacy i.e nobody can read it except the intend recipient ripem be write primarily by mark riordan mrr scss3.cl.msu.edu most of the code be in the public domain except for the rsa routine which be a library call rsaref license from rsa data security inc. 2 how can i get ripem ripem contains the library of cryptographic routine rsaref which be consider munition and thus be export-restricted from distribution to people who be not citizen or permanent resident of the u.s. or canada therefore the follow request be quote from the readme file please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada this be a personal request from me the author of ripem and a condition of your use of ripem note that rsaref be not in the public domain and a license for it be include with the distribution you should read it before use ripem the best way to get it be to ask a friend for a copy since this will reduce the load on those site that do carry it not to mention the human that run them naturally this require that you trust the friend ripem be available via anonymous ftp to citizen and permanent resident in the u.s. from rsa.com cd to rsaref/ and read the readme file for info last i look this site contains only the source tree and do not contain compile binary or the nice mac version ripem a well a some other crypt stuff have it `` home site '' on rpub.cl.msu.edu which be open to non-anonymous ftp for user in the u.s. and canada who be citizen or permanent resident to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub/crypt/ and read the file getting_access for convenience binary for many architecture be available here in addition to the full source tree 3 will ripem run on my machine probably it have already be port to ms-dos and most flavor of unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc port to macintosh include a standard unix-style port and a rather nice mac-like port write by raymond lau author of stuffit more port be expect and help of user be invite 4 will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface be will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the user guide include with the distribution discus way to use ripem with many popular mailer include berkeley mush elm and mh code be also include in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emacs if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe be convenient to use secure and may be useful to others feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem 5 what be rsa rsa be a crypto system which be asymmetric or public-key this mean that there be two different related key one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one can not reasonably be derive from the other you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key need to decrypt it note that the `` message '' sent with rsa be normally just the de key to the real message see `` what be de '' note that the above only provide for privacy for authentication the fingerprint of the message see `` what be a fingerprint like md5 '' be encrypt with the sender 's private key the recipient can use the sender 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender rsa be name for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invent it to find out more about rsa ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt 6 what be de de be the data encryption standard a widely use symmetric or secret-key crypto system unlike rsa de us the same key to encrypt and decrypt message however de be much faster than rsa ripem us both de and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with de use that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient 's public rsa key and include the result in the letter allow the recipient to recover the de key de be sometimes consider weak because it be somewhat old and us a key length consider too short by modern standard however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent small than a large corporation or government agency it be not unlikely that future ripems will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by use multiple encryption with de 7 what be pem and how do ripem relate pem be privacy enhance mail a system for allow easy transfer of encrypt electronic mail it be described in rfcs 1421-1424 these document have be approve and obsolete the old rfcs 1113-1115. ripem be not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificate for authenticate key which ripem do not handle at this time their addition be plan 8 what 's this about distribute and authenticate key for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message receive come from her you must know her public key it be important that this information be accurate if a `` bad guy '' convinces her that his key be in fact yours she will send message which he can read ripem allows for three method of key management a central server the distribute finger server and a flat file all three be described in the ripem user guide which be part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security 9 why do all ripem public key look very similar ripem public key begin with a pkcs identifier describe various characteristic about the key so the first bunch of character in your key may be the same a those of lot of other people 's key this do not mean your key be similar but only that they be the same class of key be generate with the same program be of the same length etc 10 what be a fingerprint like md5 md5 be a message digest algorithm produce by rsa data security inc. it provide a 128-bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it be cryptographically secure because it be not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produce the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender 's private key only the md5 of the message need to be sign for authentication md5 be sometimes use for other purpose for example it be often use to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bit of data a a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md5 be described in it entirety include an implementation in c in rfc 1321 11 what be pgp pgp be another cryptographic mail program call pretty good privacy pgp have be around longer than ripem and work somewhat differently pgp be not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp do also use rsa some major difference between pgp and ripem pgp have more key management feature particularly for user without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus have a great probability of work with other pem software pgp make no attempt to be compatible with anything other than pgp in fact pgp 1.0 be not compatible with pgp 2.0 ripem us rsaref a library of rsa routine from rsa data security inc. rsaref come with a license which allows noncommercial use pgp us it own implementation of rsa which be not license thus pkp the firm hold the u.s. patent on the rsa algorithm claim that it be a infringement of that patent to make use or sell pgp in the u.s. or canada in acknowledgement of this pgp 's original author phil zimmermann say in the documentation in fact if you live in the usa and you be not a federal agency you actually run pgp on your computer because public key partner want to forbid you from run my software pgp be contraband both pgp and ripem be export-restricted and can not be sent outside the u.s. and canada however pgp already exists on many ftp site in europe and other place whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp be recommend reading to anyone interested in such issue note that the above fact both regard patent and export restriction be somewhat controversial many people think it be that way and some people interpret various document differently unfortunately discussion of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in misc.legal.computing see `` disclaimer '' 12 what about rpem rpem stand for rabin privacy enhance mail it be similar to ripem but use a public-key cipher invent by rabin which be not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa it be write by mark riordan the same author a ripem it distribution be halt when contrary to the belief of many include rabin public key partner pkp claimed that their patent be broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rest in the difficulty of factor product of large prime not just rsa this claim be not universally accepted by any mean but be not challenged for pragmatic reason rpem be not really use anymore it be not compatible with ripem or pgp 13 what be mime mime stand for multipurpose internet mail extension and be described in rfc 1341. you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime how pem should interact with mime be not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of have a mime type application/x-ripem in order to send ripem message a mime one i hope some standard will emerge draft internet document exist on the matter 14 i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem ..."

b"here 's a simple way to convert the clipper proposal to an unexceptionable one make it voluntary that be -- you get high quality secure nsa classify technology if you agree to escrow your key otherwise you be on your own the disturb part use of other product be voluntary for now and the press release talk about the white house 's unwillingness to decide that citizen have a right to good commercial crypto gear and about how commercial alternative will be permit a long a they provide key escrow service a clear implication that consider ban alternative additionally use of real alternative be n't totally legal not allow to export really good crypto equipment except to the government 's friend e.g the australian government you can only export even bad crypto equipment with their permission and the regulator who control the cellular telephone company make sure there be only two competitor so joe 's garage cellular start offering a secure service"
b"instead of reading between the line try to think a little bit ok if way too difficult to you here be some hint indeed the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on the local police if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie that your mom be tell you on the phone so guess what they will do propose that the new technology be remove or implement some '' facilitation '' of course you want to wait until they get the approval from two different agency to decrypt the conversation between two child molester because meanwhile those two child molester might be conspire about molest your child right so there should be some way for them to get access to those key -quickly- right like they could have a copy of the database and worry about a warrant later ... regard vesselin"

content what be the national security agency nsa what be the u export regulation what be tempest what be the beale cipher and be they a hoax what be the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch be rsa patent what about the voynich manuscript what be the national security agency nsa the nsa be the official security body of the u.s. government it be give it charter by president truman in the late 40 's and have continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa be know to be the large employer of mathematician in the world and be also the large purchaser of computer hardware in the world government in general have always be prime employer of cryptologist the nsa probably posse cryptographic expertise many year ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the system use in practice but for reason of national security almost all information about the nsa be classify bamford 's book bamfd give a history of the people and operation of the nsa the follow quote from massey mas88 highlight the difference between public and private research in cryptography `` ... if one regard cryptology a the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conduct behind close door without doubt the number of worker engage today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engage in open research in cryptology for only about 10 year have there in fact be widespread open research in cryptology there have be and will continue to be conflict between these two research community open research be common quest for knowledge that depends for it vitality on the open exchange of idea via conference presentation and publication in scholarly journal but can a government agency charge with responsibility of break the cipher of other nation countenance the publication of a cipher that it can not break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government 's code-breakers one might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would force all government to behave like stimson 's gentleman but one must be aware that open research in cryptography be fraught with political and ethical consideration of a severity than in most scientific field the wonder be not that some conflict have occur between government agency and open researcher in cryptology but rather that these conflict at least those of which we be aware have be so few and so mild '' what be the u export regulation in a nutshell there be two government agency which control export of encryption software one be the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorize by the export administration regulation ear another be the office of defense trade control dtc in the state department authorize by the international traffic in arm regulation itar a a rule of thumb bxa which work with cocom have less stringent requirement but dtc which take order from nsa want to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc.legal.computing carry many interest discussion on the law surround cryptographic export what people think about those law and many other complex issue which go beyond the scope of technical group like sci.crypt make sure to consult your lawyer before do anything which will get you thrown in jail if you be lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who have at least heard of the itar what be tempest tempest be a standard for electromagnetic shield for computer equipment it be create in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation e.g. from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort needle to say encryption do

b'while i think it be unrealistic to suppose that the federal agency will fail to promptly comply with a court order there be still a good point here local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bring in federal agency base on the possibly incomplete understand of the system quote from d. denning only the fbi will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer which seem to be need even to identify what escrowed key to request this move a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level the reason i like this point be that it may sway or even persuade people who generally line up with the civil liberty crowd a national police force be oppose by people from a broad range of political viewpoint'

b'imho encryption be also protect under the second amendment of the constitution of the united state i be not surprised that this administration be do this i could have told you so privacy have always be something that have the effect of restrict out ability to prosecute criminal we be suppose to have the presumption of innocence i have the right to pull the curtain over my window and close my door and the police may not come in if i perform a crim in my home they will have to find out by mean other than simply look encryption be to my data a the window curtain be to my home simple enough and yet the people vote for these people because they come out a lie to them about promising to fix thing you mean they might have to go back to actually work to do their job oh heaven perhaps the first amendment definitely the second and fifth unfortunately the vast segment of the population be misinform they just append -sr to the name of out country yet i seriously doubt that the nsa think that privacy and surveillance be compatible i doubt of any smart person in any other agency think so either the problem be that they simply hold privacy to be of no value at all'
b'i think this to be inaccurate one can buy tempest equipment commercially even mac david'
b"ok so there be in fact two distinct component transmit by the chip the real message encrypt with the `` conventional '' key and the serial number and encrypt `` conventional '' key encrypt with the imho kind of bogus a the whole concept of `` one key that million of people use which be change '' seem reasonable `` family key '' suppose i analyze the output of this chip and able to determine which bit be the encrypt packet which contains the serial number and session key suppose i also design a simple algorithm base on this information which take the data contain the encrypt session key and twiddle a bit or several before sent down the line mind you sure the nsa thought of this along with a dozen other attack i imagine and the system be probably somehow design so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receive chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully but how what if the two party agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme so the decryption chip see the restore '' proper '' bitstream but an eavesdropper get a e k uk packet wrong i suppose this could be easily defeat if the chip `` sends '' that information out many time in slightly different way make it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information be sent"
b"the cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversation encryption be not end-to-end but cellphone to base-station it *has* to be this way so that cellular user and fix installation can talk to each other for cellular to cellular call the transmission be decrypt at the base-station pass to another base-station and re-encrypted the cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's equipment the only reason for want a crackable system be so they can listen without have to obtain a warrant but maybe the clipper system be secure and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in use a scanner see above they *have* to go down this route anyway i have my doubt but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want well judge it appear he a drug-dealer after all so naturally stop listen in ... that be true for the uk paul but fairly sure talk about building end-to-end encryption phone out of this chip *not* for cellular though it certainly could be use there in the way you suggest"

b"specifically the terrorist and drug dealer who proponent of key escrow cite a threat will be highly motivate to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed why do it in such a rough manner it be much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin-compatible do-nothing chip that do not encrypt at all chance be that the victim will not notice anything especially if it be do professionally assume that the bad guy can easily obtain substitute chip which cause any noticeable effect to either the user or the person at the other end of the line if there be any significant difficulty to obtain such chip some of the criminal will decide to fall back on the murder/kidnap method once a suitable collection of device be steal criminal can communicate with impunity assume the cipher system carry no trapdoors apart from key escrow until and unless the compromise be discover by some other mean no because the fed will still be able to decrypt the conversation true blame the wrong guy but nevertheless one can not say something like `` the drug arrive tommorrow on the ship 'terminus '' when the fed be listen even if they can not identify who the speaker be this assumes that the fed be tap clipper phone belonging to ordinary citizen get such a phone be the whole point of the crime under discussion to be sure i put it past them -- but raise the possibility of such crime have the benefit of force the fed to either 'fess up about such intention in advance or state that use clipper expose the user to an additional criminal threat g no the criminal will just use some secure encryption the new proposal do not stop criminal it ensures that the government will be able to wiretap the average citizen and stop the casual snooper to me it also clearly look a a step towards outlaw any other strong encryption device"
b"philip i think your idea be well take and constructive thanks for articulate them in this forum a a flame libertarian paranoid extremist i'at a loss for specific objection that sound frighteningly technical any suggestion perhaps somebody could post a list of these one way to do this might be to suggest that these company should be implement their own scheme not be limited to the govt's scheme i find that most of my reason for opposition to the clipper scheme be algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/nsa these be hard to sell in letter to the editor and to nontechnical people any hint or advice maybe a small faq-type thing `` why should i hate clipper '' would be a good idea"

b"this announcement be somewhat disconcert it do anything evil in and of itself but bodes badly for the future of open algorithm and standard in information security i start panic until/unless de or rsa or stuff like that be prohibit but a little anxious no doubt it be long before someone post explain how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived nsa-pkp-irs-fbi-cia-handguncontrolinc-clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom democracy and mathematics my feel be that the administration probably that worried about thing like de and rsa and pgp and ripem since never be use by a group much wider than u computer geek the fact that this just come out now suggests one of two thing 1. the nsa have be work on this for a long time and it only just now happen to be `` ready '' to release to the world at this time 2. the nsa have be work on this for a long time but able to get the bush administration to go along with this plan i find it unlikely that this would have be because of a sympathy for the unescrowed use of cryptography more likely the administration felt that even escrowed secret-algorithm and for all we know trivially breakable cryptography should not be make widely available thus say clipper csrc.ncsl.nist.gov clipper chip announcement the majority of the discussion involve this `` clipper chip '' seem to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversation do anyone know if that mean this chip be design to work primarily with analog signal the language sort of suggests this but hard to say the main thing i just get be whether this chip implement symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic technique anybody know guess symmetric but they get very clear about it if it be symmetric how be it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end how can you negotiate a per-session key use symmetric cryptography without use a trust third party who know your key or do it even use a per-session key if asymmetric what about pkp 's patent which they claim cover all method of do asymmetric cryptography be they get royalty or be hiding infringement the real reason for keep the algorithm secret"

b"an excellent idea while i know the full scope of the activity of the eff from what little see i think it would be well to lobby for strong cryptography through a distinct organization the eff have be associate with effort to prevent the ban of sex and picture newsgroups at various university horror story about the content of those group e.g exploitative picture of possibly underaged model have already surface in the press the white house bulletin already raise the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism which be only one step remove from the old `` crypto-wielding child molester '' argument an eff lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derail by the connection to child pornography and the like similarly lpf be connect with stallman and his gnu project in light of say the gnu manifesto this mean that in a public debate it stand to be label a `` communist '' `` anarchist hacker '' radical etc i know about cpsr but if it be an offshoot of physician for social responsibility best know for helen caldicott and her hysterical antinuclear lobbying then it probably also carry unwelcome political baggage perhaps for practical reason a lobbying organization for cryptography would best be form under the umbrella of eff or some other exist group but it charter should then be distinct independent and limited to advocacy for the right to cryptography to reiterate dan bernstein's question do any suitable organization exist if not what be you go to do about it have mention the possible danger of unwelcome political association i would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction gathering the support of the nra by emphasize the rkba side of the issue a well a the first-amendment side"
b"my thought on why the algorithm be secret the chip be regretably likely to become a standard there will be many application where economic factor dictate use of this chip like it or not if the alrogithm be public and the code be a secure absent the access to escrowed key a represent an enterprising sort would make `` compatible crypto chip for which no key have be escrowed '' this be likely what the release be refer to when they refer to the secrecy of the algorithm protect the security of the escrow system"
b"another objection occur to me there be a comment about how supposedly there would only be one decode box operate by the fbi this be flat ridiculous and i believe it for a millisecond even *if* they in fact only build one or two or some other small number of these that stop others from building one make it work like two clipper-chip phone one listen to each side of the record conversation i 'll have to have another look at the spec post so far but offhand i see anything that would preclude this sort of thing ... .."

b"from denning the skipjack encryption algorithm f an 80-bit family key that be common to all chip n a 30-bit serial number u an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all message encrypt with the chip e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block where the session key be k and be transmit encrypt in the unit key u. which along with the serial number n be encrypt in the family key f. presumably the protocol can be recover if by nothing else differential analysis postulate if you will a chip or logic sit between the clipper chip and it communication channel the function of this spoof chip be twofold 1 transmit channel the spoof chip xors the 30 bit encrypt serial number with a secondary key variable this render the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key 2 receive channel the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypt serial number with a secondary key variable assume integrity of the law enforcement block be necessary for local operation checksum sequence control etc. this have the net result of hiding the serial number it be probable theere be a know plaintext pattern use a a filler in the block contain n 34 bit a use in generate u u1 u2 correctness of the law enforcement block can be determine with only the family key f. whereas no one have propose federal agency be deny f and because they could recover it themselves the correctness of the serial number can be test by examine the pad bit of n in e n f the one could selectively alter the law enforcement block a above but the mutilation could be detect a well approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block if it be do with a group encryption scheme such a de or presumably skipjack the chance the law enforcement block can be recover be lessen what do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognize and the serial number decrypt in a target search when digital transmission becomes widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmission be refuse when contain mutilate law enforcement block one way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block contain m a well a spoof the law enforcement block the goal be to use a secure communication scheme without redress to detection or key k interception contain encrypt within the law enforcement block the data stream be return to it original state for use by the clipper chip or system if require for proper operation it be somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contain within the clipper chip yet likely that sequence of event will be test for require a valid law enforcement block to be receive before accept and decrypt e m k the spoof chip could be implement anywhere in the protocol include on the result serial data stream exist clipper product could be subborned after all they be high security encryption system right super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be use without redress to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial number security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should not be recoverable by other mean one can see the use of cut out for procurring clipper phone or once the number of unit be high enough steal them it would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice from a point of privacy if the serial number n be not associate with a particular clipper chip or lot of chip through the manufacturing and distribution process hopefully the list of know miss or steal clipper serial number n encrypt with f and the protocol be not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypt clipper stream this could be far make difficult by alter the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypt stream detection of an encrypt stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme ****************************************************************************** if you could capture valid law enforcement block not your own and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own where they point to a valid law enforcement block store in a library utilize a session key match the remainder of the transmission you could simply out and out lie yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile force a seemingly valid law enforcement block these capture law enforcement block would be use a authenticator such a in a manually keyed encryption system fend this off would require escalation in examine the protocol and block in the transmission the m code stream might be independently attack base on knowledge of clipper chip protocol a reveal plaintext this could be invalidate by change the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmit stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronize between endpoint the useful life time of capture law enforcement block might be limited base on hostile force use them a target follow transmission interception you would need a large number of them but hey there's suppose to be million of these thing right add time stamp to the encrypt law enforcement block be probably impractical who want an encryption chip with a real time

b"i think pay for it useful i find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement of 5 million quite useful if rough e.g wiretap may be preferentially use on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminal result in an underestimate this come to twenty cent a head over the u.s. population i would find some rigorous number on this quite useful -- it would make for nice slogan `` your privacy be worth 0.37 '' or whatever it turn out to be"
b"a usual david sternlight be demonstrate his inability to read the proposal clearly state the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunication network and wireless communication link it speaks about telecommunication in general read it again david maybe understand it the next time ... nah probably not exactly what the government want all sheep-minded people to think let 's look at the current situation it allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unless secure and i mean secure encryption be use what will happen when `` if '' ha optimist ... the new proposal get accepted almost nobody except some will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of these `` some '' to eavesdrop will be guaranteed the proposal emphasizes on the former `` almost nobody '' which be clearly an improvement and `` forgets '' to mention the drawback of the latter `` guaranteed '' yes my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful you think that it will not happen good luck not just `` continued ability '' -guaranteed- ability yeah exactly what your government want you to think let's take small step one at a time concentrate on the current one think about the future trust u not ask because the proposal clearly say that this be the intention they unlike you read what they write yes it will it will stop the jerk who be eavesdropping now it will allow only to the government to eavesdrop if the scheme be secure of course which be yet to be proven but how do you know that the jerk you be fear now will not get a government job tomorrow the new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then hell that will even motivate him to get that job if he indeed be that mentally pervert ... great the great cryptographer of all time david sternlight tm have succeed to evaluate the new system in the absense of any detail whatsoever and have conclude that it be `` highly secure '' i guess that come from the background of work some 50 year for the two major crypto evaluate company right gee now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto expert to secretly analyse the new secret method for david sternlight have already do all the job for them ... '' trust u from the government and here to help you '' `` those who be prepared to trade their liberty for the promise of future safety do not deserve either '' this or something like that i have the exact quote but the meaning be the same have be say by one of your great men maybe you should study their work more carefully if you have the brain to understand them of course the main question be to guarantee to availability of -really- secure cryptography to the mass gee if the proposal be say `` we guarantee that every american will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal a just a default voluntary implementation '' there would have be much less opposition ... for some reason they even try to promise you that i wonder why ... be orwell off only by 10 year no in return you get crypto that be guaranteed to be cripple while the above be just rumor and while even if it be true it be not do -easily- the new scheme can be guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who have the two key it might be also breakable by somebody who do not have them but know the right trick or who have only one of them nsa also told you that de be secure why you simply trust them huh it be -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable just get the key it might be even easy but until there be some evidence this be just a wild speculation the trapdoors -are- there in government 's hand the key legitimate and who decides what communication be legitimate oh i guess the government right the guy who already have the key kinda if i have the key from your car and i be ask to decide who have the right to use it `` legitimately '' ... impossible since you be demonstrate the same level of incompetence and ignorance a in the provious thread unfortunately i have yet to see you post a technically competent message regard vesselin"
b"this work if there be a checksum on the key you know about neither will register a clipper chip and then substitute a '' counterfeit '' one if the serial number contains a checksum chance be the government have thought of this and `` just anyone '' be permit access to enough of the internals to make a `` fake '' clipper chip chance be that the government have classify some detail of the internals at a very high level and manufacturer be require to observe security safeguard and clearance correspond to that level while not perfect it would prevent joe hacker from roll his own spoof chip since not many counterfeiter can survive a background investigation some of the more notorious self-styled dissident here for example have already get their head so high above the tall grass that have little chance of get a clearance of course not impossible that someone do this but probably extremely difficult chance be there will also be very heavy criminal penalty for phony clipper chip on some national security/classified info ground or other thus make the game not worth the candle"

should read the first part before the rest we have the time to send out miss part by mail so ask note such a `` kah67 '' refer to the reference list in the last part the section of this faq be available via anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu a /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroups sci.crypt sci.answers and news.answers every 21 day content what be cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key what reference can i start with to learn cryptology how do one go about cryptanalysis what be a brute-force search and what be it cryptographic relevance what be some property satisfied by every strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem be theoretically unbreakable then be it guaranteed analysis-proof in practice why be many people still use cryptosystems that be relatively easy to break what be cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key the story begin when julius caesar sent message to his trust acquaintance he trust the messenger so he replace every a by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone who knew the `` shift by 2 '' rule could decipher his message a cryptosystem or cipher system be a method of disguise message so that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography be the art of create and use cryptosystems cryptanalysis be the art of break cryptosystems -- -seeing through the disguise even when not suppose to be able to cryptology be the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis the original message be call a plaintext the disguise message be call a ciphertext encryption mean any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext decryption mean any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem be usually a whole collection of algorithm the algorithm be label the label be call key for instance caesar probably use `` shift by n '' encryption for several different value of n. natural to say that n be the key here the people who be suppose to be able to see through the disguise be call recipient other people be enemy opponent interloper eavesdropper or third party what reference can i start with to learn cryptology for an introduction to technical matter the survey article give in part 10 be the best place to begin a they be in general concise author by competent people and well write however these article be mostly concerned with cryptology a it have developed in the last 50 year or so and be more abstract and mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kah67 be encyclopedic in it history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid-60 's introductory cryptanalysis can be learn from gaines gai44 or sinkov sin66 this be recommend especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithm since it be a common mistake to try to make a system before know how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the de drew the attention of many public researcher to problem in cryptology consequently several textbook and book to serve a text have appear the book of denning den82 give a good introduction to a broad range of security include encryption algorithm database security access control and formal model of security similar comment apply to the book of price davy pri84 and pfleeger pfl89 the book of konheim kon81 and meyer matyas mey82 be quite technical book both konheim and meyer be directly involve in the development of de and both book give a thorough analysis of de konheim 's book be quite mathematical with detailed analysis of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic method especially pertain to key management and the integration of security facility into computer system and network the book of rueppel rue86 and koblitz kob89 concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography how do one go about cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involves an interest combination of analytical reason application of mathematical tool pattern find patience determination and luck the best available textbook on the subject be the military cryptanalytics series frie1 it be clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis be for the most part gain through the attempt solution of give system such experience be consider so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses perform during wwii by the ally be still classify modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factor an integer or take a discrete logarithm these be not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorist be some of the most successful cryptanalyst against public key system what be a brute-force search and what be it cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by try every possible x. brute-force search example say a cryptanalyst have found a plaintext and a correspond ciphertext but know the key he can simply try encrypt the plaintext use each possible key until the ciphertext match -- -or decrypt the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever be faster every well-designed cryptosystem have such a large key space that this brute-force search be impractical advance in technology sometimes change what be consider practical for example de which have be in use for over 10 year now have 2^56 or about 10^17 possible key a computation with this many operation be certainly unlikely for most user in the mid-70 's the situation be very different today give the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel machine threaten the security of de against brute force search some scenario be described by garron and outerbridge gar91 one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibility what be some property satisfied by every strong cryptosystem the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem have a large keyspace a mention above the unicity distance be a measure which give the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercept to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance be much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system be probably strong a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appear random to all standard statistical test see for example cae90 a strong cryptosystem will resist all know previous attack a system which have never be subject to scrutiny be suspect if a system pass all the test mention above be it necessarily strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems look good at first however sometimes it be possible to show that a cryptosystem be strong by mathematical proof `` if joe can break this system then he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factor integer '' see part 6. fail that a crap shoot if a cryptosystem be theoretically unbreakable then be it guaranteed analysis-proof in practice cryptanalytic method include what be know a `` practical cryptanalysis '' the enemy have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figure out the plaintext for instance he might assume `` crib '' -- -stretches of probable plaintext if the crib be correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message or he might exploit `` isologs '' -- -the same plaintext encipher in several cryptosystems or several key thus he might obtain solution even when cryptanalytic theory say he have a chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or be misuse the one-time pad for example loses all security if it be use more than once even chosen-plaintext attack where the enemy somehow feed plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have be employ see kah67 why be many people still use cryptosystems that be relatively easy to break"
b"what they would need to do though be make sure that nobody have access to decent crypto in the first place they probably tell clippered voice from clippered triple-desed voice until they get their copy of your key any criminal who 's go to use encryption will do it under cover of clipper the only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption i probably say this but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmit in the clear some statistical property of the plaintext an old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption which would drastically increase the measure entropy of the input a countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic technique which put out voice you can tell if the nsa built this feature in blow on the mike and observe whether a band of thug come through your ceiling"
b'one presumes the system could work a follow a blank clip be manufacture by mykotronx and vlsi the number produce be carefully audit and they be ship to the first escrow house it program the chip with it half the key and print out a paper slip with the key half and non-secret chip serial number the ream of paper be file in lock box in the vault a fuse be burnt in the chip so that the key be now unreadable the chip then go to the next escrow house where the same thing be do this continue through n escrow house perhaps could be more than 2. the last one provide the chip to the cellular phone maker and yes this have to be a public key system or it would be almost impossible to handle it might not be rsa but that do not mean that pkp get paid until 1997 pkp have the patent on the general concept of public key encryption a well a the particular implementation know a rsa'

b"here be a revise version of my summary which corrects some error and provide some additional information and explanation the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revise april 21 1993 introduction on april 16 the president announce a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communication while meeting the legitimate need of law enforcement at the heart of the plan be a new tamper-proof encryption chip call the `` clipper chip '' together with a split-key approach to escrowing key two escrow agency be use and the key part from both be need to reconstruct a key chip content the clipper chip contains a classify single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm call `` skipjack '' the algorithm us 80 bit key compare with 56 for the de and have 32 round of scramble compare with 16 for the de it support all 4 de mode of operation the algorithm take 32 clock tick and in electronic codebook ecb mode run at 12 mbit per second each chip include the follow component the skipjack encryption algorithm f an 80-bit family key that be common to all chip n a 30-bit serial number this length be subject to change u an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all message encrypt with the chip the chip be programmed by mykotronx inc. which call them the '' myk-78 '' the silicon be supply by vlsi technology inc. they be implement in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about 30 each in quantity of 10,000 or more the price should drop a the technology be shrunk to .8 micron encrypt with the chip to see how the chip be use imagine that it be embed in the at t telephone security device a it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after push a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key k with the device at the other end this key negotiation take place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be use such a the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method once the session key k be establish the clipper chip be use to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitize voice the telephone security device feed k and m into the chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which be transmit over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypt under the unit key u concatenate with the serial number n all encrypt under the family key f. the law enforcement field be decrypt by law enforcement after an authorize wiretap have be instal the ciphertext e m k be decrypt by the receiver 's device use the session key d e m k k m chip program and escrow all clipper chip be programmed inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which be essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chip about 300 chip be programmed during a single session the scif be locate at mykotronx at the begin of a session a trust agent from each of the two key escrow agency enters the vault agent 1 enters a secret random 80-bit value s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret random 80-bit value s2 these random value serve a seed to generate unit key for a sequence of serial number thus the unit key be a function of 160 secret random bit where each agent know only 80. to generate the unit key for a serial number n the 30-bit value n be first pad with a fix 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block n1 s1 and s2 be then use a key to triple-encrypt n1 produce a 64-bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarly n be pad with two other 34-bit block to produce n2 and n3 and two additional 64-bit block r2 and r3 be compute r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 r2 and r3 be then concatenate together give 192 bit the first 80 bit be assign to u1 and the second 80 bit to u2 the rest be discard the unit key u be the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 be the key part that be separately escrowed with the two escrow agency a a sequence of value for u1 u2 and u be generate they be write onto three separate floppy disk the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the correspond key part u1 the second disk be similar but contains the u2 value the third disk contains the unit key u. agent 1 take the first disk and agent 2 take the second disk thus each agent walk away know an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key part however the agent do not know the other 80 bit use to generate the key or the other 80-bit key part the third disk be use to program the chip after the chip be programmed all information be discard from the vault and the agent leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information be left behind the protocol may be change slightly so that four people be in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seed s1 and s2 and the second two the escrow agent would take the disk back to the escrow agency the escrow agency have a yet to be determine but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement have be authorize to tap an encrypt line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communication line let u assume that the tap be in place and that they have determine that the line be encrypt with the clipper chip the law enforcement field be first decrypt with the family key f give e k u n. documentation certify that a tap have be authorize for the party associate with serial number n be then sent e.g. via secure fax to each of the key escrow agent who return e.g. also via secure fax u1 and u2 u1 and u2 be xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u be decrypt to get the session key k. finally the message stream be decrypt all this will be accomplish through a special black box decoder capstone the next generation a successor to the clipper chip call `` capstone '' by the government and `` myk-80 '' by mykotronx have already be developed it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard ds the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a prototoype will be available for test on april 22 and the chip be expect to be ready for delivery in june or july"
b'i somehow start to doubt technical competence of the people who design the system why on the earth split the 80-bit key in 40-bit part to keep them in escrow separately have 40 bit and large volume of data voice link produce it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply could keep 80-bit sequence in n n =2 independent place and then xor all the partial key to get the actual key n-1 sequence should obviously be select randomly and nth be the actual key xor-ed with the random sequence or be it a conspiracy 1/2'

b"... maybe 300 such pair suffice to reconstruct s1 and s2 by such a back- door in the encryption algorithm perhaps it would be possible for the manufacturer to get the key of all chip that be programmed in one session this would not btw enable anybody else to retrieve the key in the same way because never get a bunch of 300 n u pair with identical s1 and s2 note that these have to be constant for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure i.e. they have to be typed in manually by the random number supply agent and i be wonder why always do 300 chip in one session ... since the procedure described by m denning imposes high cost on the production of every chip at least three person for one hour each plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to piece in a spectacular hollywood-like bonfire add travel expense drink and light divide the sum by 300 there be a large demand -- not from the private sector anyway and let me mention one other thought that certainly have occur to all the notoriously paranoid people in this group before who be go to verify that _no_ interested party will perform tempest attack on the vault where there 's so much smoke and mirror -- there be a nice honest fire but something really worth hiding ..."

b'it seem likely to me that that a large subset of encrypt communication would be archive to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant be obtain i can even imagine this be found legal and constitutional since nothing be actually listen to until a valid warrant be issue and the key be obtain imagine archive all pay-phone conversation so if someone turn out to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deal and archive call to/from suspect mafia member potential terrorist radical etc imagine the convenience for the police of be able to get a warrant now and listen to all the call the world trade center bomber make in the past year since archive would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why it happen'
b'i think have to do some massive data compression just to fit a bit of key information on each primary particle of the know universe but hey fun to imagine'
b"i hate to follow up to my own post but i should perhaps clarify some thing so i get flame first of all when talk about `` factor the modulus '' or a `` breakthrough in factor '' what i really mean be a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of rsa i know that factor and break rsa be not proven to be equivalent just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time i also have to admit that i really know if the `` non-group '' property of a cipher be essential only for key chain i have thought about it a little while but i find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure that of course mean nothing at all then i write what i meant be that a long a the only advantage of the cryptanalyst be a faster computer then we will probably have rsa for a long time to come because even if 1024-bit modulus somehow could be broken with fast computer not with a new algorithm then people would simply use longer modulus both user and cryptanalyst benefit from well technology in the same way hope this keep the flame away ... have fun"
b'i hope my cynicism be misplace here go ahead ... not afraid to be wrong every once in a while but i have an uneasy feel that i be right it be and you be wrong yet you emotionally state a bunch of crap a fact with a tiny disclaimer at the end check your fact first and grow up why be there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography and immaturity i wonder oh i see flame someone tell them that they be immature tell them they be wrong and then offer any proof for your assertion you really *are* a putz put up or shut up i will provide any proof you wish in private name it dickhead'

b'follow precedent in other area the government be likely to put a tax on encryption technology once the tax be impose it becomes a federal matter and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the batf or fbi toss grenade into your house the batf appear to be the logical agency to enforce such regulation federal control over alocohol tobacco and firearm be similary base on tax look at the fcc they allow sale of any receiever that can receive band that be suppose to be private this have nothing to do with any desire to prevent harmful interference if the government can make a radio receiver illegal what make you think they claim the right to control encryption'

b"sigh ... my version of 'rn ask me whether i really want to send this post you may a well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the clipper announcement be because of a silly mistake i be the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov alias first.org a system set up to help out the need of first a forum of incident response and security team which include a number of world-wide incident response team such a cert/cc and other place in europe a to the vrfy and expn command they be normally disabled since early on we want cracker to find out the name of incident response folk on our mail list we have a disk crash several month ago which require completely rebuild the o/s file same old story our backup especially helpful a you can guess i remember to re-disable vrfy and expn until i saw people on the net try to find out who be behind clipper csrc ... when i saw people 's name post here i felt it be time to clear thing up so expn and vrfy on csrc have always be disabled in the past for reason have nothing to do with clipper i post the white house announcement at the request of policy folk here because csrc also provide usenet service i post them from an account call 'clipper i also create an alias call 'clipper that contains the address of member of the nist computer security privacy and advisory board set up under law of the computer security act of 1987 and address of other individual not affiliate with nist but involve in cryptography security and privacy i believe that these individual be include on this list because nist felt it important to get them the clipper information first-hand the 'clipper alias be there for the benefit of those name above it be not a source for information it be set up solely to monitor any initial traffic individual on the list have request that they continue to get traffic that be not already duplicate on usenet while you can rightfully say we be a bit disorganize in handle this i would ask that people stop speculate about any hidden agenda or motif of the individual on the 'clipper alias already apologize to them for what 's happen disable expn and vrfy be an increasingly common practice albeit unfriendly to some and any effect of disable it again be unintentional"

b"it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow house release your code to the cop your code be now no longer secure a very good point in the hand of cop and while i be sure most of the time they be good their security will not be a good a the escrow house why should we expect the cop to be honest underpaid for the risk they face every day the medium dump on the all the time and blame them for all sort of discrimination brutality ... how can we expect them to be more than human besides there be lot of case of police abuse range from protection scam to outright robbery when i work in d.c. there be a breakin at a local radio shack and the alarm company heard the cop respond to the call over the audio pickup in the store what this effectively mean be that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligate to inform you that a tap be perform and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it be once again a code know only to the escrow house then you would know that big brother have be listen do he really want to let you know do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charge be laid in many way it would be a positive step if they have to judge set time limit on warrant i assume at the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip if we go with this scheme which i be not sure i agree with completely against anything that make it easy for the government to encroach on the right of individual the founder of this country spent a lot of effort limit the power of the government and specify exactly what the government right be and this include a gov't spy in every bedroom imho there be entirely too many thing go on today design to preserve the government organism at the expense of individual look around and reread 1984 and many early heinlein book there many parallel between the thought police can you spell waco texas and heinlein 's `` crazy year '' bill"
b"i know that at least one person on that list say the first he heard of clipper be in the friday morning newspaper and another have already fire off a letter of protest to nist my point i suspect this list interest a it be for various reason do not represent the cabal that put this proposal together some of them yes others no i receive mail from mitch kapor say that he do not ask to be on the list and do not know why he be add sure the same applies to others on the list so i guess my initial theory be right that the clipper list be just someone 's idea of a bad joke i guess i should be happy it a conspiracy marc"
b'whew take it easy on the guy maybe go to do this in his spare time maybe go to do this to see how much a wiretap *really* cost maybe go to do this so he can add to the opposition to clipper i know fully why he might do this but maybe we start flame at the drop of a hat'
b"prof. denning 's description of skipjack mostly omit chip structure the clipper chip contains a classify 64-bit block encryption algorithm call `` skipjack '' the algorithm us 80 bit key compare with 56 for the de and have 32 round of scramble compare with 16 for the de it support all 4 de mode of operation throughput be 16 mbit a second ... f an 80-bit family key that be common to all chip n a 30-bit serial number u an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all message encrypt with the chip the key k and message stream m i.e. digitize voice be then fed into the clipper chip to produce two value e m k the encrypt message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block three question 1 it look like each 64 bit of input give you 4*64 bit of output e m k 64 bit e k u e 80 bit 128 bit e e k u n f e 128 30 bit 192 bit do you really need to transmit all 256 bit each time or do you only transmit the 192 bit of wiretap block at the begin all 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited application like cellular phone or even regular phone over 2 how do the 4 de mode interact with the two-part output do the various feedback mode only apply to the message block or also to the wiretap block or if the wiretap block be only transmit at the begin do it get incorporate into everything through feedback mode but not during ecb mode 3 do the clipper chip check the wiretap block itself do the block have to be present at all since the receive chip know the transmitter 's u it presumably check the validity of e k u so limited to check the *form* of the wiretap block and maybe check the serial number for reasonableness unless there 's some sort of back-door structure that let it recognize a valid e k u in that case can you replace the wiretap block with a different wiretap block presumably an old valid one to avoid attract attention the chip do it so you postprocess the output regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key paranoid people can use someone else 's serial number on the other hand if i could think of that solution so easily presumably the nsa could too have they do something to block it like use message encryption really e m k u n thanks"

b"thanks for post this and make it available this post will be long i will comment on most of it and be reluctantly leave all of the original in place to provide context please note that an alt group have be set up for the clipper stuff ^^^^^^^^^ hum at t vlsi and mykotronx be 'industry wonder what happen to ibm this should be right up their street and a mandateed scheme be voluntary mr orwell would love this ^^^^^^^^^ telephone encryption and scramble be year behind digital one like rsa idea or even de the above while literaly true be a clasic straw-man claim in the context of non-real-time circuit such a e-mail and the like i would modestly propose that a mandate use of isdn would do more for commun- ications than this lot normmaly de ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ note the use of the word `` business '' in the above the whole tenor of this release seem to be establish a ground rule that only `` business '' use be legitimate for debate if you want the nothing you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private that be not even on the agenda for debate note that there be no role for you to contain private info in this the only reference be to information already in the hand of others the 'unauthorized release bit be also draw a long bow most of these case be by people who have legitimate access abuse it and reveal or often sell the info these people be of course in this proposal the people who will have the key the criminal also use lawers court the cia white-house official and pen to go about their business when will they be outlaw a well yeah several of them would be a well idea than clipper them again the protection of law and the court have be seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ nsa yeah this bit be very true note the repeat mix of telephone scrabeling and encryption a demo of the above claim on an ordanary pot would be a good night entertainment i suspect note also the 'many not 'all a the general tone implies ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the case record seem to indicate that what be need be a brutal tighten of the current abuse i have not heard yet of a case that be impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black the other side abuse by law enforcer be well document even by govt agency and the phone v other coms be blur yet again let run that line twice not **very** carefully what it say the state purpose of the key eschrow be to make the use of clipper compulsory note the word `` ensure '' a to 'protect or 'law-abiding i will leave to you so to the person who ask if it include the outlaw of other encryption the answer in this press release be yes just a they only can wiretap now with a warrent just make sure that the illegal one be preserve where do you find many expert any ex kgb people look for a contract and a a later post asks what of the stu-iiis they already have it will be very interest to see if the military and u embasies start to use it after all it be secure it the govt will answer that point by it own action ^^^^^^^^ again personal use seem to be a unaskable question ^^^^^ ah so warrents be not always need it seem the itars seem to slightly impeed this note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion hence only the desire result will emerge encryption and code have be around for millenia they be generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time the systematic study of cypher have result in a swing in favor of the encrypter at the moment i have no doubt that the factor problem will fall in time probably fofr practical purpose by the middle of the next century it be a little hard to critisise a non-proposal note we drop back to 'phone-mode again if this be a true answer it can be rephrase a `` it suck big time anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast '' this link between the security of the key-eschrow and the actual algorithm be a real winner give that i have 2 secret 40 bit number could someone please explain how the detail of an encryption algorithm will reveal them just make sure you read the cv real carfully ok. quick with out look back what name be miss from that list the people who agree with u and who think there be a buck in it for them the reverse engineering provision of the 'mask-work act could be relevent here you not unless you be one of the 'right people they miss the word secret here he need a grammar lesson too i would say `` less secure less conveniant more expensive pgp be free less available and more prone to be comprimised '' proof to the contarary will be welcome note proof they seem to be say anything that make much sense and this proposal do prohibit it except in a very limited way and this be the one explicit reference to personal right it be a denial and yes i think that the mexican brazilian and canuck be include in clinton et al magnanamous gesture the 'false

b"i have a question that be a slight variation on the previously mention example that perhaps people could give me some pointer on it have be a couple of year since my con law class in college so i hope i be not miss something obvious here ... basic scenario i set up a bb that us public-key encryption and encryption of file on disk the general setup be design so that when user connect they send a private key encrypt use the system public key and the user 's public-private keypair be use to wrap the one-time session key use for encrypt the file on disk the result of this be that even if i reveal the system private key it be impossible for anyone to gain access to the file store on the machine what be possible be for someone to use the reveal system private key to entice user into reveal thier personal private key during the authentication sequence question do the fact that the system private key do not provide any information useful for a search give me any protection a far a be coerce to reveal the key i doubt it myself.. it seem provide the system private key do not mean that i be assist in `` entrapment '' the user would send thier key anyway and be not be entice into do something they would not otherwise do but be there any other hook that can be use would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval any answer or general musing on the subject would be appreciate ... jim"
b'from andersom spot.colorado.edu marc anderson also.. how about a box that you plug your phone into which would allow encrypt voice communication with someone who have a similar box digitize input speech transmit and decrypt on the other end i know how a public-key system could work in this regard but it might ... heh heh ... i post this just before reading all the clinton chip messages.. i guess they beat me to it.. anyway i think it would be a great idea to develop such a product perhaps in the underground a it would otherwise probably become illegal pretty quickly here ... really very feasible and be too expensive all need be a box with a phone jack on one side a dsp in the middle to do codec function of speech- compress bytestream and an rs232 on the other side plug your phone into it plug the rs232 into your computer and have a good old fashion normal modem on your other rs232 port the cpu in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modify to work on a byte stream with v32bis or well modem to carry the bytestream it should work quality would only be marginally low than a normal telephone at the very high price you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modem to do the digitisation that put an upper bound of about 500 on the cost of such a box in practice you really ought to be able to get the price well below 100 i could do it now in software on my cheap nasty home risc box acorn archimedes with the digitise microphone i bought for 25 pound if i knew how to write good speech compression software which i the reason it work of course be that hardly anyone will have one the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip economics afraid however ... we can get about 2kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem when we get isdn for all ha ha ha and the new nren it might then be trivial to run compress speech over a tcp/ip connection on the internet perhaps we should start think now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone call in future 1/2 joking'

b"a nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption device with built-in trapdoors just like the fed want ... bla-bla indeed and the current proposal do nothing to prevent the latter this say much there be many incredibly weak encryption algorithm in commercial use today ... except from the government nope the criminal be stupid enough to use the new chip use something secure this technology provide only mean to intercept the phone conversation of people who be stupid enough to use it that be the government have the key it matter much if they be in one or in two of it hand ... correct it do however provide those american with the false sense of privacy if the screen be not public it can not be trust some people do not trust de even today after all the examination only because some part of it design be kept secret so use a different technology to hide their illegal activity so will those law-abiding citizen who do not trust their government not to misuse it ability to decrypt their conversation except from the government huh later it say that the new technology will be export restrict in short the new technology can 1 protect the law abide citizen 's privacy from the casual snooper it can not 1 protect him from the government if it decides to misuse it ability to decrypt the conversation 2 protect him from the criminal who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the key or to bribe the people who handle them etc 3 prevent the criminal from use secure encryption for communication correct however it do not provide them that much privacy a it claim two candidate the nsa and the mafia that be `` trust u '' `` security through obscurity '' if not entirely open to public examination it can not be trust besides who can prove that the device use for examination and the one built into your phone will be the same the nsa and the fbi why do they `` forget '' the academia this smell to monopolism like the mafia this be the main question why be it bury at the end '' see '' `` trust u '' in short `` if we decide to outlaw strong crypto tell you '' since the u government seem to consider strong crypto a munition and since the u constitution guarantee the right to every american to bear arm why be not every american entitle a a matter of right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product bullshit the propose technology provide a false sense of security encryption device with built-in capability for break the encryption do not prevent the criminal to use strong crypto and be a step to outlaw strong crypto who be the optimist who believe that the new administration will leave the export control on strong crypto device ok not american not my business but i just resist to comment ... the whole plot look so totalitaristic ... up to you american to fight for your right regard vesselin p.s now be the time for david sternlight to pop up and claim that the new system be great"

b"try reading between the line david there be *strong* hint in there that angle for nren next where i honestly see any ... hint 1 sophisticated encryption technology have be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ hint 2 this new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of data transmit ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ electronically at the same time this technology preserve the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ -- the privacy of our citizen include the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purpose ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ -- the ability of authorize official to access telephone call and data under proper court or other legal ^^^^^^^^ order when necessary to protect our citizen very big hint 3 the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed network `` information superhighway '' will transmit video image hdtv program and huge data file a easily a today 's telephone system transmits voice very big hint 4 see above since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use. and the only conceivable meaning of apply this particular technology to a computer network be that they intend it to be use in exclusion to any other mean of encryption. i disagree if for no other reason than that there be already other standard in place besides even if they restrict encryption on the nren who care most of the internet be commercial anyway the nren be only for geovernment and university research read the proposal -- a `` data superhighway '' for cray user not anything have to do with the internet oh i see your point i think wrong but if you sit back and wait to find out if right it 'll be too late just listen *very* carefully for the first 'such and such will not be permit on network xyz shoe to drop"
b"once the chip be release in phone or whatever they be vulnerable to phsyical inspection and observation now i will grant that there will no doubt be safeguard against `` peel '' the chip but the nsa have no monopoly on cleverness the chip and the algorithm it us will not remain secret for very long any university with a vlsi lab have the require equipment a do any offshore semiconductor manufacturer"
b"thank you very much after reading the text some distinct question arise to me which i guess will also be ask by other people perhaps would it be interest to find an answer to these question shorter or longer first question when will the lawenforcmentfield be transmit and how do the remote clipper chip handle it be it transmit periodically in the stream of encrypt block or just at the begin do the phone at the other side discard those packet via a protocol whatsoever or try it to turn them into voice-output which would not be disturb second question why why be such a strange procedure use and not a real rng this turn those s1 s2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security so no technical provision will be take to place a 'timeout on these warrant this would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction by let the escrow-agencies perform the decode of the session key just take modem-lines instead of secure fax be this such a bad idea wow how do the randomizer work be the sha and key exchange secret or publicly know key-exchange be dh i guess it seem that those who be oppose to this chip shall have a tough time your government realy mean to act friendly greeting germano caronni"
b"after reading the debate over the clipper i have a few thing to add first most of the people i know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issue that surround this debate and any question about what be or be not ok to use in the u all they care about be wether or not what they be use be secure or not that after all be the bottom line second if i look at all the people i know who use any form of encryption at all and this group span people from the moron who still insist that the de be a good and secure standard to people look at try to improve upon exist strategy i can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaf their method open to abuse the clipper do this because people make mistake by nature and the u government be make up of people who be just a vulnerable to mistake a everyone else third since most of the people i know be at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerability present in current software encryption stratigies i see how most of them be go to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the clipper chip that despite any strength or weakness that may exist in it so i can not see a high degree of confidence develop in the chip fourth when it come to criminal abuse sure there be many stupid people out there and yes some will be open to be caught via the built in back door of the clipper chip however anyone who be go to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data be go to run into that problem pretty damn fast and i would assume start look around for other easily obtainible method of encryption if nothing else be avalible none of this would be an issue however the truth be that most private encryption user that ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of rsa or pgp or anything else if it work they use it this be not go to change either i do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slow down by the advent of the clipper chip it be all to easy to convert encrypt data into unintellgible garbage a it be if anything the clipper chip just add another tool to the user the bottom line here be that people will use what work and unavoidibly sure most criminal would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charge in the case of criminal who murder a part of their conspiricy the other thing that have struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption have begin be that quite simply the cat be out of the bag or if you have an interest in snoop pandora 's box have be open and this be not go to change see a blindness to this that found utterly stun and the clipper chip along with the way it have be present only confirms this to me to a large degree sincerly tim scanlon --"
b'i hope there be some silicon jock on the committee who can follow the algorithm through to hardware while i doubt the nsa would pull any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- an obvious opportunity to introduce additional hole'
b"be you sure you be watch let me remind you that watergate be only the tip of the iceberg nixon extensively use the nsa to watch people because he like them accord to _decrypting the puzzle palace_ presumably the nsa be restrict from conduct american surveillance by both the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 fisa and a series of presidential directive begin with one issue by president ford follow richard nixon 's bold misuse of the nsa in which he explicitly direct the nsa to conduct widespread domestic surveillance of political dissident and drug user"
b'agree remember i even think of clipper a encryption in any real sense -- if i do probably be a lot more annoyed about it not for clinton or anyone under him to say though only the federal and supreme court can say anything about the constitutionality anything the administration or any governmental agency say be opinion at best'
b"archive-name cryptography-faq/part04 last-modified 1993/4/15 faq for sci.crypt part 4 mathematical cryptology this be the fourth of ten part of the sci.crypt faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we have the time to send out miss part by mail so ask note such a `` kah67 '' refer to the reference list in the last part the section of this faq be available via anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu a /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroups sci.crypt sci.answers and news.answers every 21 day content in mathematical term what be a private-key cryptosystem what be an attack what 's the advantage of formulate all this mathematically why be the one-time pad secure what 's a ciphertext-only attack what 's a known-plaintext attack what 's a chosen-plaintext attack in mathematical term what can you say about brute-force attack what 's a key-guessing attack what 's entropy in mathematical term what be a private-key cryptosystem a private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system e and a decryption system d. the encryption system e be a collection of function e_k indexed by `` key '' k mapping some set of `` plaintexts '' p to some set of `` ciphertexts '' c. similarly the decryption system d be a collection of function d_k such that d_k e_k p p for every plaintext p. that be succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext be accomplish use the same key index a be use for the correspond encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such system wherein the same key value be use to encrypt and decrypt be also know a `` symmetric '' cryptoystems what be an attack in intuitive term a passive attack on a cryptosystem be any method of start with some information about plaintexts and their correspond ciphertexts under some unknown key and figure out more information about the plaintexts possible to state mathematically what this mean here we go fix function f g and h of n variable fix an encryption system e and fix a distribution of plaintexts and key an attack on e use g assume f give h with probability p be an algorithm a with a pair f g of input and one output h such that there be probability p of compute h h p_1 ... p_n if we have f f p_1 ... p_n and g g e_k p_1 ... e_k p_n note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector k p_1 ... p_n the attack be trivial or `` pointless '' if there be probability at least p of compute h h p_1 ... p_n if f f p_1 ... p_n and g g c_1 ... c_n here c_1 ... c_n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to p_1 ... p_n in other word an attack be trivial if it actually use the encryption e_k p_1 ... e_k p_n an attack be call `` one-ciphertext '' if n 1 `` two-ciphertext '' if n 2 and so on what 's the advantage of formulate all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem be secure read part 3 we keep say `` a strong cryptosystem must have this property but have this property be no guarantee that a cryptosystem be strong '' in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology be to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem be strong we say for example that a cryptosystem be secure against all passive attack if any nontrivial attack against the system a define above be too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem easy to break other part of cryptology be also amenable to mathematical definition again the point be to explicitly identify what assumption make and prove that they produce the desire result we can figure out what it mean for a particular cryptosystem to be use properly it just mean that the assumption be valid the same methodology be useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumption often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails and use these failure a the start point for his analysis why be the one-time pad secure by definition the one-time pad be a cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and key be all string say byte string of some length m and e_k p be just the sum let 's say the exclusive or of k and p. it be easy to prove mathematically that there be _no_ nontrivial single-ciphertext attack on the one-time pad assume a uniform distribution of key note that we have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts here 's the proof let a be an attack i.e. an algorithm take two input f g and produce one output h with some probability p that h h p whenever f f p and g g e_k p i.e. g g k p then because the distribution of k be uniform and independent of p the distribution of k p must also be uniform and independent of p. but also the distribution of c be uniform and independent of p. hence there be probability exactly p that h h p whenever f f p and g g c over all p and c. thus a fortiori a be trivial on the other hand the one-time pad be _not_ secure if a key k be use for more than one plaintext i.e. there be nontrivial multiple-ciphertext attack so to be properly use a key k must be thrown away after one encryption the key be also call a `` pad '' this explains the name `` one-time pad '' what 's a ciphertext-only attack in the notation above a ciphertext-only attack be one where f be constant give only some information g e_k p_1 ... e_k p_n about n ciphertexts the attack have to have some chance of produce some information h p_1 ... p_n about the plaintexts the attack be trivial if it have just a good a chance of produce h p_1 ... p_n when give g c_1 ... c_n for random c_1 ... c_n for example say g c c and say h p be the first bit of p. we can easily write down an attack -- -the `` guess attack '' which simply guess that h p be 1. this attack be trivial because it use the ciphertext it have a fifty-fifty chance of guess correctly no matter what on the other hand there be an attack on rsa which produce one bit of information about p with 100 success use c. if it be fed a random c then the success rate drop to 50 so this be a nontrivial attack what 's a known-plaintext attack the classic known-plaintext attack have f p_1 p_2 p_1 g c_1 c_2 c_1 c_2 and h p_1 p_2 depend only on p_2 in other word give two ciphertexts c_1 and c_2 and one decryption p_1 the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption p_2 note that known-plaintext attack be often define in the literature a produce information about the key but this be pointless the cryptanalyst generally care about the key only insofar a it let him decrypt far message what 's a chosen-plaintext attack a chosen-plaintext attack be the first of an increasingly impractical series of _active_ attack on a cryptosystem attack where the cryptanalyst feed data to the encryptor these attack fit into our model of passive attack explain above anyway a chosen-plaintext attack let the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the correspond ciphertext then repeat until he have figure out how to decrypt any message more absurd example of this sort of attack be the `` chosen-key attack '' and `` chosen-system attack '' a much more important form of active attack be a message corruption attack where the attacker try to change the ciphertext in such a way a to make a useful change in the plaintext there be many easy way to throw kink into all of these attack for instance automatically encrypt any plaintext p a t e_k h t+r+p r p where t be a time-key sequence number chosen anew for each message r be a random number and h be a one-way hash function here comma mean concatenation and plus mean exclusive-or in mathematical term what can you say about brute-force attack consider the follow known-plaintext attack we be give some plaintexts p_1 ... p_ n-1 and ciphertexts c_1 ... c_ n-1 also give a ciphertext c_n we run through every key k. when we find k such that e_k p_i c_i for every i n we print d_k c_n if n be big enough that only one key work this attack will succeed on valid input all the time while it will produce correct result only once in a blue moon for random input thus this be a nontrivial attack it only problem be that it be very slow if there be many possible key what 's a key-guessing attack what 's entropy say somebody be use the one-time pad -- -but choose key randomly and uniformly from all m-bit message a he be suppose to for our security proof in fact say know to prefer key which be english word then a cryptanalyst can run through all english word a possible key this attack will often succeed and much faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace"
b"get no doubt that this would probably have go ahead if bush be still president what 's puzzle to me be the people who be apparently amaze that clinton be go along with it"
b"gee say they feed the 80-bit key through snefru-8 and take the first 60 bit of the result then use those 60 bit a the real key how do you figure out that each key be one of 2^20 `` equal '' key you can try a birthday attack but if the key can be change only once a second then you will need several lifetime to get reliable statistic somehow i think you could catch the nsa at this sort of skulduggery"
b"it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow house release your code to the cop your code be now no longer secure in the hand of cop and while i be sure most of the time they be good their security will not be a good a the escrow house what this effectively mean be that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligate to inform you that a tap be perform and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it be once again a code know only to the escrow house get the court order to reveal the key *also* make decipherable all *past* conversation which may be on tape or disk or whatver a i understand the proposal i could be wrong but see no mention of `` session key '' be the escrowed entity a the eff note this raise far issue about the fruit of one bust lead to incrimination in other area but be it any bad than the current unsecure system it becomes much bad of course if the government then us this `` clinton clipper '' to argue for restriction on unapproved encryption this be the main concern of most of u i think the camel 's nose in the tent etc and it may also become much bad if the ostensible security be increase thus allow great access to `` central office '' record by the government the conversation be encrypt who will object to let the government have access to them perhaps even automatically archive large fraction ... this be one of the main objection to the s.266 proposal that it would force telecom supplier to provide easy access for the government one the government have have access to month or year of your encrypt conversation now all it take be one misstep one violation that get them the paperwork need to decrypt *all* of them do we want anyone to have this kind of power -tim may whose sig block may get him bust in the new regime"
b"i have lurk here a bit lately and though some of the math be unknown to me found it interest i thought i would post an article i found in the saturday april 17 1993 toronto star 'clipper chip to protect privacy washington reuter president bill clinton announce yesterday a plan to plant a new `` clipper chip '' in every government telephone and computer line to prevent eavesdropping eventually the chip developed by the government 's national institute for standard and technology would be use by commercial and private electronics communication user the white house say that to assure privacy each device contain the encryption device would be assign two unique `` key '' number that will be need by government agency to decode message the attorney-general have be assign the task of arrange that the key be deposit in two `` key-escrow '' data base access to them would be limited to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the white house say in a statement -30- dan mckinnon"
b'regard nsa monitoring of u military code traffic on the contrary- the walker spy case be one where the kgb be give key a i recall --'
b"it look like dorothy denning 's wrong-headed idea have gotten to the administration even sooner than we fear lay long odds that it be the other way around clinton just pull this plan out of any bodily orifice the nsa have to have be work on it for year while possible that denning and other prominent people just happen to start argue for such a system it seem more likely that there be a suggestion involve if this guess be wrong i apologize sure dorothy denning be an honest person and lie to u simply think up a question to ask her about her involvement but be very careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no jesuitical evasion or a true but wholly mislead answer in this country mi5 be *experts* at answer these question for instance there be a british journalist jonathon moyle kill in south america a couple of year ago parliament ask `` be he an mi5 employee '' '' no '' turn out afterwards he paid therefore an employee they could equally have say he an agent he go abroad on his private business with no brief from mi5 but be interviewed and debriefed at length only *on his return*"
b"yes -- my error -- you will need the diff between the standard console.h and console.c supply with symantec 's think c 5.0.4 and the specially modify one that work with macpgp 2.2. i add the two diffs to the end of the signature file `` macpgp2.2srcsignature '' in pub/grady of netcom.com please download via anonymous ftp and use sed oops cut and paste fix-em-up will one of you mac-geniuses please port this to macapp or appmaker or ... grady"
b"i saw this article post in a local newsgroup i see it or any followup traffic relate to it in these group or other group which i subscribe to so i be post it here so others can read it check it out and comment on it and provide idea for handle these sort of thing i have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article but if accurate i find it extremely disturb especially in light of various abuse of the ssn number regard privacy i understand it be now to be require in ca to renew a driver license or to register a car and other proposal regard 'smart national identity card wiretap proposal and such one simply wonder what other gem be in the wing ready to be sprung on the people by our government perhaps suggestion and idea for prevent this and other such proposal from acquire the force of law would be useful the cost simply outweighs any possible benefit imo btw reading this make me think of some idea a prof denning have be promote in an even more disturb form

_________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 16 1993 statement by the press secretary the president today announce a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communication while meeting the legitimate need of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunication network and wireless communication link for too long there have be little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes compete interest of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policy have pit government against industry and the right of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology have be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption technology can help american protect business secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the `` clipper chip '' have be developed by government engineer the chip represent a new approach to encryption technology it can be use in new relatively inexpensive encryption device that can be attach to an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of data transmit electronically at the same time this technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal a `` key-escrow '' system will be establish to ensure that the '' clipper chip '' be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american each device contain the chip will have two unique 2 '' key '' number that will be need by authorize government agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two `` key-escrow '' data base that will be establish by the attorney general access to these key will be limited to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer access to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their finding the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology trend and explore new approach like the key-escrow system the president have direct government agency to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizen include the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purpose -- the ability of authorize official to access telephone call and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizen -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure need to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. company to manufacture and export high technology product the president have direct early and frequent consultation with affected industry the congress and group that advocate the privacy right of individual a policy option be developed 3 the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed network `` information superhighway '' will transmit video image hdtv program and huge data file a easily a today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use the administration be commit to policy that protect all american right to privacy while also protect them from those who break the law far information be

standard and technology 301 975-2758 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- question and answer about the clinton administration's telecommunication initiative q do this approach expand the authority of government agency to listen in on phone conversation a no `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entity responsible for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two part which be store separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow data bank a the two key-escrow data bank will be run by two independent entity at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agency will oversee the key-escrow data bank q how strong be the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security be a this system be more secure than many other voice encryption system readily available today while the algorithm will remain classify to protect the security of the key escrow system we be willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography expert to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential user that there be no unrecognized vulnerability q whose decision be it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agency be involve in this decision this approach have be endorse by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet official q who be consult the congress industry a we have on-going discussion with congress and industry on encryption issue and expect those discussion to intensify a we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed member of congress and industry leader on the decision related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturer a the government design and developed the key access encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product manufacturer product manufacturer can acquire the microcircuit from the chip manufacturer that produce them q who provide the `` clipper chip '' a mykotronx program it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturer the program function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device a we expect several manufacturer to consider incorporate the `` clipper chip '' into their device q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be willing to use legal remedy to restrict access to more powerful encryption device a this be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it be just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration be develop the administration be not say `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' a some country have effectively do nor be the u.s. say that `` every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there be a false `` tension '' create in the assessment that this issue be an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concern can be and in fact be harmoniously balance through a reason balance approach such a be propose with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption technique q what do this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect americans' privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware a voice encryption device be subject to export control requirement case-by-case review for each export be require to ensure appropriate use of these device the same be true for other encryption device one of the attraction of this technology be the protection it can give to u.s. company operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export license will be grant on a case-by-case basis for u.s. company seek to use these device to secure their own communication abroad we plan to review the possibility of permit wider exportability of these product -- -- -- -- -- end include article -- -- -- -- --"
b'my speculation do not include or depend upon a trapdoor in rsaref i do not believe that rsa would consent to such however there be other limitation in the concept of rsaref in which nsa have an interest it have an interest in a limited number of implementation i.e. target it have an interest in fix key or maximum modulus size it have a legitimate literally right to pursue such interest within bound it probably have a right to pursue those interest by covert mean at least it have the same right a the rest of u not to disclose all of it motif and intention institution be not self-aware they do not know their intention in any meaningful sense'
b"get rid of the key be actually pretty easy to do automatically on a communication link a oppose to storage where the key have to be retain somehow a long a the owner want to be able to retrieve the data the right way to do communication security be to generate a random session key with diffie hellman use it for a while and then destroy it once go there 's no get it back and no way to decrypt recording of the conversation to make sure you be attack by a man in the middle you have to authenticate your dh exchange the at t secure phone do this by display the dh key so you can compare them verbally over the phone this be nice and simple but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voice a well way be to authenticate the exchange with rsa since never use rsa for actual encryption compromise your rsa secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation and even that only until you revoke your public key they would still not be able to decrypt recording of prior conversation for which the session key have be destroyed convince that this be how the government 's own secure phone the stu-iii must work neat eh"
b"imagine if this be available during the 1992 election instead of clumsily search through the clinton passport file they could have just do a `` voice-grep '' a someone state earlier on his telephone conversation for the last 10 year not a lawyer and i even play one on tv but intuitively there's something wrong with have one 's word archive for possible future use against you this possibility frightens me more than any of the talk about the clipper chip right to cryptography etc afraid it just might -nhy --"
b'it just occur to me why the algorithm be secret if it be publish one could then build physically identical clone version of the chip that would interoperate with official clipper chip but the cloner provide the key to the escrow house hmmn or be there a technical hack that miss e.g how about if the chip be make unprogrammed but serialize and then ship to the two escrow house who programmed in their half of the key but in a way that require that secret key know only to the escrow house be instal a well without which clone version interoperate this be get awfully complicate but crypto for you'
b"question and answer about the clinton administration's telecommunication initiative q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entity responsible for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two part which be store separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system i apologize for be so dense but this sentence read a if it be lift from a luis bunuel screenplay be i miss something why on earth would drug smuggler even _use_ the device then obviously be use something like triple encryption de instead a long a alternative to clipper remain legal clipper accomplishes absolutely nothing zero a far a law enforcement be concerned the whole scheme be an absolute total incredible waste of government time and money a long a other encryption scheme that be any good remain legal in order for clipper to work a intend all strong cryptosystems have to be outlaw"
b"if clipper come to cellular phone along with legal proscription against use other cipher system on these phone a new and potentially dangerous class of crime be create criminal who very badly want inscrutable tactical communication specifically the terrorist and drug dealer who proponent of key escrow cite a threat will be highly motivate to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed once a suitable collection of device be steal criminal can communicate with impunity assume the cipher system carry no trapdoors apart from key escrow until and unless the compromise be discover by some other mean because life-is-cheap criminal be currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property luxury car it be reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property a cipher cellular phone just a we have see in the past with '' blue box '' technology and in the present with modify cellular phone we can expect to see among high-stakes criminal a lucrative market for steal cipher phone which can be use for a few day the high-stakes criminal will pay the life-is-cheap type substantial amount for steal instrument because a person be typically discover a miss or dead in a few day a steal instrument will be usable for only a few day there will be a continue demand for fresh phone fresh body in other word clipper and similar system have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and persistent threat to the general public on the other hand if a criminal be to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network the communication will at least stand out a be unusual and perhaps worthy of other mean of investigation finally because there be essentially no possibility of intercept in realtime the scrutable content of communication between steal instrument there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communication in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny once some criminal act be discover and the instrument involve have be identify while record and archive may not be feasible for wireline network it be probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio network the existence of these recording could open up vast potential for abuse"
b"well yet instead of thrash around on the do file system take it a step far write yourself a minimal `` file system '' program that be use to create/delete file en/decrypt them to ramdisk list a directory put the util password protect on a floppy the catch be that the storage space use by this util be not part of the do file system instead defrag your disk thus pack all allocate cluster into cluster 0-n. then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth file system or leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that be not assign to do another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant file do system file for instance due to do allocate a minimum storage unit of a `` cluster '' there be unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of it associate cluster these dead space could be concatenate and use to hold your stealth file system now you have a situation where no encrypt data `` appear '' on your disk at all"
b"if brad 's analysis be correct it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm be be kept secret this will prevent competitor from come out with clipper-compatible phone which lack the government- instal `` back door '' the strategy brad describes will only work a long a the only way to get compatible phone be to have one with the government chip it would be nice from the point of view of personal privacy if brad turn out to be right a long a people still have the power to provide their own encryption in place of or in addition to the clipper privacy be still possible but the word of several passage in the announcement make me doubt whether this will turn out to be true"

b'it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow house release your code to the cop your code be now no longer secure in the hand of cop and while i be sure most of the time they be good their security will not be a good a the escrow house what this effectively mean be that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligate to inform you that a tap be perform and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it be once again a code know only to the escrow house do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charge be laid in many way it would be a positive step if they have to judge set time limit on warrant i assume at the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip if we go with this scheme which i be not sure i agree with'

b"not necessarily be think about this and if this chip/scheme be to provide any real security there must be some sort of key exchange either use a public-key encryption scheme or use a key exchange scheme like diffie-hellman if there 's an out-of-band transmission of a share session key then what protects that band from eavesdropping if the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both user then what 's the point of go to the trouble of have some complicate key-depositories just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call now probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key use by anyone anywhere right so probably there will be some way of get these key verify this might be a digitally- sign by the chip manufacturer copy of the public key in this unit store by this unit it might also be an online directory with access to everyone 's public key this would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme of course presumably if you use your designate key you get a verify connection to other standard chip it might be useful to have a modify chip which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair or some other key pair and verification scheme unfortunately this would not allow you to call most people and establish secure communication ..."

b"i be not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic thing seem evident to me thing which this clinton clipper do not address the all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusion base on what i have see the membership of this group except for two notable person agree to if anything bad be possible by the government in theory it almost always end up happen in fact so the key be to make abuse impossible question authority and remember power do corrupt i think one have to regard this whole idea in the sense that it will be expand to include other data form such a data transfer and store data and a such should be treat a if it be expand or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop use clipper a a precident there be a hint of that in the proposal remember that say please bear with me i be not very articulate so i take more word to say what others could say much more briefly thank you a i suggest this be now the hint be in the proposal that this or similar proposal be be consider for other form of encryption such a data transfer data file and such largely dependent on how this thing be accepted or fly i think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when not if it get expand to other area than cellular phone i think this be guaranteed to happen if this proposal get by salami politics it have be and be use in several other area it be certain to be use here government be not go to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to 'court order require have proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee if the case warrant they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renew contempt charge so it be not deny the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuse to divulge the mean to access the info this be not protect under the fifth one can be force to perform act that would result in divulge incriminate evidence so block restriction on private encryption be not prevent legitimate law enforcement it do make illegitimate law enforcement a bunch more difficult especially fishing expedition without the target 's knowlege give up the right to be safe from that that should be non-negotiable and clinton and co. know it which be probably why they quietly developed this thing figure if they get it this far they can ram it on through how come those consult could be roughly described a `` u insider '' they can not quietely impliment it though when they ban other scheme to ensure it exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone buy into it have government really earn that kind of trust past or future to be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that be to make abuse impossible not 'unlikely' or 'difficult so what one could use information gain by re-use of the key save after the last case be finish or other mean master key backdoor easily broken algorithm to find other evidence which give to a judge would authorize a tap which have be possible otherwise this have be the more common manner of abuse of wiretap in the past ... for local cop this might be workable to keep them honest but the fed have a workaround somehow bet on it do anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme nsa can not listen in on scan for keywords either easily defeat in realtime or via a 'master key i sure this whole thing sound like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case in the past eavesdropping be rather easy with or without a court order i think the law enforcement community have become a bit spoil and will resist change that require them to revert to use old-fashioned detective work i just find it somewhat surprising come from a bunch that care so much about civil and individual right that `` put people first '' the question be `` put people first '' to where with the innards not be reveal how be one to be sure there doesn't exist a 'master key for use by nsa etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversation they routinely monitor without a specific court order remember the cellular phone limitiation be only temporary bet on it and so far i have not heard about police tell people that they have be tapped and nothing incriminate be found what be to keep them from simply keep the key on file for 'next time after awhile they would have quite a collection kept especially for folk they deem 'disruptive and if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unless it be an rsa scheme remember nixon year need for court order really slow them down it and unless the escrow account be not government control fat chance i see one end up be under say treasury the other under justice it could be worth some serious buck to some folk to get key to a competitor 's clinton clipper or descendent when this idea be expand to be use for all non-government encryption enough buck would get one the key or the innards for this algorithm perhaps not an important concern but give past government behavior and the other problem ... what will one do when it be expand to data storage encryption you can bet that if clipper be accepted that will be next on the agenda it be even hint at in the proposal read it carefully ... expect the argumet `` well if you get nothing to hide ... '' fine then use that argument one should not object to video camera be instal in every room of one 's home grant an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle hold private stuff should remain private even from a govt fishing expedition and laws/rules may change in the future a to 'safeguards when it come to the fed government safeguard be pretty meaningless if they want to do/get something work so hard to give up some rather treasure right or establish bad precidents please the price could be hell to pay later people would fight law forbid more now but in say two year because we have this 'crisis situation which must be address by some 'drastic action just this add reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide ... etc please buy into it if the clinton clipper be so very good why not make it algrithm public so many people can exchange idea and examine it rather than a few isolated 'respected expert respect by whom for what perhaps a certain professor who like key bank would be one of the select expert ... this do seem to expand on some idea the person be advocate if i recall how would anybody know that what the expert examine be the same a what will end up be use in the clipper chip if it be kept secret perhaps the clipper will use a cripple version with a 'master key provision or feature not present in the version subject for study and evaluation by the expert and who chooses the expertes the government no conflict of interest there ... and it a requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have it effectiveness reduce by have the algrorithm widely know i be lead to believe that one should assume the other side have everything you have except for the key s ... i recall idea present to this group be reject if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret ... another question since it be a safe bet this clipper thing would not be use for government security they be regard it a not real secure but `` good enough '' for common folk i think i would like to see a full description not a pr non-statement of just what `` good enough '' mean i think when say how strong it be `` good enough '' really mean `` not very '' the excuse that other country have these restriction be not acceptable other country do not have our bill of right and constitution which the people not the government of those other country often regard with envy what we have a right they have a revokable privilege and if we expect to retain those right and protection we must not allow them to be gutted because we just get ta have this thing to 'fight crime we have allready have our bill of right pretty much torn to shred we should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause instead we should be try to repair the damage our crime problem may have a number of cause but `` too many right and safeguard '' be not a signifigant one a broken court system and poor police work be a much more signifigant cause a have '' too many right '' disregard address the root cause for crime etc btw those who suggest that this be just an attack on clinton believe this i would be go ballistic reagardless who seriously propose this thing it be just another step in a gradual erosion of our right under the constitution or bill of right the last couple of decade have be a non-stop series of end-runs around the protection of the constitution it have to stop now be a good a time a any if it too late allready"
b'clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption currently when you send an encrypt message an opponent can usually tell 1 that you be use encryption 2 which encryption method you be use because that information be usually in the clear with clipper most opponent will only know that you be send clipper-text they know that your clipper-text be itself encode only those few opponent who get your clipper-keys will know that your message be double encrypt ... kind of like a safety deposit box contain a lock box so just think of replacement for clipper also think of front end carl'

agent 1 enters an 80-bit value s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value s2 these value serve a seed to generate key for a sequence of serial number to generate the unit key for a serial

part u1 the second disk be similar but contains the u2 value the third disk contains the unit key u. agent 1 take the first disk and agent 2 take the second disk the third disk be use to program the chip after the chip be programmed all information be discard from the vault and the agent leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information be left behind the protocol may be change slightly so that four people be in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seed s1 and s2 and the second two the escrow agent would take the disk back to the escrow agency the escrow agency have a yet to be determine but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement have be authorize to tap an encrypt line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communication line let u assume that the tap be in place and that they have determine that the line be encrypt with clipper they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key f. this give them e k u n. they will then take a warrant identify

statement by the press secretary the president today announce a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communication while meeting the legitimate need of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunication network and wireless communication link for too long there have be little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes compete interest of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policy have pit government against industry and the right of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology have be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption technology can help american protect business secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the `` clipper chip '' have be developed by government engineer the chip represent a new approach to encryption technology it can be use in new relatively inexpensive encryption device that can be attach to an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of data transmit electronically at the same time this technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal a `` key-escrow '' system will be establish to ensure that the '' clipper chip '' be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american each device contain the chip will have two unique 2 '' key '' number that will be need by authorize government agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two `` key-escrow '' data base that will be establish by the attorney general access to these key will be limited to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer access to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their finding the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology trend and explore new approach like the key-escrow system the president have direct government agency to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizen include the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purpose -- the ability of authorize official to access telephone call and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizen -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure need to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. company to manufacture and export high technology product the president have direct early and frequent consultation with affected industry the congress and group that advocate the privacy right of individual a policy option be developed 3 the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed network `` information superhighway '' will transmit video image hdtv program and huge data file a easily a today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly

the clinton administration's telecommunication initiative q do this approach expand the authority of government agency to listen in on phone conversation a no `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entity responsible for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two part which be store separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow data bank a the two key-escrow data bank will be run by two independent entity at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agency will oversee the key-escrow data bank q how strong be the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security be a this system be more secure than many other voice encryption system readily available today while the algorithm will remain classify to protect the security of the key escrow system we be willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography expert to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential user that there be no unrecognized vulnerability q whose decision be it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agency be involve in this decision this approach have be endorse by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet official q who be consult the congress industry a we have on-going discussion with congress and industry on encryption issue and expect those discussion to intensify a we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed member of congress and industry leader on the decision related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturer a the government design and developed the key access encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product manufacturer product manufacturer can acquire the microcircuit from the chip manufacturer that produce them q who provide the `` clipper chip '' a mykotronx program it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturer the program function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device a we expect several manufacturer to consider incorporate the `` clipper chip '' into their device q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be willing to use legal remedy to restrict access to more powerful encryption device a this be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it be just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration be develop the administration be not say `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' a some country have effectively do nor be the u.s. say that `` every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there be a false `` tension '' create in the assessment that this issue be an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concern can be and in fact be harmoniously balance through a reason balance approach such a be propose with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption technique q what do this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect americans' privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware"
b"even if what brad say turn out to be accurate you can bet that the administration will have make it `` very clear '' to the vendor that `` it would very much be in their best interest '' to institute a `` voluntary '' policy of refuse to sell anything but clinton cripple equip equipment to anyone other than `` authorize government agency and law enforcement '' or individual and corporation who `` have be be determine by the administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis '' for an effective system note that this be very much like the language use in many gun control bills/laws the administration be push for or otherwise support the logic and actual rationale a oppose to the excuse that get fed to the medium be the same in both case only the item or technology in question be different i think this be no accident it come from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people not the people control the government that the unconnected citizen be not sophisticated enough to know what be best for them so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... `` we know best ... '' and the idea that that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping or unlawful attack be totally unacceptable to people with this outlook combine this all with push for national identity card with 'smart chip to encode anything they please internal passport under the guise of streamline the state people 's health care system and with you can be certain more jewel yet to come and one see an extremely ominous trend so what if `` 1984 '' will be ten year late ... it still be turn out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy ... unless a lot of people wake up and in a hurry one should always have every red warn light and bell and danger flag come up when the government seek to set itself apart in regard to right etc from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen or should we now be say 'subject instead ... why should n't the average person have a good secure system of data security not dependent on nebulous 'safeguards for maintain that security why should n't the average person be able to defend himself from an agency go rogue 0i be sure the fed could break into any data they really want to but it would take some work and use the same logic one should not be allow to have a good safe unless a duplicate of the key s or combination be submit for 'safekeeping by the government i really see a difference philosophically encrypt data sure evaporate not with such high-tech tool a a tape recorder ..."
b'a of yet there have be no description of the general principle behind the clipper proposal for example be this a public key system or a private key system if the latter then i see how the system could work give that the key be tie to the device and not the person far the escrowed 80-bit key be split into two 40-bit chunk i would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunk and a reasonable key-search machine would allow you to read the traffic not suggest that this be a deliberate weakness of the system but it do make you think of course this be easily fixable by give out two 80-bit chunk which could be x-ored to generate the real 80-bit key'
b'presumably the key split be so that no one group control the privacy of the key and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from both agent however if one agent wish to break the crypto without the cooperation of the other agent a 40-bit key be not go to stand in the way of a brute force attack if an agency for example the nsa be to hold one of the two key-halves then i imagine they really need the other half of the key to start listen in or be that the point grin this be not to imply at all that i like the idea of the rest of the system'
b'with all the talk about this clipper chip i have developed one question ... how do it work if you use this then how do it get decrypt on the other end do the other party receive the phone call/mail/etc have to know some code to undo it do i use a different method for call one party than i would for another if the other party can decrypt it that mean that someone else could also i assume that if everyone have a different key the only use would be store secure data for later retrieval by the same key this seem like a fundamental question to me but i have very little experience with cryptosystems other than de if someone could give me an explanation a to how it would be use remember that i have have little experience with this sort of thing it would be very much appreciate'
b"... i claim to be a crypto analyist ... there a whole lot of good literature on the subject and the best people seem to publish their work but i rather doubt the approach such folk use be brute force sorry to have imply that in my previous post the history of these thing be folk find clever way of limit the search and bang from there i guess my real problem with skipjack be i can not believe nsa would make publicly available a system they break if they want ... it just in their charter remember de come from ibm not nsa and when first publish be give a useful life of 20 year ... i think we be well past that point now remember base on the size of the nsa budget they spend a lot more on the technology of decryption than most computer company spend on r d i have to imagine their stuff be real interest ... a friend who once work for them he be dead now say he always enjoy monitoring sac 's strategic air command crypto traffic and i rather suspect that stuff be a bit more complex than skipjack or be it the military get the stuff from the nsa just like we get skipjack from them btw folk nsa be give the key and the walker spy case show for some of the system the kgb need them either"
b'i think i should also point out that the mystical de engine be know plaintext engine unless you add a ton of really smart hardware assume the ton of smart hardware it really have to be that smart'

product cipher what make a product cipher secure what be some group-theoretic property of product cipher what can be proven about the security of a product cipher how be block cipher use to encrypt data longer than the block size can symmetric block cipher be use for message authentication what exactly be de what be triple de what be differential cryptanalysis how be nsa involve in the design of de be de available in software be de available in hardware can de be use to protect classify information what be `` ecb '' `` cbc '' `` cfb '' and `` ofb '' encryption what be a product cipher a product cipher be a block cipher that iterates several weak operation such a substitution transposition modular addition/multiplication and linear transformation a `` block cipher '' just mean a cipher that encrypts a block of data -- -8 byte say -- -all at once then go on to the next block the notion of product cipher be due to shannon sha49 example of modern product cipher include lucifer sor84 de nbs77 sp-networks kam78 loki bro90 feal shi84 pe lai90 khufu and khafre me91a the so-called feistel cipher be a class of product cipher which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext half after each round lucifer de loki and feal be example of feistel cipher the follow table compare the main parameter of several product cipher cipher block length key bit number of round lucifer 128 128 16 de 64 56 16 loki 64 64 16 feal 64 128 2^x x 5 pe 64 128 8 what make a product cipher secure nobody know how to prove mathematically that a product cipher be completely secure so in practice one begin by demonstrate that the cipher `` look highly random '' for example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key meyer mey78 have show that at least 5 round of de be require to guarantee such a dependence in this sense a product cipher should act a a `` mix '' function which combine the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion the fix per-round substitution of the product cipher be refer to a s-boxes for example lucifer have 2 s-boxes and de have 8 s-boxes the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these s-boxes a list of partial design criterion for the s-boxes of de which apply to s-boxes in general may be found in brown bro89 and brickell et al bri86 what be some group-theoretic property of product cipher let e be a product cipher that map n-bit block to n-bit block let e_k x be the encryption of x under key k. then for any fix k the map send x to e_k x be a permutation of the set of n-bit block denote this permutation by p_k the set of all n-bit permutation be call the symmetric group and be write s_ 2^n the collection of all these permutation p_k where k range over all possible key be denote e s_ 2^n if e be a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e s_ 2^n to generate a large subset of s_ 2^n coppersmith and grossman cop74 have show that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternate group a_ 2^n give a sufficient number of round the alternate group be half of the symmetric group it consists of all `` even '' permutation i.e. all permutation which can be write a an even number of swap even and goldreich eve83 be able to extend these result to show that feistel cipher can generate a_ 2^n give a sufficient number of round the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group-theoretic property of a cipher multiple encipherment be an extension over single encipherment if for key k1 k2 there do not exist a third key k3 such that e_k2 e_k1 x == e_ k3 x ** which indicates that encrypt twice with two independent key k1 k2 be equal to a single encryption under the third key k3 if for every k1 k2 there exists a k3 such that eq ** be true then we say that e be a group this question of whether de be a group under this definition be extensively study by sherman kaliski and rivest she88 in their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that de be not a group in fact de be not a group cam93 what can be proven about the security of a product cipher recall from above that p_k be a permutation produce by e under some key k. the goal of the designer of e be to ensure that p_k appear to be a random element of s_ 2^n the symmetric group let r be an element of s_ 2^n select randomly we will say that p_k and r be indistinguishable if an observer give p_k and r in some order can not distinguish between these two permutation in polynomial time that be with time bound resource the observer can not determine which of the permutation be produce by e the optimal decision be no well than simply guess luby and rackoff lub88 have show that a class of feistel cipher be secure in this sense when the round mapping be replace by random boolean function how be block cipher use to encrypt data longer than the block size there be four standard `` mode of operation '' and numerous non-standard one a well the standard mode of operation be define in the u.s. department of commerce federal information processing standard fips 81 publish in 1980. see the question about `` ecb '' below for more detail although they be define for the de block cipher the `` mode of operation '' can be use with any block cipher can symmetric block cipher be use for message authentication one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he do or do not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message be alter or unaltered since generation but one can not prove these thing to another without reveal the key and thereafter that key can not be use to prove anything about any message that be authenticate use that key see ansi x3.106-1983 and fips 113 1985 for a standard method of message authentication use de what exactly be de de be the u.s. government 's data encryption standard a product cipher that operates on 64-bit block of data use a 56-bit key it be define in fips 46-1 1988 which supersedes fips 46 1977 fips be federal information processing standard publish by ntis de be identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm dea define in ansi x3.92-1981 what be triple de triple de be a product cipher which like de operates on 64-bit data block there be several form each of which us the de cipher 3 time some form use two 56-bit key some use three the `` de mode of operation '' may also be use with triple-des some people refer to e k1 d k2 e k1 x a triple-des this method be define in chapter 7.2 of the ansi standard x9.17-1985 `` financial institution key management '' and be intend for use in encrypt de key and iv for `` automate key distribution '' it formal name be `` encryption and decryption of a single key by a key pair '' but it be reference in other standard document a ede that standard say section 7.2.1 `` key encrypt key may be a single dea key or a dea key pair key pair shoud be use where additional security be need e.g. the data protect by the key s have a long security life a key pair shall not be encrypt or decrypt use a single key '' others use the term `` triple-des '' for e k1 d k2 e k3 x or e k1 e k2 e k3 x one of u carl ellison keep advocate de triple use in the form e k1 tran e k2 tran e k3 compress x where each de instance have it own key and iv for cbc mode and tran have be post on sci.crypt it be a large-block transposition program take it key from the data stream itself so that it be not an encryption program on it own part what be differential cryptanalysis differential cryptanalysis be a statistical attack that can be apply to any iterate mapping ie any mapping which be base on a repeat round function the method be recently popularize by biham and shamir bih91 but coppersmith have remark that the s-boxes of de be optimize against this attack some 20 year ago this method have prove effective against several product cipher notably feal bi91a differential cryptanalysis be base on observe a large number of ciphertexts y y whose correspond plaintexts x x satisfy a know difference d x+x where be componentwise xor in the basic biham-shamir attack 2^ 47 such plaintext pair be require to determine the key for de substantially few pair be require if de be truncate to 6 or 8 round in these case the actual key can be recover in a matter of minute use a few thousand pair for full de this attack be impractical because it require so many know plaintexts the work of biham and shamir on de reveal several startle observation on the algorithm most importantly if the key schedule be remove from de and a 16*48 768-bit key be use the key could be recover in less than 2^ 64 step thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to de far the s-boxes of de be extremely sensitive in that change even single entry in these table yield significant improvement in the differential attack adi shamir be quote to say nytimes oct 13 1991 `` i would say that contrary to what some people believe there be no evidence of tamper with the de so that the basic design be weaken '' how be nsa involve in the design of de accord to kinnucan kin78 tuchman a member of the group that developed de at ibm be quote a say `` we developed the de algorithm entirely within ibm use ibmers the nsa do not dictate a single wire '' tuchman and meyer another developer of de spent a year break cipher and find weakness in lucifer they then spent two year strengthen lucifer `` their basic approach be to look for strong substitution permutation and key schedule function ... ibm have classify the note contain the selection criterion at the request of the nsa ... the nsa told u we have inadvertently reinvent some of the deep secret it us to make it own algorithm explains tuchman '' on the other hand a document call `` involvement of the nsa in the development of de unclassified summary of the united state select committee on intelligence '' print in the ieee communication magazine p53-55 1978 state `` in the development of de nsa convince ibm that a reduce keysize be sufficient indirectly assist in the development of the s-box structure and certify that the final de algorithm be to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness '' clearly the key size be reduce at the insistence of the nsa the article far state that the nsa do not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameter which in some sense resolve the apparent

b"*desparately* prefer it if we rehash the same argument that go on ad infinitum last time especially true for sci.crypt for that matter create alt.privacy.clipper since the traffic be appear in *many* different group right now go to focus here on some technical aspect of the plan hence my followup to sci.crypt frankly if not an absolutist your feeling may turn on some of these issue for example -- with an 80-bit key simply splitting it into two 40-bit piece be much less acceptable than other scheme because it mean that if just one repository be shall we say overly pliable a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bit of key i need not point out in this newsgroup that pretty easy to do by exhaustive search a slightly more complex scheme -- xor-ing the key with a random number and then with it complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys neither of which be useful alone that variant be much more resistant to attack clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect the subkeys even more other thought ... some people have note the size and complexity of the database necessary but the id string the phone emit could be their back door key double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public key for that matter they could do that only with session key and have no back door at all in that case the fbi would have to bring every intercept to the repository to be decrypt this would answer many of the objection along the line of `` how do you make sure they stop '' we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap but with a digitally-signed record of the time phone number etc of the call that provide proof to the escrow agent that the tap be do in compliance with the term of the warrant i can suggest other variation too suppose each clipper chip have 100 public key pair each would be use ~10 time after which need more key material not a bad idea in any event this could be use to enforce time limit or rather usage limit on each warrant the key the repository agent would deliver last for very long i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself be secure apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when already get the back door -- i think that the government be still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage especially aim at commercial target this scheme let the spook have their cake and eat it too heard rumor over the year that some faction within nsa be unhappy with de because it be too good not that they crack it but it be much too expensive to do so a easily a want keep the detail secret so that others build their own implementation without the back door"

sophisticated encryption technology have be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption technology can help american protect business secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the `` clipper chip '' have be developed by government engineer the chip represent a new approach to encryption technology it can be use in new relatively inexpensive encryption device that can be attach to an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of data transmit electronically at the same time this technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal a `` key-escrow '' system will be establish to ensure that the '' clipper chip '' be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american each device contain the chip will have two unique 2 '' key '' number that will be need by authorize government agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two `` key-escrow '' data base that will be establish by the attorney general access to these key will be limited to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer access to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their finding the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology trend and explore new approach like the key-escrow system the president have direct government agency to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizen include the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purpose -- the ability of authorize official to access telephone call and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizen -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure need to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. company to manufacture and export high technology product the president have direct early and frequent consultation with affected industry the congress and group that advocate the privacy right of individual a policy option be developed 3 the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed network `` information superhighway '' will transmit video image hdtv program and huge data file a easily a today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use the administration be commit to policy that protect all american right to privacy while also protect them from those who break the law far information be

standard and technology 301 975-2758 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- question and answer about the clinton administration's telecommunication initiative q do this approach expand the authority of government agency to listen in on phone conversation a no `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entity responsible for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two part which be store separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow data bank a the two key-escrow data bank will be run by two independent entity at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agency will oversee the key-escrow data bank q how strong be the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security be a this system be more secure than many other voice encryption system readily available today while the algorithm will remain classify to protect the security of the key escrow system we be willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography expert to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential user that there be no unrecognized vulnerability q whose decision be it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agency be involve in this decision this approach have be endorse by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet official q who be consult the congress industry a we have on-going discussion with congress and industry on encryption issue and expect those discussion to intensify a we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed member of congress and industry leader on the decision related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturer a the government design and developed the key access encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product manufacturer product manufacturer can acquire the microcircuit from the chip manufacturer that produce them q who provide the `` clipper chip '' a mykotronx program it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturer the program function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device a we expect several manufacturer to consider incorporate the `` clipper chip '' into their device q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be willing to use legal remedy to restrict access to more powerful encryption device a this be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it be just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration be develop the administration be not say `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' a some country have effectively do nor be the u.s. say that `` every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there be a false `` tension '' create in the assessment that this issue be an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concern can be and in fact be harmoniously balance through a reason balance approach such a be propose with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption technique q what do this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect americans' privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware"

b"the problem with `` let 's assume '' reason be that take to the extreme and close you arrive at `` let 's assume this be perfectly ok. '' the assumption you make be big one if the system be really secure then why do the government have to keep the algorithm secret there be plenty of encryption algorithm that depend upon nondisclosure to be secure so why in the world use one that do there be reason of course but i certainly think of any honest one next you assume we can `` trust '' the escrow house but the last time i checked every single branch of government have experienced unauthorized disclosure corruption and even fabrication of supposedly secure data the govt be say `` yeah but now serious so you can trust u '' bullcrypt and finally although you state it explicitly you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country be safe and reasonable the case in ventura county of a man shot and kill by officer serve a deliberately fraudulant warrant tell me that the govt have a long way to go on this score remember that all this be to catch the drug dealer right a others have point out the current proposal will if deployed render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than uncle sam 's brand who will be able to afford and be sufficiently motivate to purchase this expensive inconvenient high protection somebody with lot of extra cash ... the follow be more true than ever `` when strong encryption be outlaw only outlaw will have strong encryption ''"

b"archive-name ripem/attacks last-update 31 mar 93 21:00:00 -0500 some possible attack on ripem -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this be a living list of potential weakness to keep your eye open for when use ripem for secure electronic mail it do not go into great detail and be almost certainly not exhaustive obviously many of the weakness be weakness of cryptographically secure mail in general and will pertain to secure mail program other than ripem it be maintain by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs.indiana.edu it be post monthly to a variety of news group followup pertain specifically to ripem should go to alt.security.ripem cryptanalysis attack -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- break rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key in which case he could read any mail encrypt to you and sign message with your private key rsa be generally believe to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic technique even a standard key about 516 bit with ripem be long enough to render this impractical bar a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factor break de would allow an attacker to read any give message since the message itself be encrypt with de it would not allow an attacker to claim to be you de have only 56 bit in it key and thus could conceivably be compromise by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agency have such money to devote to simply read one message since each message have a different de key the work for each message would remain high key management attack -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- steal your private key would allow the same benefit a break rsa to safeguard it it be encrypt with a de key which be derive from a passphrase you type in however if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snoop network packet tap line or whatever he could break the whole scheme the main risk be that of transfer either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link so do that run ripem on a trust machine preferably one sit right in front of you ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office which nobody else have physical access to fooling you into accept a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into send secret message to him rather than to the real recipient if the enemy can fool your intend recipient a well he could re-encrypt the message with the other bogus public key and pas them along it be important to get the proper public key of other people the most common mechanism for this be finger assume the opponent have not compromise router or daemon or such finger can be give a fair amount of trust the strong method of key authentication be to exchange key in person however this be not always practical have other people `` vouch for you '' by signing a statement contain your key be possible although ripem have feature for do this a automatically a pgp ripem do generate and check md5 fingerprint of public key in the key file they may be exchange via a separate channel for authentication playback attack -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- even if an opponent can not break the cryptography an opponent could still cause difficulty for example suppose you send a message with mic-only a pem mode which do not provide disclosure protection to alice which say `` ok let 's do that '' your opponent intercept it and now resends it to bob who now have a message which be authenticate a from you tell him to do that of course he may interpret it in an entirely different context or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figure it would be see differently at a later time or the opponent could change the originator-name to himself register your public key a his and send a message hop the recipient will send him return mail indicate perhaps even quote the unknown message to defeat playback attack the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique identifier typically the date a good front-end script for ripem should do this automatically imho a a recipient you should be sure that the originator-name header and the sender indicate within the plaintext be the same that you really be a recipient and that the message be not an old one some this also can and should be automate the author of this faq have make a modest attempt at automate the process of generate and check encapsulate header the program be include in the standard distribution in the utils directory local attack -- -- -- -- -- -- clearly the security of ripem can not be great than the security of the machine where the encryption be perform for example under unix a super-user could manage to get at your encrypt mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext depend how store in addition the link between you and the machine run ripem be an extension of that if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine which you be connect to via network or bad yet modem an eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your passphrase ripem should only be execute on system you trust obviously in the extreme case ripem should only be use on your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else have access to which have only carefully examine software know to be free of virus and so on however there 's a very real trade-off between convenience and security here a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keep private key and the statically link of course executable on a floppy disk some people will keep ripem on a multi-user system but when dial in over an insecure line they will download the message to their own system and perform the ripem decryption there however the security provide by such a mechanism be somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in just give away the store since the attacker can now log in a you and install trap in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line this will likely remain the situation a long a most system use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key so that potential correspondent can be aware what level of precaution be in place some people use two key a short one which be not carefully manage for ordinary use and a longer one which be treat with great care for critical correspondence untrusted partner attack -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ripem 's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key correspond to the public key use to encrypt the data may read the traffic however once someone with that key get the message she may always make whatever kind of transformation she wish there exist no cryptographic barrier to a recipient say take an encrypt message and convert it to a mic-only message sign by you and readable by anyone although ripem do not provide this functionality indeed the late pem draft i have see specifically state that such transformation should be possible to allow forward function to work"

b"true in theory in practice the technology of cellular phone will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency path depends on they key a i understand it to it *could* be make effectively impossible to record once it hit land you can record it if you have telco access the telco suppose to give that without a warrant the rule today but even so the evidence would not be admissible i think unless the judge so order i think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal cop record today 's plain cellular call and then ask a judge `` hey can we have permission to listen to those tape '' can they yes that be a major concern but i think that they think they can win just by have 99.5 of the usa use this system they even have to care about the cautious .5 left they catch the really smart crook anyway john gotti who would have to be retard not to realize he be likely to be wiretapped glibly chat away on his tapped phone about murder plan why in jail now hard to believe but true this scheme can succeed without law forbid more which people would fight a lot harder they like this enough that they be drop the so call `` digital telephony '' proposal accord to rumour however the meaning of that be complex since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco system and that require a bit of work"
b"the key question be whether non-clipper encryption will be make illegal the clear middle ground imply by these statement be to say that american have the right to clipper encryption but not to unbreakable encryption this implies that ultimately non-clipper strong encryption must become illegal a an aside the language here jarring all this talk about '' harmonious balance '' when talk about take away people's right to communication privacy although the article emphasizes voice communication data and mail encryption be mention a well it look like the bad nightmare raise by dorothy denning 's proposal be come true if the government continue on this course i imagine that we will see strong cryptography make illegal encryption program for disk file and email a well a software to allow for encrypt voice communication will be distribute only through the '' underground '' people will have to learn how to hide the fact that they be protect their privacy shock and frighten to see that this be actually happen here"

b'first of all the chip do that it run at 16 megabits/second which be far beyond what you need for voice obviously intend for data a well and on high-speed line at that second -- what advantage be there to do the processing in the phone i care how fancy that chip be not a fancy a the roomful of analyzer at fort meade run the program have 5 year from now they update every clipper chip out there'
b"i know but a willing to speculate a anyone several people have suggest that the chip use public-key cryptography another possibility be to use diffie-hellman key exchange or some other algorithm which have a similar effect dh allows both end to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography something like de for the encryption how could the `` back door '' key work in this system i can see a few possibility one be that the dh-like algorithm have the property that the session key can be deduce by an eavesdropper who know the back door key for one or possibly both communicant perhaps the random number use in the dh be seed by the back door key or some such another possibility a be suggest here earlier be that the chip simply broadcast the session key encrypt with the chip 's own internal secret key in this system the back door key be secret key usable for decrypt this session key broadcast actually the chip's secret key need to be a public key in this usage but can be identical to the secret back-door key this proposal seem most straightforward to me still another possibility be that the encryption algorithm use for the message itself have a `` dual key '' property that possession of either of two key can be use to decrypt it one key would be the session key from the dh exchange and the other would be the back door key for the chip worth note that one of the proposal dorothy denning raise during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last november and december be a variation on diffie-hellman in which a third party would participate in derive the session key this quite fit into what we know of how clipper work but it hint that those who have early knowledge of clipper or whose think be somehow synchronize with clipper designer may have have diffie-hellman on their mind"

be consider legal advice or anything other than one layperson 's opinion if you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer preferably one with experience in patent law export regulation or whatever area of law be in question list of question -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 what be ripem 2 how can i get ripem 3 will ripem run on my machine 4 will ripem work with my mailer 5 what be rsa 6 what be de 7 what be a fingerprint like md5 8 what be pem 9 what 's this about distribute and authenticate key 10 it a bad idea to use patent algorithm in standard like pem 11 what about rsadsi/pkp 12 why do all ripem public key look very similar 13 what be pgp 14 what about rpem 15 what be mime 16 what be tis/pem 17 i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem ... question and answer -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 what be ripem ripem be a not yet complete but useful implementation of privacy enhance mail pem ripem allows your electronic mail to have the four security facility provide by pem disclosure protection optional originator authenticity message integrity measure and non-repudiation of origin always see `` what be pem '' ripem be write primarily by mark riordan mrr scss3.cl.msu.edu most of the code be in the public domain except for the rsa routine which be a library call rsaref license from rsa data security inc. the current version of ripem be 1.0.5 the current version of the macintosh port of ripem be 0.7 2 how can i get ripem ripem us the library of cryptographic routine rsaref which be consider munition and thus be export-restricted from distribution to person who be not citizen or permanent resident in the u.s or canada without an export license no such license have be obtain nor would one likely be grant unless the rsa key exchange be shorten to 512 bit and the symmetric cipher change to something weaker than de there be some suggestion that this situation may change now that clinton be in office the author request in the readme file that this law not be violate please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada this be a personal request from me the author of ripem and a condition of your use of ripem note that rsaref be not in the public domain and a license for it be include with the distribution you should read it before use ripem ripem be available via anonymous ftp to citizen and permanent resident in the u.s. from rsa.com cd to rsaref/ and read the readme file for info note that the non-rsaref portion of ripem be not a product of rsa data security incorporate they merely be help distribute it ripem a well a some other crypt stuff have it `` home site '' on ripem.msu.edu which be open to non-anonymous ftp for user in the u.s. and canada who be citizen or permanent resident to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub/crypt/ and read the file getting_access for convenience binary for many architecture be available here in addition to the full source tree 3 will ripem run on my machine probably it have already be port to ms-dos and most flavor of unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc port to macintosh include a standard unix-style port and a rather nice mac-like port write by raymond lau author of stuffit more port be expect and help of user be invite 4 will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface be will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the user guide include with the distribution discus way to use ripem with many popular mailer include berkeley mush elm and mh code be also include in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emacs if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe be convenient to use secure and may be useful to others feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem 5 what be rsa rsa be a crypto system which be asymmetric or public-key this mean that there be two different related key one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one can not reasonably be derive from the other you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key need to decrypt it note that the `` message '' sent with rsa be normally just the de key to the real plaintext see `` what be de '' note that the above only provide for disclosure protection for originator authenticity message integrity and non-repudiation of origin service to be implement the fingerprint of the message see `` what be a fingerprint like md5 '' be encrypt with the sender 's private key the recipient or a dispute-resolving authority can use the sender 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and be not alter rsa be name for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invent it to find out lot more about rsa and modern cryptography in general ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ some information also may be in sci.crypt 6 what be de de be the data encryption standard a widely use symmetric or secret-key crypto system unlike rsa de us the same key to encrypt and decrypt message however de be much faster than rsa ripem us both de and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with de use that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient 's public rsa key and include the result in the letter allow the recipient to recover the de key de be sometimes consider weak because it be somewhat old and us a key length consider too short by modern standard however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent small than a large corporation or government agency it be not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric cipher in the near future because there be a strong feel that pem should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problem with interoperability 7 what be a fingerprint like md5 md5 be a message digest algorithm produce by rsa data security inc. it provide a 128-bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it be cryptographically secure because it be not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produce the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender 's private key only the md5 of the message need to be sign for authentication md5s can also be exchange directly for authentication for example ripem public key include an md5 of the public key in the file so party wish to confirm their key be authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange md5s of key and verify their accuracy md5 be sometimes use for other purpose for example it be often use to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bit of data a a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md5 be described in it entirety include an implementation in c in rfc 1321. there have be some recent suggestion that md5 may not be a strong a hash a be originally believe presumably some other hash function will be use if this be accepted a true 8 what be pem pem be privacy enhance mail a standard for allow transfer of encrypt electronic mail generate over a long period of time by a work group of expert it be described in rfcs 1421-1424 these document have be approve and obsolete the old rfcs 1113-1115. ripem be not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificate for authenticate key which ripem do not handle at this time their addition be plan 9 what 's this about distribute and authenticate key for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message receive come from her you must know her public key it be important that this information be accurate if a `` bad guy '' convinces her that his key be in fact yours she will send message which he can read ripem allows for three method of key management a central server the distribute finger server and a flat file all three be described in the ripem user guide which be part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security the pem standard call for key management by certificate the addition of this feature to ripem be plan but chicken-egg issue still exist 10 it a bad idea to use patent algorithm in standard like pem this issue have be consider in the standard process rfc 1310 the specification for internet standard have a discussion section 6 on what specification for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patent method to be include in a standard rfc 1421 address this issue with regard to the patent cover public-key cryptography this do not of course mean that all question be settle or that everyone be in agreement an interest exchange on the use of patent algorithm in standard with regard to public-key cryptography be in the league for program freedom archive available via ftp ftp.uu.net /doc/lpf in the file bidzos.letter and bidzos.response amusingly the lpf file on ftp.uu.net be compress with a patent algorithm 11 what about rsadsi/pkp rsa data security inc. rsadsi be a california-based company specialize in cryptographic technology public key partner be a firm which hold exclusive sub-licensing right of the follow u.s. patent and all of their correspond foreign patent cryptographic apparatus and method `` diffie-hellman '' ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... no 4,200,770 public key cryptographic apparatus and method `` hellman-merkle '' ... ... ... ... ... ... .. no 4,218,582 cryptographic communication system and method `` rsa '' ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. no 4,405,829 exponential cryptographic apparatus and method `` hellman-pohlig '' ... ... ... ... ... ... .. no 4,424,414 pkp claim these four patent cover all know method of public key cryptography the two business be rather closely related for example the same person jim bidzos be president of both of them pkp have license this technology to a considerable number of company ibm dec motorola at t lotus ... for use in their product pkp have also threaten and file lawsuit defend their patent ripem be originally create with no connection to rsadsi other than it use of the rsaref library and for no reason other than it author 's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography however after the ball start roll people at rsadsi get interested rsadsi decide to carry ripem on it ftp site and some people there start make their own ripem key and contribute code ripem even won the `` best application built on rsaref in 1992 '' award 12 why do all ripem public key look very similar ripem public key begin with a pkcs public-key cryptography standard identifier describe various characteristic about the key so the first bunch of character in your key may be the same a those of lot of other people 's key this do not mean your key be similar but only that they be the same class of key be generate with the same program be of the same length etc 13 what be pgp pgp be another cryptographic mail program call pretty good privacy pgp have be around longer than ripem and work somewhat differently pgp be not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp do also use rsa a few major difference between pgp and ripem pgp have more key management feature particularly for user without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus have a great probability of work with other pem software pgp make no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself ripem us rsaref a library of rsa routine from rsadsi which come with a license allow noncommercial use pgp us it own implementation of rsa pkp claim that it be a violation of it patent to `` make use or sell '' pgp in the u.s. or canada without either a license or write permission see `` disclaimer '' see `` what about rsadsi/pkp '' phil zimmermann the author of pgp stop distribute it after be threaten with legal action he believe that a licensing scheme could be arrange but it happen and there seem little prospect of it happen in the future he acknowledges in the pgp user 's guide in fact if you live in the usa and you be not a federal agency you actually run pgp on your computer because public key partner want to forbid you from run my software pgp be contraband both pgp and ripem be export-restricted and can not be sent outside the u.s. and canada without an export license however pgp already exists on many ftp site in europe and other place whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp be recommend reading to anyone interested in such issue unfortunately not distribute separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the u.s. on ftp site due to liability concern 14 what about rpem rpem stand for rabin privacy enhance mail it be similar to ripem but use a public-key cipher invent by rabin which be not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on public-key system it be write by mark riordan who later write ripem it distribution be halt when contrary to the belief of many include rabin pkp claimed that their patent be broad enough to cover the cipher employ this claim be not universally accepted but be not challenged for pragmatic reason rpem be not really use anymore it be not compatible with ripem or pgp 15 what be mime mime stand for multipurpose internet mail extension and be described in rfc 1341. you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime a faq exists on it how pem should interact with mime be not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of have a mime type application/x-ripem in order to send ripem message a mime one i hope some standard will emerge draft internet document exist on the matter 16 what be tis/pem trust information system be work on a version of privacy enhance mail for general availability last i heard it be rumor to be integrate into an exist mail user agent mh rather than a stand-alone system and in beta test i know much more than that 17 i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem ..."
b"though some may argue about the nose of the camel worth note that the government proposal be limited to scramble telephony if it be only use for that purpose and do not extend to electronic mail or file encryption then it be an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which with a few exception be limited to easy-to-break inverter note that the big issue for the fed be the continued ability to wiretap before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and file let 's focus on this one question that be not ask in the release be whether this proposal be limited to telephony or if the government intend to expand it though i share many of the concern express by some i find the proposal less threaten than many others since right now most american have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip lead and a `` goat '' can eavesdrop this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phone -- -- -- reading between the line i infer that the system be highly secure without access to the key this would meet the need of u.s. business confront by rich and powerful adversary include french and japanese security service and rich japanese company it allows the nsa to make available some of it well stuff while protect law enforcement need most legitimate u.s. corporation trust the nsa and would be delighted to have a high-security system certify by them even at the price of deposit key in escrow i see no difficulty in create a reliable escrow corporation entrust their secret to attorney every day of the week and that system have work pretty well from my point of view this be a fair start point there be concern that need to be address include the reliability of the escrow but in return we get access to high-security crypto many have suggest that de and other system may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endow there be at least a good possibility which should be checked that the propose system be not so breakable it have to be nor do it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the key pursuant to a legitimate court order thus they can protect legitimate communication against economic adversary while still be able to eavesdrop on crook pursuant to a court order -- -- -- in discuss this let 's try to avoid the nastiness personal attack and noise of some previous thread this be a substantive and technical issue and personal remark have no place in such a discussion"
b"what this be an incredible statement the nsa try to suppress public key crypto and rsa and yet they claim to encourage use of strong crypto for u citizen would you trust a black-box from the nsa versus an `` open system '' from elsewhere -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\\ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -/"

b"i wish i could agree with you ask yourself this why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that be know to be at least partially compromise key escrow in this instance why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that have not be properly evaluate i.e algorythm not publically release the answer seem obvious to me they there be other hardware out there not compromise de a an example triple de a a well one my suspicion be that the price will drop dramatically on these non clipper system if not in trouble give that the clinton administration be not entirely stupid although like to think so i can not believe that they have fail to realize this they know their initiative will fail much a cripple de be never take seriously the only way their move can work be by coercion you know little about politics if you realize that this be just a first step in the next move it make no sense otherwise the next move ban or severly cripple crypto not use the `` clipper '' system be easily justified `` why would anyone want other encryption unless they be try to subvert the government provide you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever '' how can you reconcile the administration self proclaim purpose of provide law enforcement with access to encrypt data without make the clipper system the only crypto available in the u.s ... you simply and the administration know it anyone who want to keep the govt out of their hair be it for drug deal or whatever would just buy still available non-clipper system sell our crafty clinton type short they be that stupid either ban non clipper crypto be the next answer or the administration collective i.q be about that of a potato why do you think at t jumped on so fast they know go to be big and not because well right on the face of it noone will buy the stuff that have to at t must know this too think man why the hell would they jump the gun i really wonder to wit the letter i just sent to clinton the white house office of the press secretary c/o presidential comment line fax 202 456-2461 april 17 1993 sir and/or madam i must object most strongly to the administration evolve position on encryption and cryptography i be shock at the clinton regime increase lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life it be apparent to me that those who draft the `` clipper chip proposal '' which be incidentally gain notoriety a the `` big brother proposal '' be either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed anyone knowledgeable in the nuance of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm especially one destine for standardization be the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sector the proper evaluation of an algorithm dep end on careful scrutiny by these sector and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm the assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted base on assurance from `` expert '' without full disclosure be plain ignorance in addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such a de when it be characterize by key escrow be lunacy it seem an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumer will prefer to purchase equipment not cripple by government key escrow no matter how `` tamper proof '' the key escrow might be i can not believe that even the least educate policy maker would have fail to realize these flaw i can only assume then that the drafter of the `` clipper chip proposal '' knew very well the difficulty of sell a cripple system to the private sector the only way this proposal make any sense or have any chance of succeed be in coercion even the language of the proposal make it painfully clear that the next logical step be the outlaw of other encryption device and hardware that do not uti lize the `` big brother chip '' unfortunately the public at large be not educate enough on the issue to realize what they be lose i expect the big brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the american people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty word like `` harmony '' `` right to encryption '' and `` voluntary '' it mortifies me that the phrase that seem to be use more and more often to characterize the clinton administration be `` i believe happen here '' more startle be a question a colleague of mine pose and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant `` when be the reichstag fire plan for '' most concerned signature shaen logan bernhardt i uni acs.bu.edu"
b"archive-name cryptography-faq/part06 last-modified 1993/4/15 faq for sci.crypt part 6 public-key cryptography this be the sixth of ten part of the sci.crypt faq the part be mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest we have the time to send out miss part by mail so ask note such a `` kah67 '' refer to the reference list in the last part the section of this faq be available via anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu a /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroups sci.crypt sci.answers and news.answers every 21 day content what be public-key cryptography what 's rsa be rsa secure how fast can people factor number what about other public-key cryptosystems what be public-key cryptography in a classic cryptosystem we have encryption function e_k and decryption function d_k such that d_k e_k p p for any plaintext p. in a public-key cryptosystem e_k can be easily compute from some `` public key '' x which in turn be compute from k. x be publish so that anyone can encrypt message if d_k can not be easily compute from x then only the person who generate k can decrypt message the essence of public-key cryptography publish by diffie and hellman in 1976. in a classic cryptosystem if you want your friend to be able to send secret message to you you have to make sure nobody other than them see the key k. in a public-key cryptosystem you just publish x and you have to worry about spy this be only the begin of public-key cryptography there be an extensive literature on security model for public-key cryptography application of public-key cryptography other application of the mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography and so on what 's rsa rsa be a public-key cryptosystem define by rivest shamir and adleman for full detail there be a faq available by ftp at rsa.com here 's a small example plaintexts be positive integer up to 2^ 512 key be quadruple p q e d with p a 256-bit prime number q a 258-bit prime number and d and e large number with de 1 divisible by p-1 q-1 we define e_k p p^e mod pq d_k c c^d mod pq now e_k be easily compute from the pair pq e -- -but a far a anyone know there be no easy way to compute d_k from the pair pq e so whoever generates k can publish pq e anyone can send a secret message to him he be the only one who can read the message be rsa secure nobody know an obvious attack on rsa be to factor pq into p and q. see below for comment on how fast state-of-the-art factorization algorithm run unfortunately nobody have the slightest idea how to prove that factorization -- -or any realistic problem at all for that matter -- -is inherently slow it be easy to formalize what we mean by `` rsa is/ strong '' but a hendrik w. lenstra jr. say `` exact definition appear to be necessary only when one wish to prove that algorithm with certain property do _not_ exist and theoretical computer science be notoriously lack in such negative result '' how fast can people factor number it depends on the size of the number in october 1992 arjen lenstra and dan bernstein factor 2^523 1 into prime use about three week of maspar time the maspar be a 16384-processor simd machine each processor can add about 200000 integer per second the algorithm there be call the `` number field sieve '' it be quite a bit faster for special number like 2^523 1 than for general number n but it take time only about exp o log^ 1/3 n log^ 2/3 log n in any case an old and more popular method for small number be the `` multiple polynomial quadratic sieve '' which take time exp o log^ 1/2 n log^ 1/2 log n -- -faster than the number field sieve for small n but slow for large n. the breakeven point be somewhere between 100 and 150 digit depend on the implementation factorization be a fast-moving field -- -the state of the art just a few year ago be nowhere near a good a it be now if no new method be developed then 2048-bit rsa key will always be safe from factorization but one predict the future before the number field sieve be found many people conjecture that the quadratic sieve be asymptotically a fast a any factor method could be what about other public-key cryptosystems"

b"april 16 1993 initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today make a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of million of american the first part of the plan be to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communication privacy issue such a export control which have effectively deny most people easy access to robust encryption and law enforcement issue pose by new technology however eff be very concerned that the administration have already reach a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion have be allow apparently the administration be go to use it leverage to get all telephone equipment vendor to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the national security agency the so-called `` clipper chip '' be an 80-bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chip manufacture by a military contractor two separate escrow agent would store user key and be require to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme use be to be classify but the chip will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into it communication product this proposal raise a number of serious concern first the administration have adopt a solution before conduct an inquiry the nsa-developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product other vendor or developer may have well scheme furthermore we should not rely on the government a the sole source for the clipper or any other chip rather independent chip manufacturer should be able to produce chipsets base on open standard second an algorithm can not be trust unless it can be test yet the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classify eff believe that any standard adopt ought to be public and open the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that be open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of a split-key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement need the detail of this scheme must be explore publicly before it be adopt what will give people confidence in the safety of their key do disclosure of key to a third party waive an individual 's fifth amendment right in subsequent criminal inquiry these be but a few of the many question the administration proposal raise but fails to answer in sum the administration have show great sensitivity to the importance of these issue by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security however the `` clipper chip '' solution ought to be consider a part of the inquiry and not be adopt before the discussion even begin detail of the proposal escrow the 80-bit key will be divide between two escrow agent each of whom hold 40-bits of each key the manufacturer of the communication device would be require to register all key with the two independent escrow agent a key be tie to the device however not the person use it upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agent would have to turn the key part over to law enforcement agent accord to the presidential directive just issue the attorney general will be ask to identify appropriate escrow agent some in the administration have suggest that one non-law enforcement federal agency perhaps the federal reserve and one non-governmental organization could be chosen but there be no agreement on the identity of the agent yet classify algorithm and the possibility of back door the administration claim that there be no back door -- mean by which the government or others could break the code without secure key from the escrow agent -- and that the president will be told there be no back door to this classify algorithm in order to prove this administration source be interested in arrange for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap door the result of the investigation would then be make public the clipper chipset be design and be be produce and a sole-source secret contract between the national security agency and two private firm vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on this plan have be underway for about four year the manufacturing contract be let 14 month ago government a market driver in order to get a market move and to show that the government believe in the security of this system the fed will be the first big customer for this product user will include the fbi secret service vp al gore and maybe even the president at today 's commerce department press briefing a number of people ask this question though why would any private organization or individual adopt a classify standard that have no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap door comprehensive policy inquiry the administration have also announce that it be about to commence an inquiry into all policy issue related to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement the item to be consider include export control on encryption technology and the fbi 's digital telephony proposal it appear that the this inquiry will be conduct by the national security council unfortunately however the presidential directive describe the inquiry be classify some public involvement in the process have be promise but they term have yet to be specify from more information contact jerry berman executive director jberman eff.org daniel j. weitzner senior staff counsel djw eff.org full text of the press release and fact sheet issue by the administration will be available on eff 's ftp site"

b"that worry me at all not go to cheat at something they can get caught at and key size be one of the thing that can be verify externally feed lot of random key/input pair into the chip then try flip random key bit and see what happens to the output we already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bit should vary on average from a 1-bit key change or input change if they be out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that some of the bit be much less powerful than others in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game by contrast de be design to use each key bit a early a possible the 50 output change rate appear a early a round 5. again though i think nsa be go to cheat that crudely likely to get caught remember that they 've promise to let a committee of outside expert see the cryptosystem design if you assume something des-like a bias subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb the committee can and should run lot of test and retain the output this can be verify later against the chip and yes the civilian community have at least some secure storage facility that i think even nsa can get into without it be notice until fort meade get it transporter work again oops -- i think i be suppose to talk about that ... the committee member can even retain secure copy of the code -- in two half which you have to xor together to recover the program ... seriously there be i think problem with this whole scheme but the people who invent it stupid and they 've be in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of u not go to lie in way that can be detect easily since their credibility be the *only* thing they can use to sell this system if they 've lie about the civilian committee no one will believe them about the absence of other back door if they 've lie about the key size no one will believe that they copy the program disk with the u key if they 've lie about obvious aspect of the strength of the cryptosystem no one will believe the escrow agency in cahoot with them that to say that they lie about all those other thing anyway and certainly not claim that nsa build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee find -- look how long it take for folk to believe that the s-boxes sabotage entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report for just such reason but a subtle point i.e. one you explain to a senator ... i like the unit key generation process any well than you do however -- s1 and s2 be suppose to be under control of the same escrow agent if they be trust to keep the seed value secure they be trust to keep the half-keys secure i still know if or when s1 and s2 change i thought i have see something about them be constant but i just reread denning 's technical information post and it say anything one way or the other"

b"i understand believe it or not and there be any number of kind of conversation and communication i engage in that i even consider use this scheme for on the other hand i see `` clipper '' a provide a secure channel -- it just prevents casual eavesdropping this be part of why i be not worried about it per se try to look at clipper a a serious security tool be simply ludicrous a voice scrambler nothing more there be still plenty of market for real crypto they cost an arm and a leg though `` clipper '' be obviously aim at the mass market it certainly put cylink out of business this be old news i can do this now there be restriction example a networking software vendor with a large overseas share of our market we can not currently ship pem or even simple de in our product without case-by-case approval from the department of state itar present a material trade barrier to u firm try to compete in international information system market sure you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over bb 's in the usa i on the other hand want strong crypto pkcs for example to be the *default* for electronic mail worldwide i want priest to be able to hear confession over email i want lawyer to be able to talk to client in confidence over email or doctor talk with patient i want to be able to order product from my favorite japanese mail-order catalog over the net i want to be able to sign contract transact business and so on electronically this be so far infeasible a a result of the current restriction on crytographic system especially beyond the border of the usa clipper be irrelevant and if it distracts the authority into feel safe all the well it only danger be if it emboldens them into try to put more restriction into place on the theory that it be `` good enough for anyone who have nothing to hide '' that argument be of course utter b just a much a `` no one need an assault rifle ''"
b"quite astonish shock and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerge american freedom the clinton administration nor any other government agency have any legitimate role whatsoever in regulate cryptography to do so be tantamount to regulate acceptable speech and be blatantly unconstitutional perhaps we should rename this year 1984 in honor of such an illustrious proposal let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure i be outrage that my tax money be be use to develop technology to restrict my freedom far beyond reasonable measure the u.s. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberty such a this and i call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal the administration do not seem to understand that they be merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involve in this proposal in this respect be wholly negligent and remiss in perform their lawful duty it seem to me that u.s. diplomatic communication should be tappable by the u.n. whenever any country produce a warrant to the u.n. in fact i think we should stop pay the nsa billion of dollar a year to produce unbreakable code for this reason these action violate the sovereignity of international law i hope mr. clinton be shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here but if he a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheless cryptography be neutral technology if everybody have strong cryptography include policeman bureacrats businessmen housewife thug and hoodlum we have a sustainable equilibrium anything less be an unworkable anti-egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedom and guaranteed to collapse under it own weight of inherent impracticality we need to compromise on issue of freedom for too long our government have demonstrate itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protect american it be not possible for the federal government to `` act quickly '' or develop `` consistent comprehensive policy '' period and even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing be possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive american citizen of fundamental and inalienable right the administration have to be commit to leave private industry alone esp on this issue the government have no legitimate role in regulate the content of communication law enforcement agency must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon they be soon and inevitably to be disarm of it no such law can be constitutionally sound and this be equivalent to a veil threat which i appreciate this kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism i will trade threat for threat and violation for violation if the administration do say this it would find itself impeach for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential establish entrench and explicit constitutional privacy guarantee the administration would have no legal stand whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal and wholly untolerated and disregard by vast segment of the population the u.s. comprise of a vast majority of people fanatically commit to preserve their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government be say just that take your chip and give them to nsa employee a christmas bonus we can run any algorithm on our computer we damn well please and we will make any chip we please and we will send any bit pattern over our data highway we please and if you try to stop u you will be gradually or abruptly dissolve into nothingness privacy vs. law enforcement this be an outright dingaling denning lie the two aim of privacy and surveillance be intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise american be about to discover way through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedom that have slowly be erode away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and *unrepresentative* government --"

b"from the limited detail release so far it seem that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography otherwise the key management problem inherent to symetric cipher would make the system unworkable it probably have some sort of public key exchange that take place at the start of each call thats how they would identify the private key in their data base this mean that either the nsa have developed some non rsa public key algorythm or the fed have decide to subsidize pkp rsadsi the former be rather an excite posibility since keep the algorythm secret while make chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard if the fed be force to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break rsa 's stranglehold on public key crypto in the u.s. a for my impression of the whole scheme it seem that instead of try to ban strong crypto they be try to co-opt it their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm more likely be that they dont want anyone construct black market device which dont have the key register anyone else notice that in their q a session they talk about release the key only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around state that the key will simply have to be supeonaed they seem to be try to keep open the posibility of obtain key without court order even though tap a phone line require one also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept this or ban strong crypto outright i dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all legal way possible"

b"i doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leader understandable -- most corporate exec know much about cryptology and easy to get take in by someone peddle snake oil and the propose scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now the problem be that with any security scheme of this kind you have to concern yourself with the weak link in the chain i suspect that nsa have put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs probably at least a strong a say de in ofb-mode unfortunately the existence of the key-registry system seem to make possible all kind of possible attack at a small fraction of the expense of try to build say a de keysearch machine a originally described it sound like any police court combination could acquire the key for a give chip i hope not the case since it would imply a glare hole how much do it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organize crime bos however even if more intelligent scheme be use to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversation there will be weak- ness they may be very expensive and very difficult but who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that for say 100,000 could by crack one time in a hundred de for all the complaint about a 56-bit key would probably cost several million dollar to build a keysearch machine for how many million dollar would the confidential phone message of the gm headquarters be worth to nissan chrysler or audi how about home phone of major exec and important engineer and designer `` gee mr jones i understand have some financial problem lately maybe i can help ...

b"attempt to write a serious policy paper examine whether the propose wiretap or `` clipper '' chip be a cost-effective tool for police investigation that be ignore concern about government intrusion into individual privacy be the value of easy wiretap to investigator great than the cost to the communication industry and their customer to support this wiretap technology a rough estimate suggests that wiretap be worth about five million dollar per year to u.s. law enforcement agency in 1990 872 u.s. wiretap lead to 2057 arrest while total police expenditure of 28 billion lead to 11.25 million arrest ref u statistical abstract work on estimate this wiretap benefit more accurately but like to ask hardware expert out there to help me with estimate the cost of the new propose wiretap technology please send me quotable/citeable estimate for how many chip which would need to be make per year to keep all phone with wiretap chip how much would it cost to make each chip how much do it cost to develop this technology in the first place how much more would support hardware people etc cost per chip what percentage cheaper would encryption chip and support have be if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption need what percentage of phone traffic would be take up by the propose `` law enforcement block '' what be the total cost of handle all phone traffic per year put another way the question ask be what if each police agency that want a particular wiretap have to pay for it be charge their share of the full social cost of force communication to be wiretap compatible would they choose to buy such wiretap or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crime in other way"

b"hmmm this give me an interest idea how about this argument 1 second amendment give u the right to keep and bear arm 2 strong cryptography be `` arm '' accord to the u.s. government why so hard to export therefore we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography q.e.d however likely to be a hard or harder to exercise this right a it be get to exercise the other right that the government be slowly restrict maybe the nra _would_ be the best exist organization although i think a new one might be well but perhaps would take too long to start up i would certainly join"

-- the white house office of the press secretary _________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 16 1993 statement by the press secretary the president today announce a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communication while meeting the legitimate need of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new product to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunication network and wireless communication link for too long there have be little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenge of protect american rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes compete interest of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policy have pit government against industry and the right of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology have be use for year to protect electronic fund transfer it be now be use to protect electronic mail and computer file while encryption technology can help american protect business secret and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be use by terrorist drug dealer and other criminal a state-of-the-art microcircuit call the `` clipper chip '' have be developed by government engineer the chip represent a new approach to encryption technology it can be use in new relatively inexpensive encryption device that can be attach to an ordinary telephone it scramble telephone communication use an encryption algorithm that be more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help company protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversation and prevent unauthorized release of data transmit electronically at the same time this technology preserve the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agency to intercept lawfully the phone conversation of criminal a `` key-escrow '' system will be establish to ensure that the `` clipper chip '' be use to protect the privacy of law-abiding american each device contain the chip will have two unique 2 `` key '' number that will be need by authorize government agency to decode message encode by the device when the device be manufacture the two key will be deposit separately in two `` key-escrow '' data base that will be establish by the attorney general access to these key will be limited to government official with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new device in addition respect expert from outside the government will be offer access to the confidential detail of the algorithm to ass it capability and publicly report their finding the chip be an important step in address the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption help to protect the privacy of individual and industry but it also can shield criminal and terrorist we need the `` clipper chip '' and other approach that can both provide law-abiding citizen with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminal from use it to hide their illegal activity in order to ass technology trend and explore new approach like the key-escrow system the president have direct government agency to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates -- the privacy of our citizen include the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purpose -- the ability of authorize official to access telephone call and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizen -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure need to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and -- the need of u.s. company to manufacture and export high technology product the president have direct early and frequent consultation with affected industry the congress and group that advocate the privacy right of individual a policy option be developed 3 the administration be commit to work with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunication and computer technology to give american unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high-speed network `` information superhighway '' will transmit video image hdtv program and huge data file a easily a today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy regard it use the administration be commit to policy that protect all american right to privacy while also protect them from those who break the law far information be provide in an accompany fact sheet the provision of the president 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology be also available for additional detail call mat heyman national institute of standard and technology 301 975-2758 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- question and answer about the clinton administration's telecommunication initiative q do this approach expand the authority of government agency to listen in on phone conversation a no `` clipper chip '' technology provide law enforcement with no new authority to access the content of the private conversation of american q suppose a law enforcement agency be conduct a wiretap on a drug smuggle ring and intercept a conversation encrypt use the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entity responsible for safeguard the key and obtain the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two part which be store separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow data bank a the two key-escrow data bank will be run by two independent entity at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agency will oversee the key-escrow data bank q how strong be the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security be a this system be more secure than many other voice encryption system readily available today while the algorithm will remain classify to protect the security of the key escrow system we be willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography expert to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential user that there be no unrecognized vulnerability q whose decision be it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agency be involve in this decision this approach have be endorse by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet official q who be consult the congress industry a we have on-going discussion with congress and industry on encryption issue and expect those discussion to intensify a we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed member of congress and industry leader on the decision related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturer a the government design and developed the key access encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product manufacturer product manufacturer can acquire the microcircuit from the chip manufacturer that produce them q who provide the `` clipper chip '' a mykotronx program it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturer the program function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device a we expect several manufacturer to consider incorporate the `` clipper chip '' into their device q if the administration be unable to find a technological solution like the one propose would the administration be willing to use legal remedy to restrict access to more powerful encryption device a this be a fundamental policy question which will be consider during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide american with an encryption product that be more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it be just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration be develop the administration be not say `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright '' a some country have effectively do nor be the u.s. say that `` every american a a matter of right be entitle to an unbreakable commercial encryption product '' there be a false `` tension '' create in the assessment that this issue be an `` either-or '' proposition rather both concern can be and in fact be harmoniously balance through a reason balance approach such a be propose with the `` clipper chip '' and similar encryption technique q what do this decision indicate about how the clinton administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunication and compute and be commit to work with industry and public-interest group to find innovative way to protect americans' privacy help business to compete and ensure that law enforcement agency have the tool they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the device be exportable will other device that use the government hardware"

b"the law be much bad than worthless it give police the power to put innocent people in jail because they the police find something they understand most police know what the return key do never mind the difference between a core file and classify military secret there be plenty of scenario where the user would have no idea what something be either it could be uninitialized junk the burden of proof be on the user to show that something a normal upstanding citizen should have no one should ever be put in that situation especially in america what 's disgust about this be how easily most people go along with it to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer or whatever bad thing be in style at the time basically most people have a clear distinction between criminal and suspect a an analogy like they find a loose screw in your house and they insist that building a bomb or machine gun they ask you where it come from like know and ask you to prove your claim when you explain it in such simple term people may start to get the idea a a matter of fact i do keep random file on my disk the reason be without special-purpose hardware it take a long time to generate good random bit i have program that crank out a couple bit per minute which be pretty conservative but over time more than i need if you think about it there 's no point in actually encrypt random data because it just give you different random data if you want some data to look like an encrypt file you just put an appropriate header on it if enough people do this some of them will be put in jail when you get arrest and the police ask for your key you can tell them just random junk although of course they believe you while sit in jail you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few cpu-years try to find something not there"
b'it already do'
b"the point raise about check what be actually -in- the chip a oppose to what be allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust issue even if we assume that these `` trust agent '' be really enter a wide range of s1 and s2 seed rather than use the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bit i assume they be not do so by pick up an iron filing and poke it into the circuitry at carefully select point to encode data they would presumably be punch number into a computer which for all they know could program the chip in a manner completely independent of the s1 and s2 value they be feed into the system s1 and s2 be clearly the backdoor we should assume they be all compromise if not compromisable why the hell not use a hardware true random number source there a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal the whole thing be deterministic from the day the serial number be stamp on the chip nope it be trust this be all about two level of access the possibly honest key escrow that police force have to use and ostensibly the fbi and the back door that let the nsa decode *everything* on the fly and maybe some back-handers to the fbi when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favour"
b"indeed if nsa really design the algorithm to be secure very likely a secure a idea or 2-key de however the system a a whole resistant to `` practical cryptanalysis '' in _the puzzle palace_ bamford describes how several nsa employee be turn by foreign presumably kgb agent despite security measure that i doubt any big 8 accounting firm could match and nsa confidential data be *not* subject to be request by thousand of police organization and court across the land ah yes anyone mention ronald william pelton heh heh heh how embarrass"

b"i think your experience under the bulgarian regime be highly relevant we have too many people with their head in the sand say it can not happen here a our constitutional right be be trash every day because the government justifies do some end-run around the protection by a 'crisis require 'drastic action it be most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tool will be regard a possession of 'terrorist and drug dealer tool and be some serious fedaral felony just like common tool be 'burgular tool if the police say so common computer program even computer themselves be now 'hackers tool and will become 'terrorist tool bet on it the insight of someone who have live throught this be very important if the u go the way of the old soviet union and it client state a far a individual right privacy and overall freedom be concerned the rest of the world remember 'new world order will not be far behind only a few year please keep post anything you find that be deficient or that threatens one right in this thing for example a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from big brother eavesdropping political dissent allready be very dangerous in this country all it take be the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal mean the phrase 'illegal mean be define a whatever the government want it to be define a couple this with clinton 's press for a 'smart national id card an 'internal passport with the add wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it and you can only take the government's word a to what be really on it since they will be the only one with the mean to completely read and reprogram the thing that nice while the fed can bust into one 's safe without the key the owner know his safe have be broken into when they break into your 'secure' phone conversation or other stored/transmitted data in the near future you have no way of know so accountability a to the legality have go out the window just like a safe if they have a legal cause they can get the key from the suspect just like they can get the key to a safe or the combination from the suspect same with encryption record everything get the warrant then decode it with the key obtain from the suspect this clinton cripple along with it natural extension will make any priviliged communication between client and lawyer and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible which be the general idea any propeganda about it be secure and the safeguard and all of that be just that propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity do n't be suckered big brother be listen"

b'the only way to view this method of generate unit key be a a back-door what else can you call a key deterministically generate from the serial number to generate the unit key for a serial number n the 30-bit value n be first pad with a fix 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block n1 s1 and s2 be then use a key to triple-encrypt n1 produce a 64-bit block r1 r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 similarly n be pad with two other 34-bit block to produce n2 and n3 and two additional 64-bit block r2 and r3 be compute r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1 r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1 r1 r2 and r3 be then concatenate together give 192 bit the first 80 bit be assign to u1 and the second 80 bit to u2 the rest be discard the unit key u be the xor of u1 and u2 u1 and u2 be the key part that be separately escrowed with the two escrow agency'
b"now why would anyone `` post '' anything encrypt encryption be only of use between person who know how to decrypt the data and why should i care what other people look at what do concern me be the continued erosion of my constitutional right amendment i ii iv and v to note a few"
b"no thanks this topic be of interest to a much wider audience `` in make this decision i intend to prevent the private sector from develop except with the government 's approval other microcircuit or algorithm that be more effective in assure privacy ''"
b"here be some correction and addition to hellman 's note courtesy of dorothy denning again this be reposted with permission two request -- first note the role of s1 and s2 it appear to me and others that anyone who know those value can construct the unit key and the nature of the generation process for k1 and k2 be such that neither can be produce alone thus the scheme can not be implement such that one repository generates the first half-key and another generates the second *that* be ominous second -- these posting be not reveal scripture nor be they carefully-crafted spook posting attempt to draw out hidden meaning a oppose to say the official announcement of clipper leave denning out of this give hellman 's record of opposition to de which go back before some folk on this newsgroup knew how to read i think you can impugn his integrity oh yeah -- the folk who invent clipper stupid if you think something make sense almost certainly because you understand their goal -- steve bellovin -- -- date sun 18 apr 93 07:56:39 edt from denning cs.georgetown.edu dorothy denning subject re clipper chip to a long list of folk i be also briefed by the nsa and fbi so let me add a few comment to marty 's message the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embed in the algorithm operates on 64-bit block like de and the chip support all 4 de mode of operation the algorithm us 32 round of scramble compare with 16 in de in addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it a often a desire call this key plain old k. when a message be to be sent it will first be k be the session key share by the sender and receiver any method e.g. public key can be use to establish the session key in the at t telephone security device which will have the new chip the key be negotiate use a public-key protocol encrypt under k then k will be encrypt under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit add to produce a three part message which will then be encrypt under the system key sk produce e e m k e k uk serial number sk my understand be that e m k be not encrypt under sk call the '' family key '' and that the decrypt key correspond to sk be held by law enforcement do anyone have first hand knowledge on this i will also check it out but this be 7am sunday so i do not want to wait the unit key will be generate a the xor of two 80-bit random number k1 and k2 uk=k1+k2 which will be kept by the two escrow the unit key also call the `` chip key '' be generate from the serial number n a follow let n1 n2 and n3 be 64 bit block derive from n and let s1 and s2 be two 80-bit seed use a key compute the 64-bit block r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1 note that this be like use the de in triple encryption mode with two key similarly compute block r2 and r3 start with n2 and n3 unlear about whether the key s1 and s2 change the fact that call seed suggests they might then r1 r2 and r3 be concatenate together give 192 bit the first 80 bit form k1 and the next 80 bit form k2 the remain bit be discard authority who these escrow authority will be be still to be decide by the attorney general but it be stress to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agency that they must be party acceptable to the user of the system a unbiased marty be right on this and the fbi have ask me for suggestion please pas them to me along with your reason in addition to marty's criterion i would add that the agency must have an establish record of be able to safeguard highly sensitive information some suggestion receive so far include sri rand mitre the national lab sandia lanl los alamo treasury gao when a court order obtains k1 and k2 and thence k the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flow on the suspect link aside it be my guess that they may do this constantly on all link with or without a court order since it be almost impossible to tell which link over which a message will flow my understand be that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operate by the fbi the service provider will isolate the communication stream and pas it to the fbi where it will pas through the decode box which will have be keyed with k. for `` the wiretap authorization '' when levy ask for the detail so he could review the case a require by law the agent told him that his predecessor just turn over 40-50 blank sign form every time levi do not comply and change the system but the lesson be clear no single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretap no single person do at least for fbi tap after complete a mound of paperwork an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain that include fbi legal counsel before the request be even take to the attorney general for final approval"
b"-- -- -begin pgp sign message -- -- i find this a very disturb view yes we do care about everyone's privacy ... even if `` they '' know it what happens if the gov't start create legislation such that the clipper and such technology become the only `` legal '' encryption form what happens when the clipper be the *only* type of encryption chip available to the mass sure you might have your own method of encryption but if you have anyone else to talk to what use be it you assume that everyone will be a open a you appear to be about encryption the point here be not the specific instance of the wiretap chip rather it be like have the government tell you that they want a copy of your house key safe-deposit box key etc. and tell you that `` they wont use them unless it totally neccessary '' i sure want that why should encryption be any different -derek pgp 2 key available upon request on the key-server pgp-public-keys toxicwaste.mit.edu -- -- -begin pgp signature -- -- version 2.2 iqbuagubk9rxvjh0k1zbsgrxaqhd8aledi3ear7remr1uhuxqv2yiblh6px6vxnb +sjlcugzzxtcfxbrqif7mslp98p0evyynlzbboryvhfszyyhyheqqqilhek3lpqe ap29+od6yzrccharnrs024e= =ftek -- -- -end pgp signature -- --"

b"note i be *not* a cable freak so i might have completely misunderstood what you say also my math be frequently note for be wrong so well check the calculation yourself i assume that 14.4k mean 14.4k bit so if we assume one start and one stopbit and no protocol overhead the effective number of byte per second be 1.44k let 's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in stereo so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec this corresponds to a nyquist frequency of 720 hz which should be too low especially if you think about the 8-bit low quality sound furthermore your d/a converter will probably not present you with a signal that have be cut off at 720 hz but will instead alias in all the high frequency although you can definitely build a filter to overcome that problem on the other hand speech should be easily compressible for example you could form power spectrum or you could simply band-pass filter and then linearize the fourier transforms it be cd quality sound but it 'll be discernible the power spectrum method be very good in that respect i have once programmed such a software compressor and compression rate of 90 with relative error due to linearization of less than 5 be common although i must say that these be musical sound not speech have fun"
b"i totally agree but how do you propose we take government back they obviously listen to the people or want the people to know who be responsibile for what a person telnetted the site of the clipper chip release to see what the entity 'clipper be and get a few list but when another person try a bit later the command be disabled do not sound like an administration that want to have any accountability or information they control give to the people the secret development and implimentation of the clipper chip decision far back that up you can bet unaurhorized encryption method and software will be consider 'terrorist tool and also subject to civil forfeiture along with the system that be run it you watch see if i be wrong the government be not go to be very cooperative about the people take it back and they have all the resource unlimited access to the medium for propeganda and almost all the gun soon to be all the gun if clinton 's agenda succeed ... those that do not play ball waco might be a good example of what to expect ... the warrant just release state the reason for the raid be the bd spent a very large sum for weapon over an undetermined amount of time i recall spending a lot of money on gun etc be illegal ... yet that be clinton might go down in history a the bad thing to ever happen to the u of a ... now to be know a the 'peoples socalist democratic republic of america psdra big brother be listen hail big brother ... and sister ... only ten year late"
b'in light of my recent paranoia concern government proposal love to see a unix-based encryption scheme that 1 kept some file encrypt on the host machine say all the file in your home directory 2 use a key system that could not be compromise by eavesdropping over a modem line it seem that this would require modification to a shell program and a way of tell whether a file be encrypt or not among other thing love to know about potential security hole in such a system do such a system exist if it be make easy-to-use and readily available i think it would be a good thing tm i realize that this would probably just involve put a nice front-end on a readily available and very secure encryption scheme but it should be do'
b"there be an interest column on the editorial page of the dallas morning news on saturday by walter williams who i believe be a professor at georgetown i wonder if he know of dorothy `` not in kansa anymore '' denning the article be title `` government slowly erode our liberty '' and in it he tell a story attribute to the late leonard read who explain that if you want to take liberty away from american you have to know how to cook a frog mr. read say you cook a frog by boil a pot of water and then throw the frog in his reflex be so quick that a soon a his foot touch the water he will leap away you must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it up bit by bit by the time the frog realizes be cooked it be too late it be the same with american if anyone try to take our freedom all at once we would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant but a with successful frog cooking our liberty can be take a little bit at a time the last line of the article say `` not too late for u but the water be get pretty warm '' have toagree that warm and the clipper be keep the temperature on an upward course note followup redirect to alt.privacy.clipper"

and ask for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt file that have a 10 char or less pw key '' how do i break a vigenere repeated-key cipher a repeated-key cipher where the ciphertext be something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on be call a vigenere cipher if the key be not too long and the plaintext be in english do the follow 1. discover the length of the key by counting coincidence see gaines gai44 sinkov sin66 try each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those byte which be equal if the two ciphertext portion have use the same key something over 6 of the byte will be equal if they have use different key then less than 0.4 will be equal assume random 8-bit byte of key cover normal ascii text the small displacement which indicates an equal key be the length of the repeat key 2. shift the text by that length and xor it with itself this remove the key and leaf you with text xored with itself since english have about 1 bit of real information per byte 2 stream of text xored together have 2 bit of info per 8-bit byte provide plenty of redundancy for choose a unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself have just 1 bit per byte if the key be short it might be even easy to treat this a a standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis text show how to break those possible with those method in the hand of an expert if there 's only ten time a much text a key see for example gaines gai44 sinkov sin66 how do i send encrypt mail under unix pgp ripem pem ... here 's one popular method use the de command cat file compress de private_key uuencode mail meanwhile there be a de jure internet standard in the work call pem privacy enhance mail it be described in rfcs 1421 through 1424. to join the pem mail

available by ftp each have it own newsgroup alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem each have it own faq a well pgp be most commonly use outside the usa since it us the rsa algorithm without a license and rsa 's patent be valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem be most commonly use inside the usa since it us the rsaref which be freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both program use a secret key algorithm for encrypt the body of the message pgp use idea ripem us de and rsa for encrypt the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have be repeat call for each to understand the other 's format and algorithm choice no interoperation be available at this time a far a we know be the unix crypt command secure no see ree84 there be a program available call cbw crypt breaker 's workbench which can be use to do ciphertext-only attack on file encrypt with crypt one source for cbw be ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption a number of people have propose do perfect compression follow by some simple encryption method e.g. xor with a repeat key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible input for all practical purpose impossible to describe `` the typical english text '' beyond coarse characteristic such a single-letter frequency you can build up more and more sophisticated model of your input but if the enemy have a slightly more accurate model be able to find some redundancy in your compress output note that nearly all practical compression scheme unless they have be design with cryptography in mind produce output that actually start off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begin with a well-known three-byte `` magic number '' that can serve a an enter wedge for cryptanalysis this be not to say that compression before encryption be inherently a bad idea it just have to be do very very carefully and by no mean remove the need for strong encryption compression after encryption be silly be there an unbreakable cipher yes the one-time pad be unbreakable see part 4. unfortunately the one-time pad require secure distribution of a much key material a plaintext of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it need to be strong enough to resist attack by likely enemy for whatever length of time the data it protects be expect to remain valid what do `` random '' mean in cryptography cryptographic application demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most application for a source of bit to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be give complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generate the stream and the sequence of 0th through n-1st bit for all n up to the lifetime of the source a software generator also know a pseudo-random have the function of expand a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bit this seed must be large enough not to be guess by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generate by a hardware random number source those who have sparcstation 1 workstation could for example generate random number use the audio input device a a source of entropy by not connect anything to it for example cat /dev/audio compress foo give a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file use part of itself a a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random string when look for hardware device to provide this entropy it be important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it look complicate to a human it must be `` random '' for example disk operation completion time sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but a spin disk be much like a clock and it output completion time be relatively low in entropy what be the unicity point a.k.a unicity distance see sha49 the unicity distance be an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the correspond source text and encryption key equal the number of ciphertext bit use ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be show probably to have a unique decipherment this be use to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter than this be likely to have multiple equally valid decryption and therefore to gain security from the opponent 's difficulty choose the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information-theoretic measure do not make deterministic prediction but rather give probabilistic result namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it be likely that there be only a single intelligible plaintext correspond to the ciphertext when all possible key be try for the decryption work cryptologist normally deal with unicity distance a such instead they directly determine the likelihood of event of interest let the unicity distance of a cipher be d character if few than d ciphertext character have be intercept then there be not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible key de have a unicity distance of 17.5 character which be less than 3 ciphertext block each block corresponds to 8 ascii character this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance give no indication of the computational work require to find the key after approximately d character have be intercept in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the line use in discuss unicity distance like other measure such a key size unicity distance be something that guarantee insecurity if too small but guarantee security if high few practical cryptosystems be absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristic might serve a enter `` wedge '' to crack some cipher message however similar information-theoretic consideration be occasionally useful for example to determine a recommend key change interval for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalyst also employ a variety of statistical and information-theoretic test to help guide the analysis in the most promising direction unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistic to cryptanalysis remains classify even the seminal 1940 work of alan turing see koz84 for some insight into the possibility see kul68 and goo83 what be key management and why be it important one of the fundamental axiom of cryptography be that the enemy be in full possession of the detail of the general cryptographic system and lack only the specific key data employ in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia do not make a habit of tell mossad about it cryptosystems but mossad probably find out anyway repeat use of a finite amount of key provide redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication system where vast amount of information be transfer both party must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refers to the distribution authentication and handle of key a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology be the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classify use employ individual cod `` crypto ignition key '' and a central key management center operate by nsa there be a hierarchy in that certain ciks be use by authorize cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic key and to perform installation/maintenance function such a the reporting of lose ciks this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public-key system there be several related issue many have to do with `` whom do you trust '' can i use pseudo-random or chaotic number a a key stream chaotic equation and fractal produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generator perhaps the simplest example be a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular type of random number generator where there be no obvious dependence between seed and output unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up a a regular lattice mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which be notoriously easy for cryptanalyst to exploit more complicate generator have more complicate structure which be why they make interest picture -- but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see knu81 exercise 3.5-7 ree77 and boy89 what be the correct frequency list for english letter there be three answer to this question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in various book namely a frequency list compute directly from a certain sample of english text of course any such list will be `` correctly '' compute but exactly which list you get depends on which sample be take the second answer be that the question make sense what do you mean by `` english letter '' the `` english language '' be not a fix finite close object that can be exactly characterize it have change over time it be different between different author any particular message will have different statistic from those of the language a a whole the third answer be that yes no particular message be go to have exactly the same characteristic a english in general but for all reasonable statistical us these slight discrepancy matter in fact there 's an entire field call `` bayesian statistic '' other buzzword be `` maximum entropy method '' and `` maximum likelihood estimation '' which study question like `` what 's the chance that a text with these letter frequency be in english '' and come up with reasonably robust answer so make your own list from your own sample of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what be the enigma `` for a project in data security we be look for source of information about the german enigma code and how it be broken by the british during wwii '' see wel82 dea85 koz84 hod83 kah91 how do i shuffle card card shuffle be a special case of the permutation of an array of value use a random or pseudo-random function all possible output permutation of this process should be equally likely to do this you need a random function modran x which will produce a uniformly distribute random integer in the interval 0..x-1 give that function you can shuffle with the follow c code assume arrlth be the length of array arr and swap interchange value at the two address give for n arrlth-1 n 0 n -- swap arr modran n+1 arr n modran x can not be achieve exactly with a simple ranno x since ranno 's interval may not be divisible by x although in most case the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno 's modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno return a value less than y go back and get another ranno value can i foil s/w pirate by encrypt my cd-rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish a cd-rom with possibly multiple piece of software perhaps with each encrypt separately and will want to use different key for each user perhaps even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy a far a we know this be impossible since there be nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard if there be such an identification then the cd-rom could be encrypt with a key base in part on the one sell to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd-rom be one of a kind and that defeat the intend purpose if the cd-rom be to be encrypt once and then mass produce there must be a key or set of key for that encryption produce at some stage in the process that key be useable with any copy of the cd-rom 's data the pirate need only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple cipher

b"but what about second source for pin-compatible non-clipper algorithm chip that also have escrowed key if a `` reputable firm '' produce a chip with escrowed key that be a pop-in replacement for the clipper chip in my phone and us an algorithm that be widely know and evaluate and `` trust '' then what 's the problem the clipper be go to be reverse engineer anyway by any organization with sufficient resource can you say `` billion of cocaine dollar '' so those drug dealer so worried about will be slip through the crack we law-abiding non-incredibly-wealthy citizen naturally will not have this recourse but claim that the algorithm be release to prevent people from use non-key-escrowed chip be plain deceitful ... analysis of the chip output will provide information on the necessary header and whatnot so the `` bad guy '' could build chip use a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their key or they could just buy bunch of cheap phone at k-mart every week and play swap-the-clipper-chip with their cellular phone every day"
b"just to make sure everyone be clear on this `` it never have '' refers to '' protects '' not `` fails to protect '' i.e. in my lifetime i have never see the u.s. government consistently protect the interest of u.s. citizen except by accident"
b'or just dig a deep enough hole in the ground 50 foot should do it'
b"read it again yourself then re-apply the admonition you give to the previous poster to yourself a well the first clause be not a condition it be a reason for explicitly support the right which exists militia or not that the people have a right to keep and bear arm this be not a right grant by the constitution it be a right presume to exist by default the constitution mention a right be to prevent the government from remove that right by state very clearly the government shall not infringe mess with block limit that right remember the constitution be a bunch of negative thing thing the government can not do all right etc not epxressly give to the government go to the state and the people the same people the other 9 amendment in the bill of right talk about since i be sure you will summarily reject my interpretation i be append a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself and you i suspect i be sure you will find his qualification adequate if that enough i can send you the senate subcommitee to the judiciary on the constitution report on the same thing ... there be some thing in there that big brother type like biden etc must have really have to swallow hard to admit i think you will find that people that seriously study the constitution and state what it mean will say the same thing those who come up with 'new improve meaning be those who be try to subvert the constitution for a give agenda like clinton and his clinton cripple gun control people control and control control and the whole nasty mess please tell u how this person be in error you and please back it up with some proof since i be backing my assertion up with independent proof and have a bunch more i can provide ... note followup set to talk.politics.guns -- -- -- -- begin include article -- -- -- the unabridged second amendment by j. neil schulman if you want to know all about the big bang ring up carl sagan right and if you want to know about desert warfare the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf no question about it but who would you call if you want the top expert on american usage to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united state constitution that be the question i ask a.c. brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publisher -- who himself have be recommend to me a the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr. brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud a retire professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of '' american usage and style the consensus '' a little research lent support to brocki 's opinion of professor copperud's expertise roy copperud be a newspaper writer on major daily for over three decade before embark on a a distinguish 17-year career teach journalism at usc since 1952 copperud have be write a column deal with the professional aspect of journalism for `` editor and publisher '' a weekly magazine focus on the journalism field on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster 's usage dictionary frequently cite him a an expert copperud's fifth book on usage `` american usage and style the consensus '' have be in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since 1981 and be the winner of the association of american publisher 's humanity award that sound like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduce myself but do not give him any indication of why i be interested i sent the follow letter '' i be write you to ask you for your professional opinion a an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united state constitution and extract the intent from the text `` the text of the second amendment be a well-regulated militia be necessary for the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe `` the debate over this amendment have be whether the first part of the sentence a well-regulated militia be necessary to the security of a free state be a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause contain the subject of the sentence 'the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe `` i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issue of political impact or public policy but be restrict entirely to a linguistic analysis of it meaning and intent far since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regard the consequence of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary '' my letter frame several question about the test of the second amendment then conclude '' i realize that i be ask you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter i be do so because a a citizen i believe it be vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of it result i ask that you do this because of that importance '' after several more letter and phone call in which we discuss term for his do such an analysis but in which we never discuss either of our opinion regard the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have insert my question for the sake of clarity copperud `` the word a well-regulated militia be necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cite in your letter of july 26 1991 constitutes a present participle rather than a clause it be use a an adjective modify 'militia which be follow by the main clause of the sentence subject 'the right verb 'shall the to keep and bear arm be assert a an essential for maintain a militia `` in reply to your numbered question schulman `` 1 can the sentence be interpret to grant the right to keep and bear arm solely to a well-regulated militia '' copperud `` 1 the sentence do not restrict the right to keep and bear arm nor do it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people it simply make a positive statement with respect to a right of the people '' schulman `` 2 be 'the right of the people to keep and bear arm grant by the word of the second amendment or do the second amendment assume a preexist right of the people to keep and bear arm and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringe '' copperud `` 2 the right be not grant by the amendment it existence be assume the thrust of the sentence be that the right shall be preserve inviolate for the sake of ensure a militia '' schulman `` 3 be the right of the people to keep and bear arm condition upon whether or not a well regulate militia be in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition be not exist be the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe null and void '' copperud `` 3 no such condition be express or imply the right to keep and bear arm be not say by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia no condition be state or imply a to the relation of the right to keep and bear arm and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia a a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arm be deem unconditional by the entire sentence '' schulman `` 4 do the clause a well-regulated militia be necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place condition on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arm or be such right deem unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence '' copperud `` 4 the right be assume to exist and to be unconditional a previously state it be invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia '' schulman `` 5 which of the follow do the phrase 'well-regulated militia mean 'well-equipped 'well-organized 'well-drilled 'well-educated or 'subject to regulation of a superior authority '' copperud `` 5 the phrase mean 'subject to regulation of a superior authority this accord with the desire of the writer for civilian control over the military '' schulman `` 6 if at all possible i would ask you to take account the change meaning of word or usage since that sentence be write 200 year ago but not take into account historical interpretation of the intent of the author unless those issue can be clearly separate '' copperud `` to the best of my knowledge there have be no change in the meaning of word or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it be write today it might be put `` since a well-regulated militia be necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be abridge schulman `` a a 'scientific control on this analysis i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the follow sentence '' a well-schooled electorate be necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and read book shall not be infringe `` my question for the usage analysis of this sentence would be '' 1 be the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the word modify each other identical to the second amendment 's sentence and '' 2 could this sentence be interpret to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read book _only_ to a well-educated electorate -- for example register voter with a high-school diploma '' copperud `` 1 your 'scientific control sentence precisely parallel the amendment in grammatical structure `` 2 there be nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restrict interpretation '' professor copperud have only one additional comment which he place in his cover letter `` with well-known human curiosity i make some speculative effort to decide how the material might be use but be unable to reach any conclusion '' so now we have be told by one of the top expert on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united state unconditionally protects the people 's right to keep and bear arm forbid all government form under the constitution from abridge that right a i write this the attempt coup against constitutional government in the soviet union have fail apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny be strong than the old guard 's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united state elect lawmaker judge and appoint official who be pledge to defend the constitution of the united state ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizen be put in american prison for carry arm own arm of forbidden sort or fail to satisfy bureaucratic requirement regard the own and carry of firearm -- all of which be an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arm guaranteed by the constitution and even the american civil liberty union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of right stand by and do nothing it seem it be up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arm to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elect representative not to take away our right and continue regard them a represent u if they do will we continue obey judge who decide that the second amendment mean what it say it mean but mean whatever they say it mean in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arm of our choice a the constitution of the united state promise u we can and pledge that we will defend that promise with our life our fortuned and our sacred honor c 1991 by the new gun week and

b"and since the u constitution guarantee the right to every american to bear arm why be not every american entitle a a matter of +have you read the applicable part of the constitution and interpret it in +context if not please do so before post this misinterpretation again +it refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individual +to carry handgun grenade and assault rifle hmmm this could become a flame war very quickly the text be `` ... well regulate militia ...

b"clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption but if you be make custom equipment in any case why not just roll your own clipper implementation and report the wrong key to the escrow agency tell u who be go to be in the chip business if this thing go through -- nsa and those with something to hide from nsa if anyone can verify that your phone be not use the key register to that serial number either 1 they have a court order wiretap but what be they go to do tell the judge that this individual really do have privacy all they know be that the key be not enough but not why 2 they have a court order wiretap on a phone in this series this part be really scary since the `` expectation '' be that all chip in a particular batch will us seed base on the same s1 and s2 and the serial number get the key for one of a batch may give access to all 3 there be a backdoor which allows all message to be decipher without the key i find this one especially threaten since the scheme seem very open to know plaintext attack what i need to decipher be the data in the header if i talk to someone who have one of these phone presumably there will be an automatically negotiate key generate not try to decipher the record of the conversation to know what be say i use it a a know plaintext to recover the backdoor represent by the header but i know what the header say for conversation i participate in even bad if the phone in a series have related key i can buy a phone/chip from the same production lot then i can recover it key either elegantly by talk to myself or by brute force analysis of the actual chip then apply the key generation process with those seed to find the target key hmmm i think i want to ever come close to these phone even de be start to look good two can and a string will provide much well security -- robert i. eachus"

b"i hope there be something i understand about this system but can someone tell me how these chip be go to be manufacture while maintain each half key under total control of the separate escrow agency both half of the key have to come together in some form at the time the chip be construct or be it built like a fusable prom with the chip be sent to the 1st escrow agency to program it 1/2 key then the 2nd agency to program it 1/2 key but who invents the safeguard that prevent the 2nd agency from reading the information already programmed by the 1st this intend to be a flame or anything i be just really curious how to manufacture these thing while still maintain the key escrow security without simply say `` trust the manufacturer they look ''"
b"no kid the most recent post i saw in alt.privacy.clipper and i hope anyone interested in this topic end up there state that clipper have be in development for over four year i be however more than a little po 'd that clinton put his name on this monstrosity or even allow it to get out the door for that matter already heard from me and i hope all take the time to voice your extreme displeasure a well"
b'i suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the gov in a big hurry i expect that product use these chip will socket them rather than solder them since once the key be hand over by the escrow agency the chip be so much garbage and will need to be replace i expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that us secure encryption -- possibly even disguise so that not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor key if i be to manufacture such a chip a part of my marketing strategy i would try to subvert one or both escrow agency either through bribe or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact do my best not to be connect with such activity -- which would likely not be legal publicly discredit the escrow agency would go quite far towards create a market for a secure alternative i also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread any back- door or weakness would far discredit the scheme and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative i believe that the company that provide such an alternative will make few friend in the le community but lot of money i also believe that the government will do best to make such plug replacement illegal i expect that they will see the same success in limit the availability of such alternative a they have see in limit the availability of certain illicit drug -- ie little to none'
b"to me a large problem be that once disclose your key could be use to decrypt any previously record conversation i gather that from this proposal a warrant would be require to get the key but not to collect conversation consider the scenario where an agency collect preemptively all encrypt conversation for certain people likely to be target and not necessarily `` legitimate '' target then arranges for some unrelated incident that can trigger a warrant `` your honor we know that the suspect have receive call from note crime figure bugsy butthead say call arrange by the agency and we must therefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect in a sensitive govt post be corrupt '' i suppose that it be conceivable that there be session key involve somewhere but that seem likely if there be why the technical overview mention them when it go to such detail a the number of bit held by each escrow authority this scheme be full of hole and stink to high heaven -mel"

b"there be some issue which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspect of the use of the big brother clipper chip the drug dealer and terrorist go to let themselves be caught by use this type of encryption in 1985 the new york time report that government investigator broke up a narcotic ring that be operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allow the leader of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agent who be try to arrest them a mr. deely an nsa official say `` there be a lot of medium-sized country that would have be proud to have the signal intelligence operation of this group '' for every john gotti there be probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risk of unsecure communication be the press give to the big brother chip will only increase their number even if there be some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of big brother it must be weigh against the constitutional and civil liberty question involve for example in some area of the world torture be use a an investigative tool by the local `` law-enforcement '' people i suspect it be an effective mean of obtain information and shorten many investigation it probably also help keep the conviction rate high the fact that the torture tool be not use in this country even with a court order obtain by show `` probable cause '' be because we have rightly balance the question of expediency and what be ethically and morally right i think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when consider the use of big brother i vote for morality i be quite disturbed by what i interpret a a veil threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this big brother chip be not put into wide spread use after a quick reading of the white house press release i come away with that impression to most of the american public the word `` hacker '' have rightly or wrongly come to mean `` high tech adolescent vandal '' it have struck me that most of the people post to sci.crypt regard this issue be intelligent thoughtful individual who have genuine concern about the privacy and constitutional issue surround big brother i hope that the use of big brother do not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal i would hate to see this become some kind of high tech volstead act the high speed digital communication revolution be come at u with the speed of an sst the time they be a change and just a ibm be learn that they do business the same way they have do it for the past 40 year maybe nsa should evaluate another approach eff who have correctly question the cryptographic strength of big brother may need to send a strong message out regard the constitutional issue involve al gore may want to think this one through a little more and a for dorothy elizabeth robling denning en quoi cela vous concerne cheri"
b'perhaps one way of get away from this cripple chip that the u.s. government seem to be push would be to come up with a good alternative for example how about a scheme use rsa and some hybrid of des-cfb and another strong stream cipher maybe idea-cfb this could be substantially the same a the cripple chip except that instead of key-registration the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them with a court- issue warrant then they could read the last few month of wiretapped message sent and assume commit no crime you could generate a new key pair and go about your business i find that be willing to pay rsa for the right to use such a system especially give the alternative if you be unwilling to give up your secret key then probably stay in jail have anyone get a real legal precedent for this this would allow court-issued warrant to be use to gather information on suspect criminal but it be do in secrecy and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed key maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct me but this *seem* like such a big loss in term of law-enforcement capability any comment'
b"i agree that notify your elect official of your feeling on this and any other for that matter issue be the way to go and by the way the phone s on the list post the other day be all in washington d.c. -- for most of you your elect official will also maintain a local office in your area code when i 'manage my elect official i use their local office 's exclusively and my fax modem and windows-print-capture software be my tool of choice they see my word a i have state them rather than a summary a they would if i call in /voice/ and left a comment with the office staff"

b'the clipper chip be just the culmination of dorthy denning et all but let ignore that for the moment the fundamental question be can the government stop me from use encryption ignore for the moment the question of patent process such a public key can the government stop me from use an encryption process if the answer be yes then what freedom we have in this country be truly go and it time to get out the gun or the lawyer depend upon which cause more damage and to whom however assume that i can still encrypt thing a i please who care about the clipper chip a far a concerned a phone line be insecure period i care if they encrypt it 10 way from sunday if i do the encrypt i trust it this be the attitude that everyone else should have instead of worry about a clipper chip simply connect your handset to your computer and feed the voice single through process encrypt and transmit over the phone the guy on the other hand then do the same in reverse work you say no standard you say obviously you have never us pgp anyone who expect the government to protect their freedom be kid themselves only you can protect your own freedom one final thought address to eff 1.do you support the implementation of any form of encryption where the encryption key must be reveal 2.if you do why if not why 3.what specific action be you planning to take to either support or stop this proposal 4.if you do not support this proposal what alternative do you offer the jester'
b'if the administration be this far along be it possible that the government be work on it for a while and have be use the dennings to prime the pump so to speak or a the juda goat whether paid off just gullible or what really matter it might also be possible that the nsa whoever have have the idea for this for quite a while have be promote it denning et al and siezed the new opportunity a new administration who want to spend more money on espionage than bush do whatever not so sure that the cause/effect order be totally obvious'
b"do dorothy denning read this group if not be someone on the group forward question like these to her or martin hellman or anyone else who 's see more detail about the chip of course she do just s be toast so often for be an nsa patsy that s keep her head down you can always mail her directly a denning guvax.acc.georgetown.edu denning cs.cosc.georgetown.edu or denning cs.georgetown.edu"
b"the description of the chip 's operation evidently leaf out some of the key management aspect either the k_p be the secret key correspond to a public key which be broadcast at message initiation or it be the result of a diffie-hellman key exchange or something similar either way there must be some protocol beyond those described here it clear whether they be implement in the clipper wiretap chip or must be provide by other system component"

b"nice to think but naive the fact be that million of people today be send highly confidential information over unencoded easy to receive cellular phone they figure the chance of be heard be small so they risk it and 99.9 of people understand crypto the way the least of the sci.crypt newbie do if clinton tell them good crypto believe him and send important stuff over it and be thankful that no longer use clear-voice fm cellular phone only a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto bad in the eye of the government which swears up and down the algorithim be spook-level secure and it may indeed be the only reason you could possibly want this extra level be to avoid police by use it attract attention a a likely lawbreaker `` your honour the suspect suddenly start use another level of cryptography and we tap his phone call any more he must have something to hide please sign the warrant to search his house ...

b"just a question a a provider of a public bb service you bound by law to gurantee intelligble access to the data of the user on the bb if police come with sufficent authorisation i guess this would be a basic condition for such system i do run a bb some time ago but that be in switzerland the u yet have many law cover bbs not common carrier not phone company just private machine or service operate by business there 's no obligation to keep record a perry metzger point out if the police come with a search warrant you have to let them see what the warrant demand if it exists and they generally can confiscate the equipment a `` evidence '' which be not constitutionally valid but only begin to develop court case support u a court may be able to compel you to tell them information you know such a the encryption password for the disk there any definitive case yet since a new situation and there probably law specifically cover it but the court force you to *know* the key and there be no law prevent you from allow your user to have their own key for their own file without give them to you even in area that do have establish law there be uncertainty there be a guy in idaho a few year ago who have his business record subpoenaed a evidence for tax or some other business-restriction law so he give the court the record which be in hebrew the u have law force you to keep your record in english and these be the original of the record he speak hebrew and neither do anybody in the court organization think they be able to do much about it it might be illegal for your bb to deny access to potential customer base on race religion national origin gender or sexual preference it probably be test in court but it seem like a plausible extension of anti-discrimination law affect other business"

b"the algorithm be classify because a military contract or similar government equivalent to military have be let for this `` proprietary '' design that the fed say that nsa developed be there a patent be that patent publicly available my bet be that that too be classify unless there have be a _major_ change in the law there 's no such beast a a `` classify patent '' patent exist to encourage communication and develop the state of the art while there classify patent there be `` patent secrecy order '' suppose you invent a voice scrambler for cb radio and apply for a patent the patent office decides the nsa might be interested give them a copy of your application and you get a nice note back say your patent application have now be classify for national security reason and no longer allow to make and sell it pick this example because it happen in the late 1970s it be probably some analog scrambler and would have probably violate fcc rule anyway but it do get classify or suppose you publish a paper on your really spiffy algorithm and then file a patent application since be publish they gain anything by classify it though you get patent in most country other than the u where patent law be different obviously a system of classify patent would be highly bogus '' you sell that widget because there 's a classify patent on it not allow to see the patent or know who own the design so just give u all your money and work in progress and maybe we throw you in jail for espionage '' some country might have that kind of system but we have that here quite yet"

b"a promise i spoke today with the company mention in a washington time article about the clipper chip announcement the name of the company be secure communicatiions technology information will be give at the end of this message on how to contact them basically they be disturbed about the announcement for many reason that we be more specifically however mr. bryen of secure communication brought to light many point that might interest most of the reader his belief be that at t be make know of the clipper well before the rest of the industry this be for several reason several of which be a company of at t 's size could never be able to make a decision to use the new chip on the same day it be announce month ago they propose use their own chip for at t 's secure telephone device at t basically blew them off a be not interested at all this stuck them a strange until now ... also i spoke with art melnick their cryptographer he express several concern over the new clipper chip the obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code once the key be release to authority the security of the crypto system be lose forever these key can end up in the hand of any agency of the government the fact that the escrowed key never change mean that the algorithm be vulnerable over time to an attacker the classify algorithm may hide another backdoor but he feel that it be probably to keep people from forge fake serial number or change the key themselves additionally he feel that the nsa have probably spent enough time and money in work on a way to keep this chip from be reverse engineer that he feel that reverse engineering it will be very difficult to do he feel that they have developed a suitable technique to protect the chip from this attack also he feel that the chip be hardware encode with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip additonally i spoke with mr. melnick about their algorithm he tell me much about their new agorithm because it be patent yet however he told me a little the algorithm will be release for public review after patent have be grant for it this be so the crypto community can see that it be secure the algorithm be call nea for new encryption algorithm the detail be sketchy because now it be held a a trade secret until the patent be issue but i be told that it will incorporate the follow it will have fast encryption of data exact spec not give but mr. melnick state `` much faster than what an rs-232 can put out '' it be a symmetric cipher just like idea and de it will use 64 bit data block for encryption like de and idea the key length be not give to me but mr. melnick state that it be _adujustable_ and be `` more than adequate for security '' the algorithm be write in c and assembler in software form and can be port to many platform unlike the the clipper chip which be hardware only and can not be make into software this i consider a definite plus for the nea for widespread use the algorithm will accomodate public key distribution technique such a rsa or diffie-hellman this will also be support in the hardware chip right now the project cost of the nea chip will be about 10 dollar for each clipper will run 25 each chip that be if it be produce enough which probably happen they currently sell a program call c-com that us the algorithm and a special stream protocol that do not divide the encrypt data into `` block '' this could prevent plaintext attack if you know what the block header be this program operates at all support rs-232 speed and us the software implementation of the algorithm most importantly it do not have a backdoor right now the company be afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business this be a very real possibility so they really need help in stop the clipper chip from become a standard if you want to contact them they can be reach at.. secure communication technology 8700 georgia ave. suite 302 silver spring md 301 588-2200 i talk to mr. bryen who represent the company he can answer any question you have any factual error occur in this write up be my own and i apologize for them ahead of time"
