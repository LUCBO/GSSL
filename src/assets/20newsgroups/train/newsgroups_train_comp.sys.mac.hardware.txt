b'hi everyone i recently post about how i receive a bad vram chip for my new lciii and someone respond that it may not actually be bad but it may be a 512k lc vram chip and thus work properly with my computer so wonder if anyone can interpret these code for me so i can figure out what type of chip macconnection sent me 2515251 on the back of the card it say 0593 i believe from the number that mean it be an 80ns chip but i figure out what the size be suppose to be if anyone can help be grateful please email me your response thanks a lot -- hillel sims -- -- simsh rpi.edu -- -- rensselaer polytechnic institute'

b"my friend recently purchase a lc iii and he want to know if there be such a demon call nubus adapter for his pd slot the lc family of mac can only use pd card they be not able to use nubus ah but why can some technically-hip macslinger tell u what the difference be between pd and nubus be it impossible to make a gadget that plug into pd and end in a nubus card cage at least marvin 's friend have not be able to locate one and neither have i. what be the fundamental reason for this i think that there do exist nubus expansion cage sure see them advertised occassionally but i think that the main problem be that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a lc and iivx so unless you need lot of nubus slot it not worth the bother of course it may be that these extra box be so expensive because no one buy them because they be so expensive ... nubus technology a special apple proprietry thing i have this sneaky feel that it be license from texas instrument so there be no problem building an expansion box the difference between nubus and pd be that nubus be a clever interface with lot of neat toy built in to make sure that lot of card can work together on the same computer pd processor direct slot be just that here be all the connection to the processor you can do anything with this and it be a quick a it can be but there 's no cooperation you may be able to get double pd slot adaptor but you try plug 2 video card in and just watch them conflict of course the extra electronics in a nubus slot make it appreciably more expensive so guess why apple put it in cheaper machine so yah pay yer money and yah take yah choice"

both mac ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card expansion mac plus only some monitor and cd-rom main problem there be a lot of external device which be internal terminate which cause problem for more then two devise off the scsi port a scsi chain be suppose to be terminate only at the begining and at the end any other set up cause problem for either mac or ibm scsi-1 7 device per scsi controller 8-bit asynchronous ~1.5mb/s ave and synchronous 5mb/s max transfer difference be due to scsi-1 software driver `` fast scsi-1 '' be a misname for 8-bit scsi-2 in scsi-1 mode see scsi-2 for detail scsi-2 10 device per scsi controller in scsi-2 mode scsi-2 be fully scsi-1 compliant and 8-bit scsi-2 tends to be implement a a very fast scsi-1 since it do not require the different controller interface in hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit scsi-2 do transfer speed be 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst 8-bit 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst 16-bit and 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst 32-bit/wide and fast since 8-bit scsi-2 can use scsi-1 software driver and hardware at 8-bit scsi-2 speed and a such be limited to 7 device sometimes it be mistakenly call `` fast scsi-1 '' 16-bit fast scsi-2 require a scsi-2 software driver and scsi-2 electronics but can still use the scsi-1 port wide 16-bit and 32-bit scsi-2 require a different scsi port electronics and software driver from scsi-1 which make them more expensive than other scsi interface mac scsi asynchronous scsi-1 built-in standard since the plus even though apple developed some specification for scsi controlers the o scsi manager need to be rewrite to take full advantage of the feature of both scsi interface a a result present scsi-2 mac use 8-bit scsi-2 a a fast asynchronous scsi-1 presently quadras be the only mac with a scsi-2 controller chip built-in digital review oct 21 1991 v8 n33 p8 1 though they lack some other part of

by 32-bits at a time and be use in ibms the mac do a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every memory location if something be seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicate what the problem be since mac make before feb 15 1993 manage memory baced on data path simms have to be instal in pair 16-bit or in set of 4 32-bit the centris 650 and quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time if the simms be the same size be use then the memory be 'interleaved across the two

b"ben since obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball work the only thing short of repair it that i can think of be a thorough cleaning of all the part and then check for the proper placement of the little blue roller since they fix in position on their stainless steel pin you might try slide them into a slightly different position on my powerbook 100 i can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball in fact one of the note from sumex on fix the trackball advocate slide the roller so that it _edge_ contact the ball not the center cylindrical area do this with my pb100 and it do seem to improve the feel but need to be adjust from time to time i just popped open one of our office 's pb170s and while there a much latitude for movement one could still adjust the roller slightly if your pb140 be the same it might help i would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller if you can take it out clean it with a mild soapy solution or isopropyl alcohol also be sure the ball be grease-free if you drop the ball in minus the retain ring roll the ball and see if it be actually cause the axle to spin if all this still solve it then maybe a new one be in order it could be an electrical connection in which case replacement would be necessary but my experience with both mouse and trackball have be that dirt have be the normal problem not an electrical malfunction hope this help murray"

b"or there okay i guess it time for a quick explanation of mac sound the original documentation for the sound hardware im-3 document how to make sound by directly access hardware basically you jam value into all the even byte from soundbase to soundbase+0x170 this be because of how the mac 128 and some later machine generate sound be by scan this block and d/aing every even byte the odd byte go to the floppy on some machine when the mac ii and apple sound chip be invent it be design to generate stereo sound it be also design to be compatible with we have once document so store byte at the even value at soundbase meant `` i want to play a mono sound '' and so it be emulate but apple have since retract the documentation on soundbase and decide not to document the low layer of sound generation so apple never explain where to stuff byte if you want to make stereo sound enter game developer the sound driver and current sound manager be inconveniently lame for make game furthermore people who port from the ibm want to learn more apis so it have become popular for game writer to write to soundbase to make sound since it be very easy since the mac ii apple have have many different kind of sound output hardware and the only thing they have in common be that write to soundbase work on some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici at least write to soundbase get you mono sound through both speaker on some mac quadra 700/900/950 at least write to soundbase get you mono sound on the left channel only both be technically correct interpretation of the original specification but one be obviously preferable for asthetic reason if developer use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sound will typically come out through both channel regardless of the underlie hardware it be possible to specify you want to generate left channel only but no one do if developer write to sound base their game will only come out the left on some game the other problem the original mac ii only produce left channel sound on the internal speaker while the se/30 mix both really related it be due to the post generation amplification use on the motherboards of the different machine it only affect true stereo sound sound which be actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have now to more directly address the question the game you list and also hellcat super tetri oxyd and many more these be just what test cheat and write to soundbase and so be only left channel on quadras other game you list and also pga tour golf civilization and more these be again only from personal experience use the sound manager and work fine on all machine the more of the story be to developer do n't cheat really i be absolutely positively not allow to do what i be about to do but go say it anyway stop cheat on sound really soon you will be sorry a even those without external speaker will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period be about to end the sound manager be understandable now and work pretty well and will work even well soon so use it in conclusion to doug it a hardware problem at least not a bug to jon it a choice to developer a to whether they want to send sound to both channel if they do it the right way it be take care of automatically if you cheat there be not way to make it work on all hardware have fun disclaimer number 1 i work on sound here at apple just pretty well inform so write me with sound question disclaimer number 2 if it say up above that i write anything like `` the grace period be about to end '' then it be a bug in your news feed since i be catagorically not allow to say anything like that you know what i mean disclaimer number 3 i speak for apple just me"

b'i too have be watch the iisi speedup report and plan to upgrade in the next few week the plan i have be to build a small board with a few different crystal on it and to be able to switch between the different speed use a front pannel switch this way i can get the speed when i want but i can also run at slow stock speed it i experience any compatability problem with any application i expect to be able to switch clock speed with the system run but if i can switch without any lock-up problem then i could switch to 33mhz when need and put it back to idle 20 mhz when not needeed this would far reduce the wear-and-tear on the cpu even with a heat sink of course i would not want to run the different clock signal through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desire and route it directly to the mother board i start probe around inside my si yet do anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators'

b'i see much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac we would like to try it and i wonder if someone have some good advice we have a mac iicx with the original internal quantum 40mb hard disk and an unusable floppy drive we also have a new spare connor 40mb disk which we would like to use the idea be to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seem to be some problem the internal scsi cable and power cable inside the cx have only connector for one single hard disk drive if i make a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connector each 1 for motherboard 1 for each of the 2 disk would it work be the iicx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk what about terminator i suppose that i should remove the resistor pack from the disk that be closest to the motherboard but leave them instal in the other disk the scsi id jumper should also be change so that the new disk get id 1. the old one should have id 0. it be no problem for u to remove the floppy drive a we have an external floppy that we can use if it boot of the hard disk thank you'

b'i think this kind of comparison be pretty useless in general the processor be only good when a good computer be design around it adn the computer be use in it design purpose compare processor speed be pretty dumb because all you have to do be just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other thing i mean how can you say a 040 be faster than a 486 without give be operational condition can you say the same when you be run a program that us a lot of transidental function know that 040 do not have transidental function building in to it fpu and 486 do can you say that 040 be still faster anyway i hope people do not decide upon wether a computer be good or not solely on it processor or how fast a processor be base on it name because one can alway do a certain thing to a processor to speed it up but if we restrict our arguements to for example pure processor architectural issue or how one processor will work well and another will not base on it design then we can get somewhere with our discussion chung yang'

b"patrickd wpi.wpi.edu lazer writes ... spec for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book some highlight be ... 32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width 18 32-bit integer register 8 80-bit float point register 8k copyback capable cache 4-way set associative typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction 5 clock for a float point multiply interest aside the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit float point number in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integer more of the same but with multiple instruction dispatch figure about 0.8 clock per instruction typical my guess but the motorola guy be pretty bright it may be less call motorola not type it all in predict that both the 680x0 and x86 line be reach their end new experimental processor have 64-bit data pathway and can schedule up to 8 out of 32 instruction each clock cycle that sort of trick really be do with cisc architecture i finally saw some detail on the 586/pentium and be not greatly impressed they 've finally do some work on the fpu to get it up to speed but otherwise only go to be a 2x speedup and to get that use two integer unit large cache and a branch target buffer yes i know talk about 100mhz processor big whoop design a 100mhz board be difficult and really expensive price 15ns memory chip lately"
