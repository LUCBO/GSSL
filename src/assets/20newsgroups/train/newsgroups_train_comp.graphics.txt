b"hi everyone because no one have touch the problem i post last week i guess my question be not so clear now like to describe it in detail the offset of an ellipse be the locus of the center of a circle which roll on the ellipse in other word the distance between the ellipse and it offset be same everywhere this problem come from the geometric measurement when a probe be use the tip of the probe be a ball and the computer just output the position of the ball 's center be the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse the answer be no ironically dmis an american indutrial standard say it be ellipse so almost all the software which be implement on the base of dmis be wrong the software be also sell internationaly imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug how many qualify part with ellipse were/will be discard and most importantly how many defective part with ellipse are/will be use i be employ a a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem i spent two month on analysis of this problem and six month on program now my solution nonlinear be not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from it entire or half offset it be very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of it offset because the method i use be not analytical i be now wonder if i touch the base and make thing complicate please give me a hint i know you may argue this be not a cg problem you be right it be not however so many people involve in the problem `` sphere from 4 poits '' why not an ellipse and why not it offset please post here and let the others share our interest i get several email from our netters they say they need the summary of the answer"
b'hi all in short look for very fast assembly code for line/circle draw on svga graphic complete i be think of a simple but fast molecular graphic program to write on pc or clone ball-and-stick type reason program that see be far too slow for this purpose platform 386/486 class machine 800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 vga graphic speed be important 16-color for non-rendering purpose be enough may stay at 800x600 for speed reason hope the code would be generic enough for different svga card my own card be base on trident 8900c not vesa what look for 1 fast very fast routine to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes on above-mentioned svga resolution presumably in assembly languagine yes very fast please 2 related code to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawing on screen drawing for begin would be line circle mainly think of text else later you know the way molecular graphic rotates zoom a molecule 2 and any other code preferentially in c that can help the project final remark non-profit expect to become share- free-ware any help be appreciate thanks -frankie lau tammy.harvard.edu'

b"first off thanks to all who have fill me in on the existence of the 68070. i assume rashly that the particular number would be reserve for far enhancement to the motorola line rather than meted out to another company ah well i guess what i get when i assume the computer industry will operate in a logical manner a spot version 1.5 of quicktime be a have be state the current version of the software the old version be 1.0 and 1.6 be on the horizon in the not too distant future back quite 25x by that it he quicktime do a much well job of play back movie at size than it do play back resize movie apparently the process of expand each frame 's image and dither the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth be pretty processor-intensive there be optimizers that work pretty well for show movie at double size but if you drop to 1.9x size or increase to 2.1x size performance suffers dramatically know quicktime he lie quicktime be very cpu dependent he be probably confuse by the fact that qt be lock to an internal timecode and will play in the same amount of time on any machine however an lc will drop frame in order to keep the sound and video sync up the centris and quadras have similar cpu and will thus boast similar performance though the quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speed and somewhat different architecture have be i expect that the version of the quicktime software you saw be 1.0 -- i be use be 1.5. one of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate a what version 1.0 could handle the centris 650 i saw be a plain-vanilla with the exception of the nice speaker that be play the sound and the software be movie player the qt player apple include with the software"

b"re majority of user not readding from floppy well how about those of u who have 1400-picture cd-rom and would like to use cview because it be fast and it work well but because the moron lack the foresight to create the temp file in the program 's path not the current didrectory actually the most flexible way to create temp file be to check for a temp or tmp environment variable and create the file on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable this be pretty much a standard for do window and os/2 application unfortunately cview do not pay attention to the temp environment variable"

b"i plan to post a summary of response to this a soon a i have work code which i will also include the intersection of 3 plane method look best but my implementation base on a short article in graphic gem i work i may be misinterpret of course i have avoid the simultaneous solution of the plane equation in favor of dot and cross product but the former may actually be well in either case a matrix determinant need to be compute implicitly in the solution of linear equation to get the plane i be take the midpoint of the line from say p1 to p2 and set the normal a the `` normalize '' vector from p1 to p2 these just plug into the formula in graphic gem however the result center point be only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test point for different test my matrix/vector math be very rusty but it look like i need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bring in another routine i have but should be easy to find another method be to first find the center of the circle define by 2 set of 3 point and intersect the normal from there this would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecision would make the line not intersect supposedly 3 plane have to intersect in a unique point if they be not parallel ed thanks to all who answer so far"

b"hi everyone i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these group *******announcing the release of multiverse-1.0.2******* multiverse be a multi-user non-immersive x-windows base virtual reality system primarily focus on entertainment/research feature client-server base model use berkeley socket no limit to the number of user apart from performance generic client customizable server hierachical object allow attachment of camera and light source multiple light source ambient point and spot object can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attach functionality client the client be built around a 'fast render loop basically it change thing when told to by the server and then render an image from the user's viewpoint it also provide the server with information about the user's action which can then be communicate to other client and therefore to other user the client be design to be generic in other word you need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this mean that resource can be spent on enhance the client software rather than adapt it the adaptation a will be explain in a moment occur in the server this release of the client software support the follow functionality o hierarchical object with associate address o multiple light source and type ambient point and spot o user interface panel o colour polygonal render with phong shade optional wireframe for faster frame rate o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software support the powerglove a an input device this be not because it but because i have one this will however be one of the first enhancement server s this be where customization can take place the follow basic support be provide in this release for potential world server developer o transparent client management o client message handle this may not sound like much but it take away the headache of accept and terminate client and receive message from them the application writer can work with the assumption that thing be happen locally thing get more interest in the object extension functionality this be what be provide to allow you to animate your object o server selectable extension installation what this mean be that you can decide which object have extend functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extension for an object you basically write callback function for the event that you want the object to respond to current event support init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision event just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activate when a collision occurs this software be kept separate from the worldserver application because the application developer want to build a library of extend object from which to choose the follow be all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this be where you choose what object extension will be support plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this be where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this be where you load the world .wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this be where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this be where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the object move by call a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrun the client all there be to it and to prove it here be the line count for the three world server provide generic 81 line dactyl 270 line more complicate collision detection due to the stair will probably be improve with future version dogfight 72 line location this software be locate at the follow site ftp.u.washington.edu directory pub/virtual-worlds file multiverse-1.0.2.tar.z future client o texture mapping o more realistic render i.e z-buffering or similar gouraud shade o hmd support o etc etc ... server o physical model gravity friction etc o enhance object management/interaction o etc etc ... both o improve comms i hope this provide people with a good understand of the multiverse software unfortunately it come with practically zero documentation and not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectify i hope people enjoy this software and that it be useful in our exploration of the virtual universe certainly found fascinate develop it and i would *love* to add support for the powerglove ... and an hmd finally one major disclaimer this be totally amateur code by that i mean there

b"sean the 68070 exists sean i want to get into a 'mini-war by what i be go to say but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you be claim on the centris see why please no-flames i reserve those for c.s.m.a i be in chicago in the last consumer electronics show and apple have a booth there i walk by and they be show real-time video capture use a radious or supermac card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movie i think the quicktime they be use be the old one 1.5 they digitize a guy talk there in 160x2xx something it played back quite nicely and in real time the guy then expand the window resize to 25x by 3xx 320 in y i think and the frame rate decrease enough to notice that it 30fps or about 30fps anymore it drop to like 15 fps then he increase it just a bit more and it drop to 10 12 fps then i ask him what mac he be use ... he be use a quadra know what model 900 to do it and he be tell the guy there that the quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an lcii well i spoil his claim so to say since a 68040 quadra mac be have a little bit of trouble and this even from the hardisk this be from memory could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assist centris or another software product run the animation like supposedly macromind 's accelerator misunderstand me i just want to clarify this but for the sake of the post about a computer do it or not i can claim 320x200 a tad more with overscan be do in 256,000+ color in my computer not from the hardisk at 30fps with scala mm210 but i agree if we consider mpeg stuff i think a multimedia consumer low-priced box have a lot of market ... i just think 3do would make it no longer cd-i"
b"about a year ago i start work on a problem that appear to be very simple and turn out to be quite difficult i be wonder if anyone on the net have see this problem and hopefully some publish solution to it the problem be to draw an outline of a surface define by two roughly parallel cubic spline for input the problem essentially start with two set of point where each set of point be on the edge of an object which we treat a two dimensional i.e only extant between the edge but which exists in three dimensional space to draw the object we 1 fit a cubic spline through the point each spline be effectively compute a a sequence of line segment approximate the curve each spline have an equal number of segment we assume that the nth segment along each spline be roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure 2 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the oppose spline use the pair of segment to form two triangle which will be fill in to color the surface 3 depth sort the triangle 4 take each triangle in sort order project onto a 2d pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that be along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge color with a special `` edge color '' it be the edge color in step 4 that be at the heart of the problem the idea be to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally have lot of break and gap in the edge of the surface the reason for this be fairly complicate they involve both rasterization problem and problem result from the project the spline if anything about this problem sound familiar we would appreciate know about other work in this area"

b"rather than decide which book you want to buy you need to decide which program interface you want to use then buy the appropriate book i write an article for the x resource which discus the difference between phigs and pexlib it will appear in issue 6 which should be out pretty soon but here 's a brief summary ... phigs be a graphic api which be design to be portable to many device most implementation support the x window system and take advantage of a 3d extension to x call `` pex '' pexlib be a slightly '' low '' level api which be design to efficiently support the pex extension to x. some advantage of use pexlib ... integrates with xlib xt motif etc well than phigs provide immediate mode capability be free of `` policy '' pex support phigs but be currently be extend to support feature not found in phigs like texture mapping anti-aliasing pexlib will give you access to all of these feature some advantage of use phigs ... support for multiple device not just x base one support for archive metafiles hardcopy output phigs have predefined input device to make input easy phigs can handle exposure event and resize for you phigs can help you with colormap selection/creation if work strictly in x and care about thing like archive i would go with pexlib either way you will find that both api 's have a lot in common"

correct e-mail address to reply to -- -- -- -- -- 1 what be jpeg jpeg pronounce `` jay-peg '' be a standardize image compression mechanism jpeg stand for joint photographic expert group the original name of the committee that write the standard jpeg be design for compress either full-color or gray-scale digital image of `` natural '' real-world scene it do not work so well on non-realistic image such a cartoon or line drawing jpeg do not handle black-and-white 1-bit-per-pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg be `` lossy '' meaning that the image you get out of decompression quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of it compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail perceive a well a small detail of light-and-dark thus jpeg be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine-analyze your image the small error introduce by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg be that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjust compression parameter this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make *extremely* small file if you mind poor quality this be useful for index image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you happy with the output quality at the default compression set you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept lesser compression 2 why use jpeg there be two good reason to make your image file small and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data make image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archive library of image be able to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare gif and jpeg the size ratio be more like four to one more detail below if your view software support jpeg directly have to convert jpeg to some other format for view or manipulate image even with a jpeg-capable viewer it take longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus use jpeg be essentially a time/space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a shorter file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file i 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif a a standard usenet post format be that jpeg can store full color information 24 bits/pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or few color if you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though 8-bit gif will look a obsolete a black-and-white macpaint format do today furthermore for reason detailed in section 7 jpeg be far more useful than gif for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware hence jpeg be considerably more appropriate than gif for use a a usenet post standard 3 when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg be *not* go to displace gif entirely for some type of image gif be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about jpeg be which kind of image to apply it to a a rule of thumb jpeg be superior to gif for store full-color or gray-scale image of `` realistic '' scene that mean scan photograph and similar material jpeg be superior even if you have 24-bit display hardware and it be a lot superior if you do see section 7 for detail gif do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such a cartoon and line drawing in particular large area of pixel that be all *exactly* the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg squeeze these file a much a gif do without introduce visible defect this sort of image be best kept in gif form in particular single-color border be quite cheap in gif file but they should be avoid in jpeg file jpeg also have a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure-black pixel adjacent to a row of pure-white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blur unless you use a very high quality set again this sort of thing be not found in scan photograph but it show up fairly often in gif file border overlaid text etc the blurriness be particularly objectionable with text only a few pixel high if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text jpeg it computer-drawn image ray-traced scene for instance usually fall between scan image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same go for semi-realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such plain black-and-white two level image should never be convert to jpeg you need at least about 16 gray level before jpeg be useful for gray-scale image it should also be note that gif be lossless for gray-scale image of up to 256 level while jpeg be not if you have an exist library of gif image you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argues that jpeg image quality be superior to gif only applies if both format start from a full-color original if you start from a gif already irretrievably lose a great deal of information jpeg can only make thing bad however the disk space saving may justify convert anyway this be a decision have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section 14 for hint be prepared to leave some image in gif format since some gifs will not convert well 4 how well do jpeg compress image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image i have handy a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purpose the rest be create with the free jpeg software described in section 6b file size in byte comment ship.ppm 1145040 original file in ppm format no compression 24 bit or 3 byte per pixel plus a few byte overhead ship.ppm.z 963829 ppm file pass through unix compress compress accomplish a lot note other text-oriented compressor give similar result ship.gif 240438 convert to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 ppmtogif most of the saving be the result of lose color info gif save 8 bits/pixel not 24 see sec 7 ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -q 95 high useful quality set this be indistinguishable from the 24-bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeball ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -q 75 default set you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on-screen at once ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -q 50 this have slight defect if you know what to look for you could tell be jpeged without see the original still a good image quality a many recent posting in usenet picture group ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -q 25 jpeg 's characteristic `` blockiness '' becomes apparent at this set djpeg -blocksmooth help some still see plenty of usenet posting that be of poorer image quality than this ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize -optimize cut table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or index purpose note that this file be tiny the compression ratio from the original be 173:1 in this case jpeg can make a file a factor of four or five small than a gif of comparable quality the -q 75 file be every bit a good a the gif well if you have a full-color display this seem to be a typical ratio for real-world scene 5 what be good `` quality '' setting for jpeg most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by select a quality set there seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting `` quality 95 '' do not mean `` keep 95 of the information '' a some have claimed the quality scale be purely arbitrary not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use jpeg be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this set will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality set -q 75 be very often the best choice this set be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try -q 75 first if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above -q 95 say -q 100 will produce a file two or three time a large a -q 95 but of hardly any well quality if the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a high quality set to avoid far degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gifs to jpeg the default -q 75 be about right for compress 24-bit image but -q 85 to 95 be usually well for convert gifs see section 14 for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or index purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a -q set in the range of 5 to 10 be about right -q 2 or so may be amuse a `` op art '' note the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such a image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program even provide a numeric scale just '' high '' '' medium '' '' low '' -style choice 6 where can i get jpeg software most of the program described in this section be available by ftp if you know how to use ftp see the faq article `` how to find source '' if you have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in news.answers or you can get it by send e-mail to mail-server rtfm.mit.edu with '' send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources '' in the body the `` anonymous ftp list faq '' may also be helpful -- usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive note this list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late jpeg faq from the news.answers archive 6a if you be look for `` can '' software viewer etc the first part of this list be system-specific program that only run on one kind of system if you see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over internet but some commercial program be list too x window john bradley 's free xv version 2.00 and up be an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image format available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu the file be call 'xv- .tar.z where be the version number currently 2.21 it be locate in the 'contrib directory on export or the 'pub/xv directory at upenn xv reduces all image to 8 bit internally which mean not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display still get only 8-bit color also you use xv to convert full-color image to jpeg because get color-quantized first but xv be a fine tool for convert gif and other 8-bit image to jpeg caution there be a glitch in version 2.21 and earlier be sure to check the `` save at normal size '' checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x window be john cristy 's free imagemagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z this package handle many image processing and conversion task the imagemagick viewer handle 24-bit display correctly for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support jpeg in it late release 3.03. xloadimage be free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.z xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it have the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 be use a hacked-over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z both program be say to do the right thing with 24-bit display ms-dos this cover plain do for window or os/2 program see the next heading one good choice be eric praetzel 's free dvpeg which view jpeg and gif file the current version 2.4a be available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca 129.97.50.50 file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip this be a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386/486 machine the user interface be not flashy but functional another freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer be mohammad rezaei 's hiview the current version 1.2 be available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip hiview require a 386 or well cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager qemm386 and 386max work window and os/2 do not hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen for large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning/scrolling a most viewer do you may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no deny that it slows down load of large image considerably note installation be a bit tricky read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be colorview for do 30 this be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative it user interface be also much spiffier-looking although personally i find it harder to use -- more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be faster than dvpeg but a little slow than hiview at least on my hardware for image large than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both be faster than hiview the current version be 2.1 available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip require a vesa graphic driver if you have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory many recent pc have a built-in vesa driver so try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver be miss a second shareware alternative be fullview which have be kick around the net for a while but i know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway the author tell me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the simtel20 archive at that time the well-known gif viewer compushow cshow support jpeg in it late revision 8.60a however cshow 's jpeg implementation very good slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi-color display too bad ... it 'd have be nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware 25 available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic hardware any one of these viewer might not work on your particular machine if you get *any* of them to work need to use one of the follow conversion program to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi-color hardware use gif a the intermediate format try to find a targa-capable viewer instead vpic5.0 be repute to do the right thing with hi-color display the independent jpeg group 's free jpeg converter be ftpable from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extend memory these file be do compilation of the free source code described in section 6b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm format handmade software offer free jpeg gif conversion tool gif2jpg/jpg2gif these be slow and be limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you get 24-bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tool be that they will read and write hsi 's proprietary jpeg format a well a the usenet-standard jfif format since hsi-format file be rather widespread on bbs this be a useful capability version 2.0 of these tool be free prior version be shareware get it from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip note do not use hsi format for file to be post on internet since it be not readable on non-pc platform handmade software also have a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg file both jfif and hsi format to and from many other image format it can also display image a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.1 be available from simtel20 and mirror site see note below file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip note about simtel20 the internet 's key archive site for pc-related program be simtel20 full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil 192.88.110.20 simtel20 run a non-unix system with weird directory name where this document refers to directory eg `` msdos/graphics '' at simtel20 that really mean '' pd1 msdos.graphics '' if you be not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rate from simtel20 there be several internet site that maintain copy mirror of the simtel20 archive most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead a popular usa mirror site be oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117 which keep simtel20 file in eg `` /pub/msdos/graphics '' if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve file from simtel20 by e-mail see informational posting in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how if you be outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your near simtel20 mirror be microsoft window there be several window program capable of display jpeg image window viewer be generally slow than do viewer on the same hardware due to window system overhead note that you can run the do conversion program described above inside a window do window the new entry be winecj which be free and extremely fast version 1.0 be available from ftp.rahul.net file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip require window 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode this be a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality be noticeably bad than other viewer but so fast use it anyway at least for preview ... jview be freeware fairly fast have good on-line help and can write out the decompress image in window bmp format but it create new jpeg file and it view gifs jview also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer such a brightness adjustment but an excellent basic viewer the current version 0.9 be available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.84 file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip mirror of this archive can be found at some other internet site include wuarchive.wustl.edu winjpeg shareware 20 display jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image file it can write all of these format too so it can be use a a converter it have some other nifty feature include color-balance adjustment and slideshow the current version be 2.1 available from simtel20 and mirror site see note above file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip this be a slow 286-compatible version if you register get the 386-only version which be roughly 25 faster colorview be another shareware entry 30 this be an early and promising contender but it have not be update in some time and at this point it have no real advantage over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version be 0.97 available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip i understand that a new version will be appear once the author be finish with colorview for do dvpeg see do head also work under window but only in full-screen mode not in a window os/2 the follow file be available from hobbes.nmsu.edu 128.123.35.151 note check /pub/uploads for more recent version -- the hobbes moderator be not very fast about move uploads into their permanent directory /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free ijg conversion program version 4 /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip

0.84 jpeg/gif/bmp viewer gif view very fast jpeg view fast if you have huge amount of ram otherwise about the same speed a the above program strong 24-bit display support shareware 20 macintosh most mac jpeg program rely on apple 's jpeg implementation which be part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime instal to use quicktime you need a 68020 or well cpu and you need to be run system 6.0.7 or later if run system 6 you must also install the 32-bit quickdraw extension this be built-in on system 7 you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx a of 11/92 this file contains quicktime 1.5 which be well than qt 1.0 in several way with respect to jpeg it be marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some application seem to have compatibility problem with qt 1.5 mac user should keep in mind that quicktime 's jpeg format pict/jpeg be not the same a the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format see section 10 for detail if you post image on usenet make sure they be in jfif format most of the program mention below can generate either format the first choice be probably jpegview a free program for view image that be in jfif format pict/jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg format the current version 2.0 be a big improvement over prior version get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx require system 7 and quicktime on 8-bit display jpegview usually produce the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewer jpegview can view large image in much less memory than other mac viewer in fact the only one that can deal with jpeg image much over 640x480 pixel on a typical 4mb mac give a large image jpegview automatically scale it down to fit on the screen rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer you can zoom in on any desire portion though some people like this behavior some overall jpegview 's user interface be very well thought out gifconverter a shareware 40 image viewer/converter support jfif and pict/jpeg a well a gif and several other image format the late version be 2.3.2. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx require system 6.0.5 or later gifconverter be not well than jpegview a a plain jpeg/gif viewer but it have much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth it shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image also the new version of gifconverter can load and save jfif image *without* quicktime so it be your best bet if your machine be too old to run quicktime but faster with quicktime note if gifconverter run out of memory try to load a large jpeg try convert the file to gif with jpeg convert then view the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utility be available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx this will run on any mac but it only do file conversion not view you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous version of this faq recommend imagery jpeg v0.6 a jpeg gif converter base on an old version of the ijg code if you be use this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple 's free program pictpixie can view image in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these format you can get pictpixie from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx require quicktime pictpixie be intend a a developer 's tool and really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of it drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface bad pictpixie be an unsupported program meaning it have some minor bug that apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of pictpixie call pictcompressor float around the net if you have this you should trash it a even buggier also the quicktime starter kit include a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie call picture compressor note that picture compressor be not free and may not be distribute on the net storm technology 's picture decompress be a free jpeg viewer/converter this rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without system 7 or quicktime so you may be force to use it on old system it do need 32-bit quickdraw so really old machine use it you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx you must set the file type of a download image file to 'jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine be too old to run 32-bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter be your only choice for single-program jpeg view if you want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac application be support jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format adobe photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write jfif-format jpeg file use the jpeg plug-in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a download jpeg file to 'jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most program list in this section be store in the aminet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch 130.60.80.80 there be many mirror site of this archive and you should try to use the closest one in the usa a good choice be wuarchive.wustl.edu look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ ... hamlab plus be an excellent jpeg viewer/converter a well a be a general image manipulation tool cheap shareware 20 and can read several format besides jpeg the current version be 2.0.8. a demo version be available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch and mirror site file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha the demo version will crop image large than 512x512 but it be otherwise fully functional rend24 shareware 30 be an image renderer that can display jpeg ilbm and gif image the program can be use to create animation even capture frame on-the-fly from render package like lightwave the current version be 1.05 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch and mirror site file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha note although this directory be supposedly for amigados 3.0 program the program will also run under amigados 1.3 2.04 or 2.1 viewtek be a free jpeg/ilbm/gif/anim viewer the current version be 1.04 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch and mirror site file amiga/gfx/show/viewtek104.lha if willing to spend real money there be several commercial package that support jpeg two be write by thomas krehbiel the author of rend24 and viewtek these be cinemorph a standalone image morph package and imagefx an impressive 24-bit image capture conversion edit painting effect and prepress package that also include cinemorph both be distribute by great valley product art department professional adpro from asdg inc be the most widely use commercial image manipulation software for amigas imagemaster from black belt system be another well-regarded commercial graphic package with jpeg support the free ijg jpeg software be available compile for amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch and mirror site in directory amiga/gfx/conv file amigajpegv4.lha these program convert jpeg to/from ppm gif targa format the amiga world be heavily infest with quick-and-dirty jpeg program many base on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software thanks to a certain magazine that publish same on it disk-of-the-month without so much a notify the author among these be `` augjpeg '' `` newamyjpeg '' '' vjpeg '' and probably others i have not even heard of in my opinion anything old than ijg version 3 march 1992 be not worth the disk space store on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer atari st the free ijg jpeg software be available compile for atari st tt etc from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo these program convert jpeg to/from ppm gif targa format i have not heard of any free or shareware jpeg-capable viewer for ataris but surely there must be one by now pointer appreciate acorn archimedes changefsi supply with risc o 3 version 3.10 can convert from and view jpeg jfif format provision be also make to convert image to jpeg although this must be do from the cli rather than by double-clicking recent version since 7.11 of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg along with about 30 other image format while old version can be found on some archimedes bboards the current version be only available by register with the author john kortink nutterbrink 31 7544 wj enschede the netherlands price 35 dutch guilder about 22 or 10 pound there 's also a commercial product call jpeg which provide jpeg read/write functionality and direct jpeg view a well a a host of other image format conversion and processing option this be more expensive but not necessarily well than the above program contact dt software freepost cambridge uk tel 0223 841099. portable software for almost any system if none of the above fit your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 6b also need a viewer program if your display be 8 bit or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 24-bit image file there be numerous commercial jpeg offering with more pop up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware-assisted product ask point question about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the early commercial release be not and never will be compatible with anyone else 's file 6b if you be look for source code to work with free portable c code for jpeg compression be available from the independent jpeg group which i lead a package contain our source code documentation and some small test file be available from several place the `` official '' archive site for this source code be ftp.uu.net 137.39.1.9 or

basis for jpeg-related product we do not ask a royalty although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature see the readme file in the distribution for detail we hope to make this software industrial-quality -- although a with anything free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group be a volunteer organization if like to contribute to improve our software you be welcome to join 7 what 's all this hoopla about color quantization most people have full-color 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 or few bit per pixel so it can display 256 or few distinct color at a time to display a full-color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color this process be call `` color quantization '' this be something of a misnomer `` color selection '' would be a well term stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy process it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by jpeg except at the very low jpeg quality setting since jpeg be a full-color format convert a color jpeg image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware require color quantization this be true for *all* color jpegs even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg what come out of the decompressor be *not* 256 color but thousand of color this happens because jpeg 's lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get `` smear '' into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be always require to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray-scale output incidentally because of this effect nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a jpeg image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference i occasionally see post image described a `` 256-color jpeg '' this tell me that the poster a read this faq and b probably convert the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classify a color or gray-scale just like photograph but number of color just a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition have already be quantize to 256 or few color a gif *does* have a definite number of color in it palette and the format allow more than 256 palette entry for purpose of usenet picture distribution gif have the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipient have to this be also the *disadvantage* of gif stuck with the sender's quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re-quantize result in much poorer image quality than if you have quantize once from a full-color image furthermore if the sender use a high-quality color quantization algorithm out of luck for this reason jpeg offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine match the sender 's display hardware jpeg 's full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user 's display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of jpeg image you already have with a gif stuck forevermore with what be sent also worth mention that many gif-viewing program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to this be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the gif one to display it but often also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be displayed thus jpeg be likely to provide well result than the average gif program for low-color-resolution display a well a high-resolution one finally an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already 15-bit `` hi-color '' pc display true 24-bit display on workstation and macintosh etc for these people gif be already obsolete a it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thus jpeg be an all-around well choice than gif for represent image in a machine-independent fashion 8 how do jpeg work the buzz-words to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy cod this article 's long enough already so not go to say more than that here for technical information see the comp.compression faq this be available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu in file /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part 1-3 if you need help in use the news.answers archive see the top of this article 9 what about lossless jpeg there 's a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantee the final output be bit-for-bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offer much less compression at present very few implementation of lossless jpeg exist and all of them be commercial say `` -q 100 '' to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossless image what it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v4 free jpeg code you can also say '' -sample 1x1 '' to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular jpeg algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image at this minimum-loss set regular jpeg produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image true lossless jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit-for-bit accuracy if you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than 6 bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs well than jpeg lossless on such image jpeg lossless be superior to jbig on image with 6 or more bit per pixel furthermore jpeg be public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig technique be heavily cover by patent 10 why all the argument about file format strictly speak jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithm it do *not* refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaf u with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to '' do their own thing '' and a a result their program compatible with anybody else 's the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format be some work be coordinate by people at c-cube microsystems they have define two jpeg-based file format jfif jpeg file interchange format a `` low-end '' format that transport pixel and not much else tiff/jpeg aka tiff 6.0 an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff be a `` high-end '' format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff be a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of tiff not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these format be developed with input from all the major vendor of jpeg-related product reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard i believe that usenet should adopt jfif a the replacement for gif in picture posting jfif be simpler than tiff and be available now the tiff 6.0 spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when tiff/jpeg be well define the jfif format be likely to be a widely support `` low common denominator '' tiff/jpeg file may never be a transportable a particular case that people may be interested in be apple 's quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime us a jfif-compatible format wrap inside the mac-specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg be pretty straightforward and several mac program be available to do it see mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for detail another particular case be handmade software 's program gif2jpg/jpg2gif and image alchemy these program be capable of reading and write jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format be not readable by any non-hsi program and should not be use for usenet posting use the -j switch to get jfif output this applies to old version of these program the current release emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi-format file unless you want to get flame by people on non-pc platform 11 how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an allege jpeg file that your software read likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file 1. a jfif-standard file will start with the character hex ff d8 ff e0 follow by two variable byte often hex 00 10 follow by 'jfif 2. if you see ff d8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a `` raw jpeg '' file this be probably decodable as-is by jfif software -- worth a try anyway 3. hsi file start with 'hsi1 out of luck unless you have hsi software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they decompress properly with non-hsi program 4. a macintosh pict file if jpeg-compressed will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a jfif header scan for 'jfif strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it 5. anything else a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8 try strip off everything before that in uuencoded usenet posting the characteristic jfif pattern be '' begin '' line m_ c_x ... whereas uuencoded hsi file will start with '' begin '' line m '-i ... if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non-jfif file 12 what about arithmetic cod the jpeg spec defines two different `` back end '' module for the final output of compress data either huffman cod or arithmetic cod be allow the choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic cod usually produce a small compress file on typical image arithmetic cod produce a file 5 or 10 percent small than huffman cod all the file-size number previously cite be for huffman cod unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic cod specify by the jpeg standard be subject to patent own by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus *you can not legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain license from these company the `` fair use '' doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic cod the space saving great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic cod *should not* be use for any image to be exchange on usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for far detail 13 do loss accumulate with repeat compression/decompression it would be nice if have compress an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any far image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately this be not the case in general recompressing an alter image loses more information though usually not a much a be lose the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without change it* then there be no far loss i.e. you get an identical jpeg file even this be not true at least not with the current free jpeg software essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first-generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on our to-do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limited but i be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compress the unmodified full-color output of djpeg at the original quality set would introduce no far loss even such simple change a crop off a border could cause far roundoff-error degradation if wonder why because the pixel-block boundary move if you cropped off only multiple of 16 pixel you might be safe but a mighty limited capability the bottom line be that jpeg be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you want to use it a an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way 14 what be some rule of thumb for convert gif image to jpeg a state earlier you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full-color data the gif be make from far well to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality the first rule when convert a gif library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary some gifs may be well left a gifs a explain in section 3 in particular cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or few color convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the gif so check the size too experience to date suggests that large high-visual-quality gifs be the best candidate for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to jpeg with least degradation waste your time convert any gif much under 100 kbytes also expect jpeg file convert from gifs to be a small a those create directly from full-color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be a much a twice a big a straight-through jpeg file would be i.e. shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file not 1/4th a suggest in earlier comparison many people have developed an odd habit of put a large constant-color border around a gif image while useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in gif file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact `` ghost '' edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you be on an x window system xv 's manual and automatic crop function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default q set of 75 be appropriate for full-color input but for gif input q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smooth a suggest below the high q set may not be necessary color gifs of photograph or complex artwork be usually `` dither '' to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different color at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to jpeg it look like high-spatial-frequency color noise and jpeg compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you have it to get around this you want to `` smooth '' the gif image before compression smooth average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process get rid of the rapid color change that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smooth will often let you avoid use a high q factor thus far reduce the size of the compress file while still obtain a better-looking output image than get without smooth with the v4 free jpeg software or product base on it a simple smooth capability be built in try `` -smooth 10 '' or so when convert gifs value of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs heavy-handed dither may require large smooth factor if you can see regular fine-scale pattern on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smooth be definitely call for too large a smooth factor will blur the output image which you want if you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filter program such a pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg 's built-in smoother be a lot faster than pnmconvol ... the upshot of all this be that `` cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 '' be probably a good start point for convert gifs but if you really care about the image want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- for more information about

b'our group recently bought a mitsubishi p78u video printer and i could use some help with it we bought this thing because it 1 have a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal input and 2 claimed to print 256 gray level image however the manual that come with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel image after some initial problem with the parallel interface i now have this thing run from a parallel port of an hewlett-packard workstation and i can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel image just fine i call the mitsubishi people and ask about the 256 level claim and they say that be only available when use with the video signal input this be not mention in the sale literature however they do say the p78u can do 6 bit/pixel 64 level image in parallel mode but they have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call japan etc frankly i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel image from the video source it store 8 bits/pixel in the memory not like memory be that expensive any more if anybody have any information on get 6 bit/pixel or even 8 bit/pixel image out of this thing i would greatly appreciate your send it to me thanks'

for ms-dos unix workstation among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platform by now i use the vms version the `` pci software '' consists of several classes/groups/packages of utility grouped by function but all operating on a common `` pci database '' disk file the `` tape i/o '' package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape format into or write those format out from the `` pci database '' file this be the only package i use or know much about other package can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci-supported third-party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attach printer e.g an epson-type dot-matrix graphic printer you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operation package histo- gram and fourier analysis equalization user-specified operation e.g `` multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store a channel 5 '' and god only know what all else -- there 's a lot i have and use these so say much about them you only buy the package your particular application/interest call for each utility be control by from one to eight `` parameter '' read from a common `` parameter file '' which must be in vms anyway in your `` default directory '' some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confuse set up a series of operation the standard pci environment contains a script language very similar to ibm-pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common complicate lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in vms i can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure there's also an optional program library which allows you to write compile language program which can interface with read from/write to the pci data structure database file parameter file the pci software be design specifically for remote-sensing image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r-s image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing a well for instance the tape i/o package offer a utility for reading headerless multi-band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh call `` raw '' data from tape in a number of different `` interleave '' order this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic-arts industry 's `` ct2t '' format would probably i try handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you 're do or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over worth note that the pci `` database '' file be design to contain not only `` raster '' image data but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land-use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral band latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pas all of this can go into the pci `` database '' i _believe_ that on workstation the built-in display be use on vax system other than workstation pci support only a couple of specific third-party display system the name gould/deanza seem to come to mind one of my personal workarounds be a display program which would display directly from a pci `` database '' file to a peritek vct-q q-bus 24-bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be `` overkill '' in your case it seem design for the very `` high end '' applications/users i.e those for whom a mac/pc largely suffice although a you know the gap be get small all the time probably no coincidence that pci be locate in canada a country which do a lot of it land/resource management via remote sense i believe the canadian government us pci software for some of it work in these area spam spectral analysis manager -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- back in 1985 jpl developed something call spam

b'this may be a fairly routine request on here but look for a fast polygon routine to be use in a 3d game i have one that work right now but it very slow could anyone point me to one pref in asm that be fairly well document and flexible thanx //lucas'
b"i think he want to avoid reinvent the wheel i would suggest that you take your code and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distribute include to the ftp site many folk myself include would enjoy the extra code just to clarify the 3d routine that be mention in various place on the mac be in a libray not the rom of the mac a few year ago before i knew anything about implement graphic i come across a demo of the apple grafsys3d library and it actually do a lot however it be quite limited in the sense that a low-level 3d library your code still have to plot individual point draw each line etc ad nauseum it have nothing on gl for example where you can handle object other thing to consider when talk about apple 's old 3d grafsys library unsupported never be and no plan exist to do so in the future undocumented unless you call header file documentation ... if one know something about graphic you could probably figure it out but assume there 's well software available that give well output and be at the same time programmatically nicer i.e easy to program just my 2 tax"

b'concern the propose newsgroup split i personally be not in favor of do this i learn an awful lot about all aspect of graphic by reading this group from code to hardware to algorithm i just think make 5 different group out of this be a wate and will only result in a few post a week per group i kind of like the convenience of have one big forum for discuss all aspect of graphic anyone else feel this way just curious daemon what he say ... --'

b"i be seek some alternate solution on how to turn a postscript type 1 or truetype font outline into polygon that can be subsequently scan convert by a 3d scanline renderer i have be study the problem of font conversion for a few year but have never have the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font render software so i would like to have some of my question answer before i jump into the deep end the main problem i face be how to use the even/odd or non-winding rule to turn the outline into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygon so there be no need to reduce the polygon to simple polygon for example in the letter `` o '' there be two outline 1 the outside outline which be clockwise truetype font 2 the inside outline which be counterclockwise one common solution use by a number of render package be to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outline be closest this be equivalent to descibing a `` polygon with hole '' the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edge be in the opposite direction to the outside edge i do not want to use this simplistic system since 1 it will not handle all outline font properly it be not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy font 2 it do not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rule from my research over the year the proper solution be to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outline into trapezoid a be do by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers these trapezoidal polygon can then be easily and properly render by the 3d scanline renderer my question be be there any well solution to turn the outline into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer i be not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygon another question for those in the know what be the best algorithm to create bevel and/or offset curve for font outline i have a dozen paper on these subject but i tell which method be the best to implement thanks for any pointer -- rob lansdale"
