b"admit a lot more than that you be admit that your moral be situational you be admit that the action of other people and the situation you be in help to determine how you judge the moral significance of one of your own action if you employ x degree of force not moral but if you employ x degree of force but previously someone else have employ y degree of force and the situation be thus-and-so that *is* moral this be quite different from say `` employ force on other people be immoral period unfortunately from time to time we be oblige to do this immoral thing for reason of self-preservation and so we have to bear the moral consequence of that for what worth and yes i know you claim to be an agnostic this ability to re-label thing from `` immoral '' to `` moral '' that i find one of the *least* attractive quality of the religious mind"
b'jesus also recognize other holy day like the passover act 15 say that no more should be layed on the gentile than that which be necessary the sabbath be not in the list nor do any of the epistle instruct people to keep the 7th day while christian be living among people who do not keep the 7th day it look like that would have be a problem instead we have scripture tell u that all day can be esteem alike roman 14:5 and that no man should judge u in regard to what kind of food we eat jewish holy day we keep or _in regard to the sabbath col 2 i think that the sabbath or any other command of the law be totally irrelevant to modern christian but what about collosions 2 where it say that we be not to be judged in regard to the keep of the sabbath'
b"in lsjc8cinnmc1 saltillo.cs.utexas.edu turpin cs.utexas.edu russell turpin i regard love a no more or less `` benign '' than any other christian do you be merely express `` approval '' of the consequence i find therein which say more about our politics and cultural trapping than about my or any religion `` love '' be a highly ambiguous word of which christian can write both the `` gentle '' word paul us of it in 1 corinthian -- in a passage that even the `` conservative '' will quote at you -- and the word of t. s. eliot in his pentacost hymn `` love be the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ... '' this be in any case rather to the side of what i be attempt to raise in my note a will become more evident below blechhh i think you be misread me rather seriously though give my principle that one can not force one 's own notion of `` sin '' on another and my unshakeable `` disestablishmentarianism '' russel turpin and others believer and unbeliever alike be under no threat of my legislate my own understand of christian love you misread i can do and have repeatedly do a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibit in a thorough a form a anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it have do to human being in the first place and to respect for let alone love of `` god '' in near succession please go back to my quote word above the `` possibility that always exists '' be that i or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessor over the last several century could persuade `` christian b '' of my case that the inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the law of love i must also note that the majority of christian have be so persuade by christian argumentation a well a by secular both christian and non-christian prohibition what mr. turpin alludes to be a trickier point a. i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involve in the inquisition b. the inquisitor responds that mother church must however painful this *seems* `` discipline '' her child for their own good -- in this case the salvation of their soul or if the torture heretic will not recant than by bad example `` deter '' others from the same loss-of-soul a. i point out that this `` justification '' of a failure in love depends on a highly speculative construal of text and of philosophical assertion that be quite undemonstrable b. burn me at the stake my rhetoric have fail but the point i be make be sustain what be go on here have a *lot* to do with `` cultural baggage '' in this case the baggage include a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accuse person must prove innocence and that testimony be most believable if take under torture the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those place where it *has* be eliminate or at least greatly reduce have very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between a and b. mr. turpin be point out that if i be a versus the grand inquisitor 's b then my persuasion be not very likely to work i know this and in what- ever personal agony i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney so `` one possibility '' fails in this case -- a it will fail in may others at the other extreme the `` persuasion '' will succeed when it properly should not if it entail mistaken assumption i share with the inquisitor and that be potentially an even more trouble case in that many of the victim of inquisition will have `` accepted '' that they be in fact sinful in such random case a they may actually have be guilty of charge brought against them the point be that the `` persuasion '' break down when the party do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and give the main thrust of the inquisition against `` heresy '' it be *bound* to break down in precisely the `` bad '' case the `` conservative '' i think that be the right word btw will take refuge in what i attribute to b above that he be `` justified '' in cause harm because he *thinks* that work to a `` great good '' but this be a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel a if one 's theory about `` sin '' entitle one to cast aside jesus word on deal with sinner cf matthew 5:39ff i be a `` radical '' christian *only* in that i take the gospel seriously well the whole *point* of make these the `` base '' commandment be that they ** reducible to rule a set of rule be a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act such thing can be very helpful to individual or society -- but not if they be use *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's action the great commandment be more than anything else a call to act *as if you be god and accept ultimate responsibility* in your every action a demand that i like most would rather *not* hear but it keep pop up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it be more important that i be open to try this than succeed at it `` conservative '' may twist this `` act a if you be god '' to mean `` lay down rule for other people and be a nasty to them a possible if they keep your rule '' they be so insistent and obvious about this that they have convince a lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy be how god act that after all be the standard accusation `` against god '' by the atheist here and elsewhere that the `` conservative '' have confuse their manipulative hoop-jumping notion of coerce other people with the nature of god be almost the entire content of standard american atheism -- and i quite agree with it on this point and different body of christian have from the begin urge *different* `` ethical system '' or in some case none a a result it be bizarre to identify any one of these system however popular or infamous with christianity christianity do not have a torah it do not have a qu'ran specifically christian scripture have very little if anything in the way of `` commandment '' -- so little that the `` christian '' who desperately *want* commandment go `` mining '' for them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their effort the one single thing in the gospel which jesus specifically `` give '' a `` a commandment '' to u be `` love one another '' i will be expand on this point in a reply to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it be quite true that some christian infer lot of commandment from the nt i'll point out what have to be go on in these inference and why there be a huge amount of `` cultural baggage '' involve you be quite right that this be `` goo '' if one be look for an ethical system but why should anyone be look for an ethical system since our society be eager to hand u one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical system -- in which case i will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again i think you be beg the question why i and the myriad of other christian like me tell you something about christianity nor be this very new in christianity -- you might want to look up the origin and fundamental doctrine of the quaker from the 17th century onwards and they be not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that be congenial to my case"

point be it not why do he wish to publish such thing about the history of his own organization do he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema or be he exercise his true will and put forth very complex picture with no easy answer a picture which leaf room for very many interpretation it be quite easy for me to see for example that all of o.t.o derive out of the dribble of falter masonry purchase by clever huckster with an ounce of courage and some write ability to aid them and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeble support of the 'law of thelema be laughable at best would i be thrown out of the order for speak in this way will i i think not why because my frater will see it a a perspective an interjection i be use a an example my illustration show that we may express thing in the context of a large work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first so it may be with oto and merlinus x please look o.t.o more carefully i do not support reuss 's word myself a i be not qualify to ass them and i be critical of their pomposity if i who be a member of the order take such a stand and be allow to continue do so then what can this say about the health of the order do it mean that the order have 'gone soft and abandon it moral principle or do it mean that it be strong in it ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on it own not shackle by some dogmatic requirement how shall we resolve these two possibility i find a high calibre of individual associate with ordo templi orientis they be often quite intelligent and sometimes very well verse in arcane or usual information they be quite often artist and genius have met some 20 longstanding member in the sf bay area many who be or be very heavily involve with the order i can vouch for the integrity of the organization a it stand i have sometimes question the policy of hymenaeus beta in these moment i follow my intuition and found little to

b"the divine master most christian would agree and correctly so that jesus christ be a divine master and a projection of god into the physical world god incarnate but there be some very important related fact that christian be completely ignorant of a be follower of most other world religion first jesus christ be not unique john 3:16 notwith- stand there be always at least one such divine master god incarnate physically alive in this world at all time a continuous succession throughout history both before and after the life of jesus the follower of some of these master found the world 's major religion usually pervert the teaching of their master in the process christian for example add threat of `` eternal damnation '' in hell and delete the teach of reincarnation secondly and more importantly after a particular master physically dy and leaf this world there be nothing that he can do for anybody except for the relatively few people that he initiate while he be still physically alive that be simply the way god set thing up in the universe therefore all those christian who worship jesus and pray to jesus and expect jesus to return and save them from their sin be only kid themselves and have allow themselves to be duped by a religion that be mostly manufacture by the roman and emotional `` feeling '' be a totally deceive indicator for religious validity these thing be similarly true for follower of most other major world religion include islam thirdly the primary function of each master be to tune his initiate into the `` audible life stream '' or `` sound current '' refer to a `` the word '' in john 1:1-5 and a `` the river of life '' in revelation 22:1 and to personally guide each of them thru the upper level of heaven while they be still connect to their living physical body by a `` silver cord '' true salvation which completes a soul 's cycle of reincarnation in the physical and psychic plane be achieve only by reach at least the `` soul plane '' which be five level or universe above the physical universe and this can not be do without the help of a physically-living divine master one such divine master alive today be an american sri harold klemp the living `` eck '' master or `` mahanta '' for the `` eckankar '' organization now headquarter in minneapolis p.o box 27300 zip 55427 another divine master be maharaj gurinder singh ji now living in punjab india and be associate with the `` sant mat '' organization one of the classic book on this subject be `` the path of the master '' radha soami book p.o box 242 gardena ca 90247 write in 1939 by dr. julian johnson a theologian and surgeon who spent the last year of his life in india study under and closely observe the sant mat master of that time maharaj sawan singh ji several of the eckankar book include some author by sri paul twitchell or sri harold klemp can be found in most public and university library and some book store or obtain thru inter-library loan the book `` eckankar -- the key to secret world '' by sri paul twitchell be another classic many christian be likely to confuse the master with the `` anti-christ '' which be or be to be a temporary world dictator during the so-called `` last day '' but the master ever rule even when ask or expect to do so a jesus be people who continue follow christianity islam or other orthodox religion with a physically-dead master will continue on their cycle of reincarnation between the psychic plane and this miserable physical world until they finally accept initiation from a physically-living divine master re-incarnation the book `` here and hereafter '' by ruth montgomery describes several kind of evidence support reincarnation a a fact of life include hypnotic regression to past life about 50 accurate the subconscious mind sometimes make thing up especially with a bad hypnotist spontaneous recall especially by young child some of whom can identify their most recent previous relative home possession etc dream recall of past life experi- ences deja vu familiarity with a far off land while travel- ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read- ings of the late edgar cayce and even support statement from the christian bible include matthew 17:11-13 john the baptist be the reincarnation of elia and john 9:1-2 how can a person possibly sin before he be born unless he live before always use the `` king james version '' later version be per-versions strong interest innate talent strong phobia etc. typically originate from a person 's past life for example a strong fear of swim in or travel over water usually result from have drown at the end of a previous life and sometimes a person will take an immediate dislike to another person be met for the first time in this life because of a bad encounter with him during a previous incarnation the teach of reincarnation also include the law of karma galatian 6:7 revelation 13:10 etc. people would behave much well toward each other if they knew that their action in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future or in a future incarnation `` 2nd coming '' if a divine master physically dy `` translates '' before a particular initiate of his do then when that initiate physically dy `` translates '' the master will meet him on the astral level and take him directly to the soul plane this be the one and only correct meaning of a 2nd come it be an individual experience not something that happens for everyone all at once people who be still wait for jesus `` 2nd come '' be wait in vain plane of existence the physical universe be the low of at least a dozen major level of existence above the physical plane be the astral plane the causal plane the mental plane the etheric plane often count a the upper part of the mental plane the soul plane and several high spiritual plane the soul plane be the first true heaven counting upward from the physical the plane between but not include the physical and soul plane be call the psychic plane it be likely that esp telepathy astrological influence radionic effect biological transmutation see the 1972 book with that title and other phenomenon without an apparent physical origin result from interaction between the psychic plane and the physical plane the major plane be also sub-divided for example a sub-plane of the astral plane be call `` hades '' and the christian hell occupies a small part of it create there less than 2000 year ago by the early catholic church by some kind of black magic or by simply teach it existence in a threaten manner the christian `` heaven '' be locate elsewhere on the astral plane good christian will go there for a short while and then reincarnate back to earth sound current vs. blind faith the christian religion demand of it follower an extraordinary amount of blind faith back up by little more than good feel which be totally deceive if a person be not hearing some form of the `` sound current '' `` the word '' `` the ban '' `` the audible life stream '' then his cycle of reincarnation in this miserable world will continue the `` sound current '' manifest differently for different initiate and can sound like a rush wind ocean wave on the sea shore buzzing bee higher-pitched buzzing sound a flute various heavenly music or other sound in eckankar member start hearing it near the end of their first year a a member this and other experience such a `` soul travel '' replace blind faith for more information answer to your question etc. please consult my cite source 3 book 2 address un-altered

b"i think that you be change the meaning of `` value '' here perhaps it be time to backtrack and take a look at the word value n. 1. a fair equivalent or return for something such a good or service 2. monetary or material worth 3. worth a measure in usefulness or importance merit 4. a principle standard or quality consider inherently worthwhile or desirable 5. precise meaning a of a word 6. an assign or calculate numerical quantity 7. mu the relative duratation of a tone or rest 8. the relative darkness or lightness of a color 9. the distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound in context of a moral system definition four seem to fit best in term of scientific usage definition six or eight might apply note that these definition do not mean the same thing in my mind to say that science have it basis in value be a bit of a reach science have it basis in observable fact even the usage of the word `` value '' above do not denote observable fact but rather a standard of measurement i would conclude that science do not have it basis in value and so your statement above fails in fact if one concludes that a scientific set of measurement value be base on system derive from observation then it must follow that in a scientific context there be no such thing a there be no such thing a '' objective value '' back to the present this have nothing to do with a moral system anyhow just because the word `` value '' be use in both context do not mean that there be a relationship between the two context if one be to argue for objective value in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrate that morality itself be objective consider the meaning of the word `` objective '' i doubt that this will ever happen so back to the original question and objective morality be ... .. if you can provide an objective foundation for `` morality '' then that will be a good begin"

'' of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage a he have do with juda death be to make it agree with another passage so that both could be consider correct '' my reply ... one of the reason i have give a different exegetical view of the passage be that you seem to think the majority of scholarship be wrong in conclude these passage be complimentary however i see no problem in tony rose's explanation of juda death ... _____________________________________________________________________ how would you explain the inaccuracy between juda hang himself in matthew 27:5 and `` fall headlong he burst open '' ============================================================= this question of the manner in which juda die be one with which we be constantly confront in our travel many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two account a an obvious irreconcilable error some have go so far a to say that the idea of an inerrant bible be destroyed by these contradictory account however this be not the case at all matthew relates that juda hang himself while peter tell u he fell and be crush by the impact the two statement be indeed different but do they necessarily contradict each other matthew do not say that juda do not fall neither do peter say that juda do not hang himself this be not a matter of one person call something black and the other person call it white both account can be true and supplementary a possible reconstruction would be this juda hang himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlook the valley of hinnom after he hung there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope give way and juda fell down the ledge mangle his body in the process the fall could have be before *or* after death a either would fit this explanation this possibility be entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom be examine from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terrace 25 to 40 foot in height and almost perpendicular there be still tree around the ledge and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that juda struck one of the jagged rock on this way down tear his body open it be important to remember that we be not told how long juda remain hang from the tree or how advanced be the decomposition of his body before his fall louis gaussen relates a story of a man who be determine to kill himself this individual place himself on the sill of a high window and point a pistol at his head he then pull the trigger and leap from the window at the same time on the other hand a person could say that this man take his life by shoot himself while another could rightly contend he commit suicide by jumping form the tall building in this case both be true a both be true in the case of matthew 's and peter 's account of the death of juda it be merely a situation of different perspective of the same event _____________________________________________________________________ your only reason for reject this be i believe your attempt to discredit inerrancy you related how this be impossible or highly unlikely here 's what you say in an earlier post ... _____________________________________________________________________ db quote tony rise ...

b"mr decenso in spite of require scholarly opinion on the hang of juda reject that the scholarly opinion of the those scholar and then rephrases those scholar opinion on the subject and actually if you do far research a to the greek word `` apacgw '' you will find that it do denote success those scholar do indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide be successful a i point out i recently checked several lexicon '' greek english lexicon of the new testament '' louw and nida '' robinson 's greek and english lexicon of the new testament '' '' greek english lexicon of the new testament '' grimm '' word study concordance '' tynsdale '' a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian writing '' bauer-arndt-gingrich '' the new analytical greek lexicon '' perschbacher a couple simply state `` hang oneself '' and a couple be more explicit and state that `` apacgw '' mean specifically `` kill yourself by hang '' a couple also note that the meaning of one the root word for `` apacgw '' be '' strangle throttle or choke '' which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggest to david joslin that juda be hung upside down one of the best reference though `` robinson 's greek and english lexicon of the new testament '' not only state the translation it give both the root word the literal translation related greek word which use the same root and also other present specific example of the word in greek literature to give far context the word `` apagchw '' have two root word `` gchw '' be the `` to strangle '' root and the root word `` apo '' mean literally `` away '' this root word be include in word which denote a transition it can mean a transition in place eg the greek word `` apagello '' mean to send a message `` apo '' can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death robinson specifically make comparison to the word `` apokteiuo '' which mean `` to kill '' in literal meaning the word `` apacgw '' mean `` to throttle strangle to put out of the way '' and implicitly denotes a change in life state ie away from life to death so while the word `` apacgw '' do mean `` to hang '' it specifically denotes a death a well thus robinson be quite specific when he state that it mean `` to hang oneself to end one 's life by hang '' he then note the the use of `` apacgw '' in homer odessy 19:230 to denote context he present that example of `` apacgw '' a be use to explicitly mean `` suicide by hang '' now since there be a perfectly good word for strangle without the add denotation of `` death '' and a you insist that the bible be write by god and every word be precicely correct you be stuck with the complete meaning of `` apacgw '' ie since the word `` apacgw '' be use then death be denote a the result by the way i note that mr decenso also present an example of `` apacgw '' note mr decenso a you say the septuagint be a translation from hebrew to greek and you have not show the original meaning of the hebrew ie '' the the hebrew say `` and die '' and thus whether it be simply echoed in the greek it should also be point out that regardless of the add `` and die '' the correct translation would still be `` apacgw '' a the man do indeed die from strangulation redundant but correct far we have evidence that the septuagint be repeatedly rewrite and reedited which include version which contradict each other and such edit be not even necessarily execute by greek thus i be not sure that you can use the septuagint a it now stand a a paragon of ancient greek so what you really need to prove your point mr decenso be an example in ancient greek of someone commit '' apacgw '' and survive otherwise i would see you a simply make worthless assertion without correspond evidence now i would note mr decenso that everytime i go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrive exegisis i pretty much find it false thus i think that if you be go to add to the text something over and above what the source clearly say then you have well have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it by the way a to mr rise 's statement about tree around the potter 's field unless mr rise can show that these tree be two thousand year old or that there be 2000 year old stump there or have a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mention such tree then it be inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of tree prove the location of the tree two thousand year ago after all thing change now a to your other argument ie that the money juda use be not the same a the 30 silver true peter or the author of act do not specifically call juda betrayal '' an iniquity '' but for that matter neither do john specifically call judas' action `` an iniquity '' either far john 13:29 do not say that juda take `` some thought that because juda have the money box jesus be tell him `` buy what we need for the feast '' or that he should give something to the poor so after receive the morsel he immediately go out and it be night '' note that it be say that juda left it do not say that he take the money box thus when i see your explanation it still seem to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity mention by another author in a different book write at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mention by the author of act i find this force and contrive of course this particular argument becomes moot since we have have see evidence that `` apacgw '' mean suicide you see since juda hang be successful he could not have spent the money mention in john 13:29 because matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal be on the high holy day ie passover and thus he could not have spent the money before kill himself the next day thus the money which bought the `` field of blood '' would have to have be the 30 piece of silver of course he get the 30 piece of silver that night a well and thus have spent that either oh dear i believe that the house of card be comming down maybe we should at this point discus now whether jesus be crucify on friday or saturday a that be now part of the argument about juda by the way a to where the prophesy of the potter 's field come from ie the mention of it in matthew you say i be remind you now to discus it now all part of the same verse we be discuss and i wish you would quit procrastinate and sidestep these issue later dave butler a wise man proportion his belief to the evidence david hume philosopher an inquiry concern human understand"

`` adopt '' into the house of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have express ra belief that this do evince a physical change in our body the mormon belief be that all be

told that `` and this be life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent '' ra john 17:3 life eternal be to know the only true god yet the ra doctrine of the lds that i have mention portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that can not be reconcile with the jesus of ra the bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim ra one a be true denies the other from be true accord to the ra bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination ra ra ra robert with all due respect who die and left you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation i mean to be snotty about this ra but the fact be that the bible be so differently interpret by different ra group of biblical scholar what do you think of the jehovah's ra witness for example that to make reference to the `` jesus of the ra bible '' be simply ridiculous whose `` jesus of the bible '' do you mean this be really a red herring it address any issue raise but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the bible change what the bible teach for example the fact that the jehovah 's witness deny the deity of christ do not alter what the bible teach `` look for that bless hope and the glorious appear of the great god and our saviour jesus christ '' titus 2:13 '' simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtain like precious faith with u through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ '' 2 peter 1:1 on the deity of christ we first look to the bible to see what it teach to discount or not even address what the bible teach because there be some group that have differ view be self-defeating to see what the bible teach you have to look at the bible ra `` our lord 's mortality be essential to his own salvation '' _the ra promise messiah_ p. 456 `` he have to work out his own salvation by ra do the will of the father in all thing '' ibid. p.54 `` he have ra to be baptize to gain admission to the celestial kingdom '' _mormon ra doctrine_ p.71 ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert the ra above book be by the late bruce r. mcconkie a former general authority ra of the lds church those book be not publish by the church nor do ra they constitute `` offical doctrine '' they consist of his opinion now ra do that mean that what he say be not true not at all i 'll have to ra think about the idea of christ 's personal salvation before i come to any ra conclusion myself the conclusion i come to may seem `` heretical '' to ra you but prepared to accept that i find this rather curious when i mention that the mormon belief be that jesus need to be save i put forward some quote from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part be that no one address the issue of jesus need to be save rick come the closest with his `` i have my own conclusion '' to address the point most of the other reply have instead hop-scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his view be 'official doctrine i think that it matter if mcconkie 's view be canon that be not the issue be mcconkie 's writing indicative of mormon belief on this subject be the real issue the indication from rick be that they may certainly be"

b"actually jon that be quite true christian people have cause '' objective morality '' to look very `` relative '' after all that be the point of the original question in this thread i.e can we toss out christianity because it be so obviously inconsistent with it own principle if you will bear with me i will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one christian 's viewpoint if god exists and be the creator of mankind a the bible claim then he have a pretty well-defined concept of what make people tick physically emotionally etc god have an `` objective '' morality for u that be to say he have no trouble understand what be good for or detrimental to the creature he create galatian 2:10 -- for we mankind be his workmanship create in christ jesus for good work a morality which god prepared beforehand a well-defined design that we might walk in them however contrary to what many people assume include the pharasees of the bible god 's morality can not be completely codify in a list of rule and regulation to some extent every activity of a person 's life creates a new situation to which morality must be apply there never could be enough volume to codify god's '' objective '' morality for u throughout history mankind have try to reduce morality to a list of rule objectivity if you please in the old testament we have both principle and specific rule by the time of jesus most of the principle be obscure by the emphasis men have place on the rule volume of additional rule have be make to try to codify the application of the principle we mankind comfortable with the `` subjectivity '' of principle for reference see matthew 5 where jesus explains the difference between the law and the principle of the law for example in verse 21-22 `` you have heard that the ancient be told 'you shall not commit murder ... and 'whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court but i say to you that everyone who be angry with his brother shall be liable to the court ... '' the `` objective morality '' of god get blur by our inept interpretation of it we christian have make our big error when we have allow any one person or group of people decide exactly what god intend for u if we christian would stay commit to seek god 's will instead of try to prove we already have it all figure out we might do a well job of allow others to find god's '' objective morality '' for themselves if jesus be who he say he was/is and the fundamental question then he be `` objective morality ''"

b"stop hold it you have a few problem here official history say that the first accusation of homosexuality in the sa come from outside of the nazi party long before the nazi ever come to power so this objection be a red herring even if establish history be wrong on this point moreover none of the history read ever make mention of hitler or anyone else ever use homosexuality a a pretext for purge roehm a point i saw reiterate be that hitler and the party cover up these accusation if you be go to accuse official history of be a fabrication you should at least get your fact right the pretext for purge roehm be that he be planning to use the sa in a coup against hitler nowhere be there mention of use allegation of homosexuality a a pretext for the purge nor a a justification afterwards it be possible that the history read have not mention this but i doubt it would it be in hitler 's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man be a homosexual anyway a i say before it be always possible that i have miss reference to the nazi make use of charge of homosexuality against the sa after the night of the long knife but this do not prove that they be false even the nazi could tell the truth when it be to their advantage in any case this do not deal with accusation of homosexuality in the sa during the 1920 's ah yes i forgot this be be post to alt.conspiracy i can smell the paranoia from here since the nazi never officially charge roehm with homosexuality at least not accord to what read like to know what taint `` evidence '' you be talk about since the accusation be make by person outside of the nazi party long before it come to power and those accusation be common knowledge to journalist and others in germany in the 1920 's and 30 's just how would it be possible for the nazi to go back in time and plant `` taint '' evidence how exactly do one doctor newspaper which be circulate around the world without the discrepancy be obvious what actual incidence of nazi doctor evidence on this matter do you know about and what about the testimony of people who be involve in these matter some of whom be not nazi and what be the point of make a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it since the point here seem to be to discredit establish history then the burden of proof fall on the revisionist the revisionist have well do their homework before make accusation otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nut this be just about the *only* thing we agree on i suspect that the notion that there might have be bad people roehm and his sa buddy who be homosexual must disturb some people the feel seem to be that if a nasty individual be accuse of homosexuality that this must be an attempt to bash homosexual this fear often justified be what lie behind this distrust of official history or so it seem to me but this be not a good justification for trash accepted account of this subject if you really think that historian be so incompetent why you write them and ask where they get their source on this subject if you tell from their footnote a graduate student in history write to professor and track down source be old hat but my time be limited and this be not my specialty and neither you nor anyone else have say anything that would cast one shred of doubt on exist evidence not go to waste my time try to debunk someone 's paranoia do the research yourself give that you already consider all evidence `` taint '' what on earth would constitute concrete particular and since when have concrete particular be consider `` shrewd guess '' i suggest that those who do not trust popular historian irving et al historian write for a popular audience do not a a rule provide copious footnote should try instead reading academic historian who usually provide footnote to all their source in immmense detail this be the place to start look assume that one really want to know the truth i 'll bet the folk on alt.pagan be tire of this subject already my apology we seem to have go off on a bit of a tangent i forget which god be responsible for keep string within appropriate newsgroup subject boundary ..."

be that neither you nor i can fully speak for anyone who call themself gay but know a many a i do and know their testimony and witness thier faith and life i have to say that the report you post be a

and i have read several other article of former leader and founder of 'ex-gay ministry who have say very similar th similar thing fortuantely not all of them have left christianity but have come to realize that god love them despite the attitude of others some like chris glaser director of the presbyterian `` lazarus project '' of west hollywood presbyterian church have actually be work with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encourage real ethical value of sexuality within the sphere of be gay i have also a i say talk and become and become close friend with many who once attend such group a `` love in action '' and others who either once claimed to have be `` reform '' or who be too honest with themselves to live a lie no matter who be disappointed in them some be even encourage to marry a a way of `` seal '' their new heterosexuality only to eventually start hit the bar bathhouse and bookstore since these be usually activity under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous `` sin '' through a commit relationship this be a horrible trap which the church have dumped on the back of the truly gay orient people and the very inno- cent victim in these case be the wife and child of such marriage yet the church insists that there be only two option they be willing to allow gay people 1 heterosexuality or 2 celebacy this be sad what be also mrtifying be in the case of those who can not suppress their desire and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church force on them they may even opt for 'suicide or surgical dampering of the brain function in the past lobotomy and heavey drug suppressant be common- place there be now become available more and more literature on the threat of coercive christianity toward gay such a sylvia pennington's '' ex-gays there be none_ and others there be also a great many fact base book be write to help people trap in this confusion such a

b"there have be a lot of discussion about tyre in sum ezekiel prophesy that the place would be mash and never rebuilt a there be a lot of people living there it would appear that ezekiel be not literally correct this bother me at all because i understand the language ezekiel use differently than do so-called biblical literalists for example it sometimes happens that someone say `` my grandson be the cutest baby '' and then turn around and see the granddaughter and say `` oh she the cutest thing '' this person be not literally claim to have line up all the baby in the world accord to cuteness and discover his own grandchild tie for first rather he be try to express his emotion use word that be very object-oriented because this example be one that be common to many people nobody misunderstands the intent of the statement the bible however be often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true for those people the existence of tyre be a problem for me it be not turn to the late person try to defend ezekiel we read this from john e king no it implies nothing of the kind if you have nothing but the prophecy from ezekiel and you be told you interpret it literally you would never say '' oh he mean that there will be house and business and plant and stuff like that '' you would read `` i will make you a bare rock '' and `` you will never be rebuilt '' and conclude that tyre would be a bare rock the only way to get from fishing net to house and building and a medium-large population be if you know that all that latter stuff be there in other word your answer mean that ezekiel mislead everybody who read the prophecy at the time it be write there be no way that give a literal reading they could read this passage and conclude `` medium-size city '' you seem to feel that `` never be rebuilt '' mean `` be rebuilt '' -- maybe so but it be hardly a clear implication well no only a bit less than the population of annapolis where from you know the naval acadamy the state capital george washington resign his commission in the statehouse annapolis may not be new york but at least a two-horse town but suppose 22,000 people be a `` small town '' -- still 22,000 people more than ezekiel predict and say nothing about the other problem in chapter 26 ezekiel predicts that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all their valuable however nebuchadnezzar do not destroy tyre and in chapter 29 ezekiel even quote god a say `` he and his army get no reward from the campaign he lead against tyre '' let 's ignore alexander for a moment and just pay attention to chapter 26. ezekiel say n. would destroy tyre and n. do not destroy tyre ezekiel say that n. would plunder their valuable but n. do not plunder their valuable regardless of what you think about tyre _now_ the fact be that n. die before the place be destroyed ezekiel say n. be go to do it and n. do not this post be of course pointless inerrantists have an amaze ability to rewrite the bible a need to fit whatever they want it to say for example i expect mr king to respond to the comment about ezekiel 26 by pull some `` clear implication '' out of hat when ezekiel say that n. would `` demolish your tower '' that clearly imply that the wall would still be stand so people would know where the tower use to be and when ezekiel say that n. would `` demolish your fine house and throw your stone timber and rubble into the sea '' that clearly imply that n. would never set foot on the island and when ezekiel write that n. would `` build a ramp up to your wall '' that clearly implies that n. would spend 13 year stomp around on the mainland and never get close to the wall see a few `` clear implication '' that be totally contrary to the text and you can reconcile anything you want"

same a jew lead to understand make no mistake this be no messiah talk about in smith the and neither do he claim he be a the church reflect the moral aptitude of it leader and especially those of joseph smith i have nothing but the high respect for this inspire man whose only `` crime '' be that he refuse to deny that he have see a vision ... many have try to explain the `` smith phenomenon '' away but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stand a a witness that joseph smith's testimony have enough resilience and power to carry on the message thought at the time be that the gift of prophecy be to be hand down father to son after joseph smith die his son be only enter his teen brigham young and a few others claimed to have be bequeath the gift and leadership prior to his death the council of twelve the church govern body of much help here and this basic conflict be still a wedge between the sect brigham young take his follower to salt lake the rest wait for smith jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership the other claimant to the leadership be soon ignore like mike dukakis '' the rest '' be apostate and excommunicate member of the church while the great majority of the membership the twelve and the various auxiliary organization chose to accept brigham young a the new prophet and leader of the church if you knew your lds scripture and doctrine you would have know that brigham young be the first in line to fill the prophet joseph smith 's vacancy he be the senior apostle in the quorum and various comment make by joseph indicate that it be brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the west other rightful `` heir '' be either dead hyrum smith or excommunicate oliver cowdery and while persecution abound and intensified joseph smith have already give order to look for a new place an empty land beyond the boundary of the united state at that time this '' rekhabite '' principle pseudographia be well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful and be not question by them grant a couple of `` do-it-yourselfers '' stayed behind unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown but this also be necessary to separate the tare from the wheat the church benefit from this purification process they become even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world both sect practice the `` 1-year food stockpile '' doctrine and this be frontier and farm country most carry or at least own weapon there be little evidence that they be a militaristic sect give that they tend to move on rather than face large-scale opposition brigham young have suffer a great deal get to salt lake seem to have be quite justified in make military training a good thing remember this be far beyond where even the u army go and these people have nobody to turn to save themselves just a little context to put this all in perspective btw since when be the church of jesus christ of latter-day saint one of the large denomination in the country a `` sect '' it `` splinter '' from any other religion a do say the southern baptist or methodist so what do the mormon get it seem that j. edgar hoover be very impressed with the way they kept secret pledge to defend secret with their life and atone for sin with blood many actually do even to the point of suicide what a balloney suicide be sinful and against the law of god i be not comfortable with this allege `` cosiness '' with mammon i assure you that *many* among u reject this attitude categorically period our only true allegiance be to our god and to the leader which he have appoint to represent him in any regard to read this trash about suicide and `` atone for sin with blood '' be yet another insult misrepresentation of what my church believe in and stand for ... the rlds the reorganize lds be friendly rival of the lds and delight in tell story about them which generates quick retort from the lds member and everybody have a grand time at no time have i ever even heard this hint at take it with a salt block make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top so he hire virtually no one but mormon until the fbi be almost exclusively staffed by member of the church of later day saint though j. edgar be finally go the fbi personnel especially the field agent be still heavily mormon i have often wonder how this might affect the fbi 's treatment of religious organization a mormon would consider heretical preposterous even if this be true reliable data please i be convince that those officer would perform to the high code of honor and conduct why they be select for in the first place remember besides one of our article of faith strongly state the principle of freedom of religion and that all people be free to worship `` *how* *where* or *what* they may '' if true there would be little affect lds and rlds philosophy be that all other religion have strayed from the true church a set down by jesus but that god will judge each on his own merit in addition the rlds also contend and the lds may a well that ignorance of the true way tm be an excuse you can only be condemn if you have be tought the way and reject it in short lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutheran to buddhist secure in the knowledge that though they be wrong they will not be penalize for ignorance it be more likely that hoover like them because of their rather strict upbringing which forbade alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like these people be the `` salt of the earth '' and a such be more easily make to follow order and have few vice to be use against them a good explanation i can accept that you be right that lds people be sometimes a little too cosy with mammon 's `` order '' the late president kimball for example be an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the mx `` peace keeper '' missile maze in utah my somewhat educate guess anyway both sect have splinter group that

b"let me begin by say i think this be the world 's first religion to use the net a it major recruitment medium therefore even if this religion do not take off it found member will be very important historically a this method of solicit membership will eventually become common the basis of this religion be to apply various aspect of current conventional morality to the character in genesis and exodus but assume that the bible's account of the fact and historical event be correct for example story of adam and eve adam and eve be in garden of eden naked and ignorant have unlimited supply of food provide but no clothing job or knowledge god say not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge they do anyway then try to hide in bush god find them and force them out of garden there be several different story on what they be do while naked in the bush that might have angered god traditional philosophy 1. the only reason you need knowledge or a job be to eat if someone else will provide you with food then you can be stupid and unemployed and ok. this be why married woman usually work until recent decade 2. authority figure such a god whoever be behind the vietnam war hitler and slaveowners be always right and should be blindly follow without question by ordinary people who make decision for themselves interpretation of event base on traditional philosophy they be not suppose to eat the fruit they should have do whatever god told them to like small child they have their need provide for and be obligate to do whatever their `` father '' say to be force to leave the garden and work in order to obtain food be a punishment lesson from traditional interpretation 1. ignorance be good knowledge be bad but tempt 2. have food provide for you for nothing read `` welfare '' be ideal get- ting a job and feed yourself with what you earn be punishment 3. public nudity be good cover up be bad 4. authority figure be intrinsically right normal people be dumb and should do whatever they be told without question they should not think for themselves 5. people in subordinate position be especially obligate to refrain from learn for example it should be illegal for slave to learn to read 1990 's philosophy 1. people should seek education and employment outside the home unless name `` hillary clinton '' or `` murphy brown '' 2. people should use common sense they should not kill other people binding of issac war holocaust etc just because they be told to interpretation of event base on current philosophy they be suppose to eat the fruit god give want them to seek knowledge rather than be hand it on a silver platter once they have gain knowledge and by seek it show their ability to make mature decision for them- self they no longer need to be treat like little child and be reward by be allow into the `` real world '' lesson from new interpretation 1. ignorance be bad knowledge be good but must be sought 2. have food provide for you for nothing read `` welfare '' be at best a temporary measure get a job and feed yourself with what you earn be ideal 3. public nudity be bad cover up be good 4. authority figure be often wrong normal people be intelligent and should consider whether the instruction be really a good idea and `` alter or abolish '' bad government they should think for themselves 5. people in subordinate decision be often discourage from knowledge but should seek it anyway and all the harder for example poor child without good school should work especially hard in order to make a well life for their child and themselves i have tentatively name this new philosophy `` the church of eveism '' because eve 's decision to eat the apple be man sic kind 's first good decision instead of it first bad one a traditionally believe she be therefore clearly a protagonist god at first appear evil for tell people not to seek knowledge but on deeper analysis be also a protagonist a god reward the decision to defy him and provide the tree in the first place the intention and desire be clearly to have the knowledge be obtain but to delay it until it be actively sought -- -end serious discussion begin humor. -- save this post to disk or file server someday it will be consider the most important write since the 10 commandment you want an original copy stay tune for the rfd on soc.religion.eveism ... can i get a tax deduction for money i donate to this organization -- return to serious discussion when post follow-ups. --"
b"rick anderson reply to my letter with ... ra in article c5elp2.l0c acsu.buffalo.edu ra ... just briefly on something that you mention in passing you refer to differ interpretation of `` create '' and say that many christian may not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line be truth regardless of popularity of opinion it may be `` irrelevant '' to you and *your* personal belief or should i say '' bias '' but it be relevant to me and many others right `` the bottom line be truth '' independant from you or anyone else since you proclaim `` truth '' a a self-proclaimed appointee may i ask you by what authority you do this because `` it say so in the bible '' -- do the bible `` say so '' or be it you or someone else who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular like or `` disapproval '' excuse moi but your line of `` truth '' move me one bit to persuade me that my belief be erroneous of all the `` preacher '' of `` truth '' on this net you have struck me a a self-righteous member of the wreck crew with no positive message to me or other latter-day saint whatsoever btw this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the thing say by jesus to the pharisee `` ye hypocrite s ye preach about me with your lip but your heart be far remove from me ... '' also i find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create and eternally existent be equivalent you say `` grant the mormon belief ... '' you grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that be raise and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant sophistry look who 's talk `` jumping to conclusion '' you do that yourself right all you address be your own conviction regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of view because you reject such interpretation without any consideration whatsoever the bible state that lucifer be create the bible state that jesus be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the lds belief be that jesus and lucifer be the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine the former kgb would have love to employ you jesus and lucifer be not `` the same '' silly and you know it ... the mormon belief be that all be child of god literally there be nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible say the bible teach that not everyone be a child of god correction it may contradict would you think the bible say the bible indeed do teach that not all be child of god in the sense that they '' belong to '' or follow god in his footstep satan and his follower have rebel against god and be not `` child =followers/redeemed of god '' but it mean that they be not once create by god but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of salvation the field be the world the good seed be the child of the kingdom but the tare be the child of the wicked `` one '' matthew 13:38 kingdom be those who have remain valiant in their testimony of jesus and have show `` work of repentance etc and the child of the wicked one be those who rebel against god and the lamb the issue of satan 's spirit-offspring and those who follow him have not be address in this and other verse you copy from your bible you purposefully obscure the subject by swamp your `` right '' with non- related scripture ... lot of nice scripture delete not robert w. copyright though ... ra we be told that `` and this be life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent '' ra john 17:3 life eternal be to know the only true god yet the ra doctrine of the lds that i have mention portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that can not be reconcile with the jesus of ra the bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim correction `` my '' jesus be indeed different than your jesus and can be reconcile with the jesus in the bible -- not your interpretation of him i concur but i honestly care less ra one a be true denies the other from be true accord to the ra bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination in this single post of yours see more `` construct of imagination '' than in all of the pro-lds mail combine i have read so far in this news group first get your lds-facts straight before you dare preach to u about `` the only true god '' whom you interpret accord to your own like and dislike but whose image i can not reconcile with what i know about him myself i guess your grandiose self-image do not allow for other faith believe in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different way or fashion than your own not that it really matter the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progress until it have visit every continent swept every clime and sound in every ear this be really a red herring it address any issue raise but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the bible change what the bible teach sigh `` what the bible teach '' or `` what the bible teach accord to robert wei and co.

b'and i maintain some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone be their own master because they fear it they be too afraid of have to face the world on their own term and so by their own choice they will remain in darkness sort of like bug under a rock however some people but not many will not like the darkness sometimes it get too cold and too dark to be comfortable these people will crawl out from under the rock and although blind at first will get accustom to the light and enjoy it warmth and after a while now that they can see thing for what they really be they will also see the height which they can reach and the place they can go and they will learn to choose their own path through the world and they will learn from their mistake and revel in their success they will see that there be much much more to the world than just the narrow experience under the rock they will discover that life under a rock be incredibly yucky and that life on their own term be great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it do you see my point i think the one under the rock and get a great tan out here in the sunlight my life have improve immesurably since i abandon theism -- come and join me it will be a difficult trip at first until you build up your muscle for the long hike but well worth it look you just practically equate odin and zeus a much different a your god be from them ... you see not go to accept anything that i witness with my own eye or experience with my own sens especially not something a mega-powerful a what try to get me to accept surely if you believe in it this strongly you must have a good *reason* to you when do i say that i say that i would rather cease exist instead of be subject to the whim of a deity but that if the deity decide to toss me into the fiery pit because of who i be then so be it nope -- most people be christian most people be fond of feel that they be imperfect of believe that the world be an undesirable place of recite magical mystical prayer to make the world nice and holy again of do just a their priest tell them like good little sheep you enjoy darkness and proud of it you may know the bible well -- but have you read any of the koran or zen writing or hare krishna literature if you then how can you say you have an open mind nope you make decision enjoy your success and accept your failure then you die if you be content with the life lead a you reflect back on it in your final moment then lead a good life please do sorry i feel that sacrifice jesus be something any god worship would do unless the sacrifice be only temporary in which case not really all that important forget the bible for a minute forget quote verse forget about who say what about this or that *show me picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop and convince me that right'
b"no matter how `` absurd '' it be to suggest that a common moral system create by mankind be absolute it be not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system create by mankind be sensible in fact for the bible to be of any use to mankind a a moral code it must be interpret by mankind and a workable moral system create for everyday use the jewish talmud be the result of century of biblical scholar analyse every word of the torah to understand the morality behind it the child of israel be give a very strict set of moral civil judicial and ceremonial law to follow and yet this be clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their society for a christian the situation be no well it seem to me that the only code of morality that we have from the judeo- christian god be that which be contain in the bible which we can see from the diverse opinion in the christian newsgroups be not clear there may well be an absolute morality define by the judeo-christian god for mankind to follow but it seem that we only have a subset simply because the concept be write down by man this lead to the problem of define morality for our society if we take the divine morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpret in many different way a an example consider the immolation of heretic in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer justice if we take an agnostic morality then we have a code of practice that can be modify to suit society with all the danger that this implies alternatively we could take the basis of the judeo-christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suit the society we live in and enables the people to live righteously a many christian and non-christian philosopher have do whatever the drive force behind the definition of morality for our society i think the important aspect be the result david -- on religion"
b"yep pretty much it not a jew but i understand that this be the jewish way of think however the jew believe that the covenant between yhwh and the patriarch abraham and moses in this case establishes a moral code to follow for mankind even the jew could not decide where the boundary fall though a i understand it the sadducee believe that the torah be all that be require whereas the pharisee the ancestor of modern judaism believe that the torah be available for interpretation to lead to an understand of the require morality in all it nuance talmud the essence of all of this be that biblical morality be an interface between man and yhwh for a jew or christian and do not necessarily indicate anything about yhwh outside of that relationship although one can speculate the trouble with all of this be that we really know what the `` create in his image '' mean heard a number of different opinion on this and have still not come to any conclusion this rather upset the apple cart if one want to base a life script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphor unashamedly a to living by christ 's example we know very little about jesus a a person we only have his record utterance in a set of narrative by his follower and some very small reference from comtemporary historian revelation aside one can only `` know '' christ second-hand or bad this be not an attempt to debunk christianity although it may seem that way initially the point i m try to make be that we only really have the bible to interpret and that interpretation be by humanity i guess this be where faith or relevation come in with all it inherent subjectiveness no there may be an absolute moral code there be undoubtably multiple moral code the multiple moral code may be found in the absolute moral code a an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent have told the child that it be `` wrong '' now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there be no child the `` wrongness '' here be if the child disobeys the parent the parent may feel that it be `` inappropriate '' to swear in front of child but may be quite happy to swear in front of animal the analogy do not quite hold water because the child know that he be of the same type a the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it incidentally the young child considers the directive a absolute until he get old see piaget and learns a morality of his own david -- on religion"

b"seriously though griffen save the life of child and he do destroy the life of a man so on the most superficial of level scum i almost agree but griffen be not scum scum have no guilt or freedom to choose anything griffen do god do not make scum when he make griffen he make a precious person and this person chose to do wrong the same go for dr. gunn but if you be to examine it more closely griffen would have prefer that these child be born -- yet after their birth do griffen have any assistance to offer them do griffen intend to support them educate them raise them up to be useful citizen do he have any intent whatsoever to help these child after birth here 's the real problem american have become so insensitive to the need of others and so completely wrap up in themselves that they can not see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decision base on reality if a man abandon a woman to care for their child on her own he be not consider to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone this man have flee his responsibility have behave like a lazy coward and have turn away from his responsibility to his wife and child however if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden she be not thought of in the same way when the man abandon the woman suffers but the child be free to grow up and live a happy and normal life when the woman abandon the child be dice or kill with saline or vacuumed out and the man have no choice and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wish he could trade place with his child th root of this whole problem be selfishness -- the arrogance that say `` my feeling and desire be supreme and your well be be not worth dung '' and when you come down to it this be the substance of what hell be make of the reason a love god can throw selfish people to the devil and his demon for all of eternity let any one of u unrepentant into heaven and ruin it the first chance we get now i really know the answer to these question but get a real good guess and probably right and i call *that* 'benevolent either it be a move in the right direction a it be now we see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight the medium back u completely real responsibility do not sell the only '' responsibility '' that sell in the marketplace be that which be just enough to make u `` feel responsible '' without show anything that might show u our own true irresponsibility we want to `` feel '' like good people but we want nothing with *being* good people just give me the freedom to say `` good '' and the rest of the world can burn rape and kill my child and throw my parent to the place where poor old folk rot until dead i 'll hate my brother and sister if i wish and i 'll cheat on my wife or husband screw the government because it screw me and talk to me about give to the church because church people be all a bunch of money grub hypocrite but a good person at least i admit what i do at least i love myself and we all know that be the great love in the world -- not that a man lay down his life for his brother ... that sound too `` christian '' at the root this be the substance of what hell be make of become a self indulgant backslidden society no longer responsible to our child to our parent to our family to our government or to our god this be the root behind justification of every evil of every corruption in government of every slanderous remark of every lie and of every murder society can not continue to live like this long it will have to destroy itsself soon and perhaps in the end that will be the big blessing this world can hope to see why do people see so much evil in try to turn this situation around -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- '' i deplore the horrible crime of child murder ... we want prevention not merely punishment we must reach the root of the evil ... it be practice by those whose inmost soul revolt from the dreadful deed ... no mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffer the unborn innocent the woman be awfully guilty who commits the deed ... but oh thrice guilty be he who drove her to the desperation which impel her to the crime ''"

his miracle but only call them -hasha wa kella allah forbids sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive their follower the miracle of muhammad saw have the certainty of confirmation by

evidence of the veracity of this high be and the proof of his prophethood be not restrict to his miracle all his deed and act his word and behavior his moral conduct and manner his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness indeed many people such a abdullah b. salam the famous scholar of the child of israel come to belief merely by see him and say 'no lie can hide in this face nor can any fraud be found in it although many of the researcher have conclude that the proof of the prophethood of muhammad and his miracle number about one thousand there be thousand perhaps hundred of thousand of proof of his prophethood and hundred of thousand of truth-seeking men muhakkikiin with vary opinion have affirm his prophethood in an equal number of way the wise our'an alone demonstrates thousand of the proof of his prophethood in addition to it own forty aspect of miraculousness since prophethood be a a phenomenon of humanity and hundred of thousand of individual who claimed prophethood and perform miracle have live and pass away then the prophethood of muhammad saw be of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others for whatever evidence quality and attribute become the mean of the prophethood and messengership of all the messenger such a jesus a and moses a they be all own in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by

b"superficially a good answer but it that simple an awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world be directly cause by the economic policy of the western country a well a by the diet of the typical westerner for instance some third-world country with terrible malnutrition problem export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the u to make tender juicy steak and burger they have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the cripple bank loan we encourage them to take out fund-raising for ethiopia be a truly bizarre idea instead we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they 've get perhaps more accurate to say that there 's a western ethic against western infanticide all the evidence suggests that so long a the child be die in the third world we give a shit and that go for the suppose `` pro-life '' movement too they could save far more life by fight against third world debt than they will by fight against abortion hell if only interested in fetus they could save more of those by fight for human right in china and besides suzanne 's answer implies that non-western country lack this ethic against infanticide apart from china with it policy of mandatory force abortion in tibet i believe this to be the case"

b"tony- i read your post it be nothing new i have see much the same in other typical '' christian '' anti-gay sentimental literature gay people be and will con- tinue to be persecute a long a such propaganda petpetuates you may be unaware of all the statistica `` finding '' concern african-american that have be publish and use by various group to re-enforce their own bias against african-american we usually think of the kkk in these instance but there be many other group of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such finding and document today but that be not always the case fortunately african-american have `` white '' who support their 'cause and public sentiment be eventually if not entirely turn around there be even a civil war and anti-negro sentiment increase in fact until law be put in place to protect the inalienable right of black it be pretty much legal to discriminate against them i know many gay and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination you may think that i have be deceive or something that be your perogative my church christian church disciple of christ openly affirms the right of oppress people of all segment of society include gay we believe the gospel message of preach to all creation and make disciple we believe in the lord 's great commandment to love and we beleive in stand up for the oppress even if it be not popular to do so i really like my church for last reason the most i can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stand for the gospel and believe in the commandment of love though hard-pressed to find many who actually sho love but not many be willing to champion the oppress especially within their own community i may have lose face with the great christian community for the unpopularity of my belief but so do the abolitionist against the oppression of african-american many be even kill and treat a runaway slave for be `` nigger-lovers '' and such i guess decide the challenge be worth it in my talk with gay men and woman i have heard tragic story after tragic story center around fail marriage wife and husband who be straight who have be hurt in the process etc funny thing be i know of one case where the parent ex-wives or even child have continued to reject their gay family member son daughter ex-husband father etc after they begin to take part in some form of support group like pflag apalled by the legislation which pass in colorado and be equally out0 rag that such slimey people a louis sheldon from the tradition value coalition have be actively work in the christian underground to garner support within several 8 i believe state this come november for more oppressive legisation against gay perhaps you get it and maybe you never will many get it in the middle age and the proclaim god 's will be do a they massacre thousand in witch hunt and inquisition the message that come through loud and clear by proponent against gay right and against gay in general be that there be a strong dislike even hatred for gay whether you want to call it such or not it change the result the major flaw in all this posturing be that in the end the final effect of post like that of yours and mr. hudson be that you have a '' conditional '' love for gay condition change and love you this be sure strange come from a group who claim that god have an `` unconditional '' love one that call people `` just a they be '' sure there be thing that will 'naturally change and habit like alcoholism wife beating etc that need to be change through some sort of therapy but then there be thing like left-handedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people be go to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to `` other people 's expectation '' in the process this coerce conformity cause many people a great deal of harm especially when it be cause by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality this be sad but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis have to do with something very personal like 'sexuality a taboo subject even today but i firmly believe in the right of individual to be free from impose regulation on thier bedroom funny that most straight people have successfully remove restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression ... a though it help u maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay people be not criminal another interest thing happen recently a very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley here have two of pastor arrest for self- admit charge of pederasty men have sex with boy this have apparently be go on for some time a couple year but since the charge be voluntary and the church work closely with the police so i imagine that be how they manage to downplay it in the medium how could such a thing happen when the church itself have an ex-gay ministry one of my friend recently told me he be `` approach '' by someone who be go through the reparitive therapy there and he be thoroughly convince that the request for dinner be not an invitation to attend the ministry these be difficult time we live in but provide hostile environment and create and perpetuate an atmosphere that breed hate and violence be not the call of the christian community the result of the passing amendment in colorado have create an organization who 's poster be appear all over colorado call `` s.t.r.a.i.g.h.t '' i forget the whole definition off hand but the last part be against immoral gross homosexual trash and their motto be `` work for a fag-free america '' with an implicit advocation for violence this be sick and it seem to be what you and mr. hudson and others be embrace we christian have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel 'measure up and constant beratement from organization like the christian research institute while they do have a good purpose also their major work seem to be find new and well way of exclude people the gospel i believe be not so negative rather it seek way to `` include '' people i have several of dr. martin 's book and find them quite helpful especially concern 'cults but it seem that cri have become a cult unto itself why we just stick to the positive and find way to bring people to jesus istead of take bullwhips and drive them away whatever"
b"i live in colorado and have never heard of such a group obviously claim that their poster be appear `` all over colorado '' be a tad overdone ... hardly say that homosexuality be a sin be a far cry from '' work for a fag-free america '' say that i want a homosexual babysitting for my kid doesnt mean i endorse '' against immoral gross homosexual trash '' and now we have homosexual advocate tell u that if we teach our kid that homosexuality be natural and a perfectly acceptable alternative lifestyle then they will have it do for u no thanks absolutely and the message be always `` go and sin no more '' not go and do whatever `` feel good '' this sound real nice but struck me a a little odd present yourself a if you be a straight xian who be stick his neck out and take on the challenge of speak out in support of gay in the church but i be under the impression that you yourself be gay all well and fine but present yourself a stick out your neck to help `` repress others '' seem a bit untruthful under the circumstance ..."
b'well when you crosspost to talk.origins what do you expect'
b"in article 93109.231733isscck byuvm.bitnet `` casper c. knies '' isscck byuvm .b a a latter-day saint i found john 's statement *not at all* ludicrous ... please allow me to explain myself in 1838 the governor of missouri governor boggs issue his so-called `` mormon extermination order '' the only crime `` illegal activity '' the latter-day saint have commit be their religious affiliation their anti-slave stance missouri still allow slave practice and their grow numbers/influence in missouri i guess the mormon `` get what they deserve '' because they refuse to bow to the will of corrupt and evil secular authority this `` disobedience '' brought upon them persecution murder and finally force expulsion from their land and settlement ... it be significant to remember that these secular position be held by '' average '' people and that at the time almost all american be pretty homogeonously christian it be largely the mainstream christian 's disgust at such practice a polygamy which result in their irrational hatred true but that be exactly the `` problem '' the mormon extermination order be issue not just by a christian it be allow under the constitution of the united state which be institute precisely to prevent incident like this `` order '' from occur in the first place ... a i indicate in an earlier post your `` irrational hatred '' be clearly evidence by individual like robert wei who could have be gov boggs lieutenant he would have fit right in drewling et al and seem a modern-day occurrence base on result slander persecution misrepresentation lie deny mormon representation in their own user group etc etc in intent and purpose what really have change the situation be not entirely different today many irrational feeling and belief be justified through religion i think most of them be start because of religion but religion certainly help justify and perpetuate prejudice and practice by provide a neat justification which discourages critical thought true a evidence by numerous example a i be sure aware in any regard mormon history alone indicates that secular authority and i even discus how uthan 's be suckered into allow part of their land in become nerve-gas and atomic bomb test ground ... be far from be trust or righteous have thing really change for the well i may be a born cynic but i have no reason whatsoever that such have be the case in the early 1980s i believe the late president kimball lds church leader strongly protest federal attempt to locate the mx- '' peace keeper '' missile maze from be built in utah yet another `` inspire '' decision from secular authority fortunately his opposition be influential enough for the fed to back off do you mean that the `` secular authority '' be some continuous group of people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the mormon do you honestly believe that the main reason for use utah for nuclear test etc.. be to `` get them thar mormon '' and what about the majority of uthan 's who mormon you seem to be search for enemy ^^^^^^^^ correction the majority of utahn 's be mormon 60-70 i believe up to a 100 in many city and settlement throughout the western state conspiracy it be paranoid to believe that everything that affect you badly must have be do primarily for that purpose what i mean be that secular authority be to be watch a we believe that satan have be give some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice in addition we believe that the adversary have power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil combination a an intelligent be you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power a far a utah be concerned what i point out be some horrible example of environmental nightmare impose upon by secular authority which have brought death disease i.e the `` downwinders '' and environmental contami- nation i be hardly `` paranoid '' i be just not `` expect '' too much from a secular government that may not share our value and faith and which indeed a gov boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy u a a matter of fact prophecy in my church indicate that in future year global persecution against mormon will so increase in intensity and scope that paraphrase `` all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to zion '' zion the `` pure in heart '' will be re-established in those day and it ai n't our current secular authority who will rule over it ... ... david koresh do not pose a great threat to the federal authority or the security of this nation and with john i too wonder who or what 's next ... i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who be a threat to the life of even one person sure he do not pose a threat to the security of this nation but he do pose a threat to the life of his follower that much be definite hmmm `` definite '' by whom -- until such have be establish beyond reason- able doubt this allege `` threat '' may have be less than the `` threat '' impose upon him and his follower by the batf and fbi ... who kill who what constitutional right do the atf officer have to invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound what really cause the `` murder '' of the little child could it be that the atf/fbi presence have any bearing upon the event how would you interpret the mt masada event -- blame the jew what the heck do the roman do there anyway what business do the atf/fbi have in waco texas the branch davidians never pose any threat to society this be like ask who really cause the death of the israeli olympic team in 1976 in that case the police botch the job a well but to lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorist would be a terrible mistake i think the same sort of reason applies in this case certainly if david koresh chose any peaceful option the atf and fbi would have comply the responsibility be more his than the authority come now at issue be in how much the authority escalate an otherwise peaceful stand-off `` let 's get it over with and `` force '' david koresh to come out '' -- by gas them be they naive or what they played right into the hand of an apocalyptic-thinking individual he have prepared his people for this eventuality for year and not *one* firetruck or plan be in place to deal with this scenario i feel that the authority have `` some '' responsibility to protect their own citizen even if they be religious zealot and guilty of ... not pay a 200 gun license have the batf become an extension of the local tax-collectors david koresh no doubt will be described a the `` evil '' guy by the executioner while the action of all those `` valiant and brave '' officer characterize the atf/fbi a executioner be inaccurate and unfair in order to be an executioner the least one must have do be have the intent to kill que -- intrusion into private property with semi 's load with life ammunition that implicit `` intent or at least `` prepared '' to kill '' i ask you would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justice i do not mind if criminal such a dangerous drug lord be brought to justice but escalate event to the point of allow to if not compli- city with the destruction of a people -- *isaac kuo

b'well look at the video it seem that this fire start in various place at the same time which would indicate that this be a plan action sure fbi and batf *deliberately* start a possible fire have a sniper kill korresh would have be a far easy method look at the careful operation and use of tear gas that a i know start fire it be less likely that this be the case sorry but my bet be on fanatical people keen to start armageddon -- theirs cheer kent'

b"ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade magi sneak preview later still eschatology and apocalyptics be a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo-christian religion a can be see in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_ a work whose iranian root be undeniable and which most likely date from the begin of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren 1968 the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant be the basis for the story of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ 2:1-12 the old persian word magu render in greek by magos be of uncertain etymology it may originally have meant `` member of the tribe '' a in the avestan compound mogu-tbish `` hostile to a member of the tribe '' this meaning would have be far resticted among the medes to `` member of the priestly tribe '' and perhaps to `` priest '' benveniste 1938 boyce 1982 the term be probably of median origin give that herodotus mention the `` magoi '' a one of the six tribe of the medes for a variety of reason we can consider the magi to have be member of a priestly tribe of median origin in western iran among the persian they be responsible for liturgical function a well a for maintain their knowledge of the holy and the occult most likely the supremacy of the median priesthood in western iran become establish during the time of the median monarchy that dominate the persian from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus the great 550 bce the persian be indebted to the medes for their political and civil institution a well even if hypothesis have be advanced concern the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period boyce 1982 we must still maintain that they be of median origin this be demonstrate by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the magian mention by darius i 522-486 bce in the inscription at bisutun iran a well a by greek source indeed herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the medes against the persian through the conspiracy of the magi the fact that the magi may have be member of a tribe that hand down the sacerdotal art in a hereditary fashion naturally do not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions this seem to be attest by the elamite tablet at persepolis there be a thesis put forth by giuseppe messina that denies that the magi be member of an ethnic group by suggest that they be simply member of the priesthood a priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin this thesis be untenable on the other hand the hypothesis that their name be related to the avestan term magavan derive from the gathic maga vedic magha `` gift '' be not without foundation mole 1963 the meaning of maga can probably be found in conformity with the pahlavi tradition within the context of the concept of purity or separation of the `` mixture '' of the two oppose principle of spirit and matter the maga which have be erroneously interpret a `` chorus '' from the root mangh which be say to mean `` sing the magic song '' nyberg 1966 and have be render simply by an expression like unio mystica seem to be an ecstatic condition that open the mind to spiritual vision in any case though there may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan term magavan and maga we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and the avestan priesthood the avesta ignores the median or old persian term despite a recent hypothesis propose by h.w bailey old persian inscription ignore the avestan term for `` priest '' athravan vedic athravan even if this be perhaps present in an achaeminid set in the elamite tablet of persepolis gershevitch 1964 the term magu have be present in zoroastrianism throughout it history the pahlavi term mogh-mard and mobad represent it continuation the latter in particular derives from an old form magupati `` head of the magi '' during the sasanid period third to seventh century ce which saw the formation of a hierarchically organize church the title mobadan mobad `` the high priest of high priest '' come to be use to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy the magi practice consanguineous marriage or khvaetvadatha av pahl. khwedodah they also perform a characteristic funeral rite the exposure of the corpse to animal and vulture to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it the corpse be not suppose to decompose l it be contaminate by the demon of putrefaction this practice later become typical of the entire zoroastrian community and lead to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsi in india stone tower know a dakhmas be built especially for this rite during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse be in vogue only among the magi the persian generally sprinkle the corpse with wax then bury it the practice be widespread however among the people of central asia the magi be the technician of and expert on worship it be impossible to offer sacrifice without the presence of a magus during the performance of a ritual sacrifice the magus sang of the theogony the magi be possibly the custodian of a tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various part of the avesta and be call upon to interpret dream and to divine the future the magi be also know for the practice of kill harmful or `` ahrimanical '' animal khrafstra such a snake and ant they dress in the median style wear pant tunic and coat with sleeve they wore a characteristic head cover of felt gr tiara with strip on the side that could be use to cover the nose and mouth during ritual to avoid contaminate consecrate object with their breath boyce 1982 the color of these cap in conformity with a tradition that be probably of indo-european origin accord to george dumezil be that of the priesthood white in all likelihood during the achaemenid period the magi be not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine and it be probable that they gradually adopt zoroastrianism they be most likely a clergy consist of professional priest who be not tie to a rigid orthodoxy but be naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism nonetheless they must have be jealous guardian of the patrimony of zorastrian tradition by virtue of this they be the educator of the royal prince the wise of them be responsible for teach the prince the `` magic of zarathushtra son of horomazes '' and thus the `` cult of the god '' magi who excel in other virtue be entrust with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageous and master of himself during the achaemenid period the magi maintain a position of great influence although they be certainly subordinate to the emperor despite several dramatic event such a the massacre they suffer after the death of gaumata the magian in which accord to herodotus who call himself smerdis the persian kill a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation the magi nevertheless manage to maintain their influence at court in medium in persia and in the various region of the empire where they be station a a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration no priesthood of antiquity be more famous than that of the magi they be renowned a follower of zarathushtra zoroaster a the teacher of some of the great greek thinker pythagoras democritus plato a the wise men who arrive guide by a star at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem and a the propagator of a cult of the sun in india but they be also know a the chaldean the priesthood of babylon know for it occultism this be perhaps the reason that the term magos have a pejorative sense in greek like `` go '' `` expert in the magic art '' bidez and cumont 1938 indeed the chaldean be expert in all type of magical art especially astrology and have a reputation for wisdom a well a knowledge to understand the reason for such various and sometimes discordant view it be necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so-called western magi who be later hellenized in the achaemenid period both must have be at least in part zoroastrian but the western magi those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor syria mesopotamia and armenia who come in contact with diverse religious tradition must have sooner or later and in vary degree be influence by syncretic concept the greek be familiar with both kind of magi and depend on their vary concern would emphasize one or the other aspect of them classical historian and geographer include herodotus and strabo document their custom while the philosopher dwell above all on their doctrine dualism belief in the hereafter magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theology and eschatology those source most interested in the doctrine of the magi even speak of zarathushtra a a magus in do so they be repeat what the magi themselves say from the median and achaemenid period when they adopt zoroastrianism at that time they embrace zarathushtra a one of their own and place themselves under his venerable name zoroastrianism have already undergone several profound transformation in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenids and be already adapt those element of the archaic religion that refuse to die it have be say quite often in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition that the vendidad from vi-daevo-data `` the law-abjuring daivas '' part of the avesta should be attribute to them this collection of text from various period be primarily concerned with purificatory rule and practice nonetheless the hypothesis be hardly plausible since the first chapter of the vendidad a list of sixteen land create by ahura mazda the supreme god of zoroastrianism but contaminate by an attack by ahriman pahl gathic-avestan angra mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffer do not mention western iran persia or medium the land of ragha mention in the text can not be median raghiana furthermore it have be note gershevitch 1964 that if the author have be magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institution include their own priesthood would be very strange the magi be above all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the avesta have be transmit to u from the second half of the first millennium bce on this have be their principal merit we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assume know to u especially from greek source and in part from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth century ce accord to this formulation the two pole of the dualism be no longer a in the gathas spenta mainyu `` beneficent spirit '' and angra mainyu `` hostile spirit '' but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu gershevitch 1964 see ahura mazda and angra mainyu this trans- formation be of immense consequence for the historical development of zoro- astrianism and be most likely determine by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religious world in this new dualism which be that later know to the greek aristotle eudemus of rhodes theopompus and others we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism to which we give the name zurvanism see zurvanism thanks to their adherence to zoroastrianism the magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of zarathushtra 's treachings a well a in the definition of the new form that these would assume historically their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also help the diffusion of zoroastrian idea in the community of the iranian diaspora the greek begin to study their doctrine and to take an interest in them xanthus of lydia hermodorus aristotle theopompus hermippus dinon even write treatise on the persian religion of which only the title and a few fragment have survive in the hellenistic period the magi be see a a secular school of wisdom and writing on magic astrology and alchemy be lent the authority of such prestigious name a zarathushtra ostanes and hystaspes form an abundant apocryphal literature bidez and cumont 1938 later still eschatology and apocalyptics be a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo-christian religion a can be see in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_ a work whose iranian root be undeniable and which most likely date from the begin of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren 1968 the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant be the basis for the story of the come of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ 2:1-12 see saoshyant the sasanid period saw the magi once again play a determine role in the religious history of iran concerned to win back the western magi de menasce 1956 and eager to consolidate zoroastrianism a the national religion of iran the priest

b"very well put and in the case of someone who call himself a christian brother yet continue in his sin and claim that his sin be not a sin at all but perfectly acceptable what should be do should christian just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person by reaffirm that the lifestyle be sinful accord to the bible be they use `` a bullwhip to drive people from jesus '' frankly i find the occurance of a homosexual christian attempt to pas himself off a a 'straight christian in order to have other christian accept his chastisement well a *lot* more serious than people reaffirm that the bible teach homosexuality be a sin"

b"zoroastrianism san jose ca usa monday april 5 1993 san jose mercury news page 1 reproduce without permission _3,700-year tradition still glow 'assimilation in u.s. threatens ancient zoroastrian religion by jeanne huber mercury news staff writer high on a hillside above san jose flame leap up 24 hour a day from a gleam brass urn in a temple one of only four in the united state dedicate to one of the world 's most ancient religion with the flame go the prayer of about 1,200 bay area zoroastrian that their faith will survive this land `` there be a fear a real fear too '' say silloo tarapore of lafayette `` we have one generation to do it or to die '' many immigrant group struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land but for zoroastrian it be an especially poignant concern their religion have be around for perhaps 3,700 year a heritage so deep it scarcely seem comprehensible in a state where `` historical site '' be sometimes less than 100 year old it be the religion of the great persian empire under king cyrus and darius and tradition say that when christ be born about 500 year later he be honor by a visit from three zoroastrian priest the magi scholar say many key belief of christian jew and muslim can be trace to the teaching of zoroaster the zoroastrian prophet yet with only about 150,000 zoroastrian in the entire world they be a miniscule minority in every country in which they live survival a a people be very much on their mind ironically local zoroastrian fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the united state may do what hundred of year of persecution follow by nearly 1,000 year of benign religious segregation could not do cause their young people to stop think of themselves a zoroastrian zoroastrian do not believe theirs be the only right religion and they actually shun the notion of try to win convert so if their child become totally assimilate they say their child rather than the world at large who will be the losers. `` important to have an identity '' say maneck bhujwaia of san jose a leader among zoroastrian who come here from india. `` important for everybody irish scottish american it give meaning to life you have to depend on the majority community to give you respect you can fall back on your own identity '' for zoroastrian there 's much to be proud of their prophet zoroaster seek to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple god be common preach that there be only one god a good one zoroastrian call their god ahura mazda which translates a lord of wisdom and light _good vs. evil_ zoroaster saw life a a constant struggle between good and evil with the good eventually win men and woman could join in the battle for good he say and he warn that they would inevitably suffer consequence such a shame and sorrow if they do wrong he preach honesty charity kindness to animal respect for the environment hard work equality of men and woman basic virtue preach by prophet of many religion but zoroaster be perhaps unusual in that he told his follower not to follow him blindly he demand they think for themselves in fact joseph campbell the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myth trace the western emphasis on individual thought to the zoroastrian zoroastrian have many word for thought their motto lead into a stain glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slope of mount hamilton be `` good thought good word good deed '' so not surprising that zoroastrian value education highly in india where a contingent of zoroastrian arrive in the ninth century to escape persecution by muslim in iran zoroastrian claim 100 percent literacy the overall statistic in india be just 60 percent about half of the bay area zoroastrian community come here from india and pakistan mostly to study at university the other half flee from iran after the 1979 revolution make that a fundamentalist islamic state where others have no right local zoroastrian point with pride to way their emphasis on `` good deed '' have improve life in every country they inhabit in san jose the recent restoration of the hotel sainte clarie come about because manou mobedshahi a san francisco-based hotelier pass the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple at the temple's dedication the chief guest of honor be the mother of zubin mehta the zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmonic orchestra the temple exists because of another good deed the decision by an iranian emigre the late arbab rustom guiv to buy land for six temple in north america besides the 10-acre site off crothers road on mount hamilton he paid for land in los angeles chicago new york toronto and vancouver until his gift there be no zoroastrian temple on this continent local zoroastrian raise money to build the actual temple and the property already have a large house that they have convert to a community center the temple dedicate a year ago on the birthday of the prophet zoroaster be a simple structure with gleam white wall vault ceiling and oak floor partially cover with huge oriental carpet it central feature be the fire set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building although zoroastrian be sometimes call `` fire worshipper '' they actually consider fire just a symbol of god `` it help u concentrate just like christian use the cross and muslim use the holy book '' bhujwala say the big celebration of the year occurs in early spring for all iranian include zoroastrian the new year begin on the first day of the season because of it symbolism a the start of new life with zoroaster 's birthday just six day later the combination of religious and secular holiday creates something on par with what most of the united state celebrates between christmas and jan. 1. for this year 's celebration of the prophet 's birthday about 500 people come to worship and revel `` the good thing in life be not forbidden '' esfandiar anoushiravani a leader of the iranian member have say beforehand and what follow prove him right inside the temple worshiper fill every chair and sat or stood around the edge of the room a about a half-dozen priest chant thanksgiving prayer around a table laden with brazier of smoking sandalwood glass of milk and water and a tray heaped with dry fruit and nut kid crowd around grab handful of the treat `` people eat the fruit '' tarapore said. `` a way to participate in the ceremony '' _santa claus sort of_ the gathering even have a santa claus iranian style with flow white hair and a bag of gift for the child this amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring and red he be ushed in by a sort of spring clown hajefyrouz who dance and played a tambourine the zoroastrian from india be charm `` this be all new for u too '' one told a visitor who ask what be go on a visitor john a. sabanovich of folsom say he become intrigue with the religion year ago while on business trip to iran zoroastrian have no procedure for accept convert a result some say of their century of persecution in iran follow by their promise to the hindu king who allow them into india that they would not interfere with his people 's religion but that do not stop sabavich from join in the celebration at the san jose temple whenever he can `` when i first heard about this religion '' he say `` i thought my god this be what a religion should be they think for themselves and do good `` people who have a tradition something to lean on what 's the difference with the low animal ''"

b"i agree which be why ask for help with it the reason work on this list be because recently have one too many christian tell me `` the bible contains no contradiction whatsoever '' they believe that true and that it describes reality perfectly and even predicts history before it happens before i can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these people get to show them with concrete evidence that the bible be not nearly a airtight a they thought i hope to do that with this list specifically when i bring up the fact that genesis contains two contradictory creation story i usually get blank stare or flat denial never have a fundamentalist acknowledge that there be indeed two different account of creation"
