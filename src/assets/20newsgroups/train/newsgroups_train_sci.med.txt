various calendar batch queue program available from various source platform various description any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turn into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that let you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen use window a an example create a calendar file and include this filename in your win.ini 's 'load= line so you get it on every startup of window suppose you want to have break every 30 minute start from 9 be press f7 special time ... to enter an appointment enter 9:30 hit enter and type some text in say what the break be for then press f5 to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment by use window recorder you can record the keystroke that set up break throughout a day in a .rec file put this file on your 'run= line a above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointment with rsi exercise the above method should be adaptable to most calendar program an example use batch job would be to submit a simple job that run at 9:30 be and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system while these approach be not ideal they be a good way of force yourself to take a break if you get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you be techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for your operating system use batch job or whatever fit best tool digital watch with count-down timer available from various source e.g casio bp-100 description many digital watch have timer that count down from a settable number of minute they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these be a very basic tool they be very useful if you be write reading drive or do anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage be that they remind you to break from whatever you be do comment my own experience be that cut down a lot on my type lead to my write a lot more and still reading a much a ever which actually aggravate the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improve get a count-down timer watch have be very useful on some occasion where i write a lot in a day i have try an old fashion hour-glass type egg timer but these be not much good because they do not give an audible warn of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tool these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout one-handed type tool may help but be very careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall type workload you be simply double your hand use for the hand that you use for type and may therefore make matter bad tool hsh public domain available from anonymous ftp soda.berkeley.edu pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar platform unix know which one description allows one-handed type and other general keyboard remappings only work through tty 's so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most x program tool dvorak keyboard tool various available from anonymous ftp soda.berkeley.edu pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c also built into window 3.x description the dvorak keyboard apparently us a more rational layout that involves more balance hand use it *may* help prevent rsi a bit but you

verification the software give you two `` error '' at this point blue which be word that be convert reliability but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary yellow shade which be word that wordscan plus think it convert correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it be usually correct instead of wrong if a word be shade blue you can add it to your

public health system have be challenged by a myriad of newly identify pathogen and syndrome e.g. escherichia coli o157 h7 hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaire disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidence of many disease widely presume to be under control such a cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increase in many area furthermore control and prevention of infectious disease be undermined by drug resistance in condition such a gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infection 2 emerge infection place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised person those in institutional setting e.g. hospital and child day care center and minority and underserved population the substantial economic burden of emerge infection on the u.s. health-care system could be reduce by more effective surveillance system and target control and prevention program 3 this issue of mmwr introduces a new

control point in processing a a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogen such a e. coli o157 h7 enter the meat supply because slaughter practice can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogen and because the process of grind beef may transfer pathogen from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef be likely to be internally contaminate the optimal food protection practice be to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior be no longer pink and the juice be clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patty likely played an important role the

b"your doctor be right it be best to do nothing besides take some pain medication initially some patient like this and expect or demand to have something do in these case some physician will `` tape '' the patient put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest or prescribe an elastic binder all this do be make it harder to breath but the patient feel cheat because soemthing be be do about the problem either way the end result be the same =================================="
b'a very simple question it seem to me that the contraceptive pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and force it to fall every month but it do not prevent the fertilzation of the ovule be it true if yes be there a risk of extra-uterine pregnancy that be the development of the ovule inside the fallopian tube actually that be not how the pill work but it *is* how the iud work the oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occur by provide negatve feedback to the pituitary gland and thus prevent the lh surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation with the iud what happens be that fertilization may occur but the device prevents implantation within the wall of the uterus *not* the vagina'

news from the national institute of dental research there be new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of it ability to suppress the immune system say scientist at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection cause scale skin condition to develop in mouse carry the gene for hiv although the hiv gene be active in the mouse they do not compromise the animal immunity the researcher found this lead them to conclude that the hiv itself cause the skin disease our finding support a grow body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affect the immune system say lead author dr. jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr. kopp and his colleague described their study in the march issue of aid research and human retrovirus develop animal model of hiv infection have be difficult since most animal include mouse can not be infect by the virus to bypass this problem scientist have developed hiv-transgenic mouse which carry gene for hiv a well a their own genetic material nidr scientist create the transgenic mouse by inject hiv gene into mouse egg and then implant the egg into female mouse the result litter contain both normal and transgenic animal institute scientist have create mouse that carry a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l988 those mouse however become sick and die too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientist use an incomplete copy of hiv which allow the animal to live longer some of the transgenic animal developed scale wart-like tumor on their neck and back other transgenic mouse developed thicken crust skin lesion that cover most of their body resemble psoriasis in human no skin lesion developed in their normal non-transgenic littermates study of tissue take from the wart-like skin tumor show that they be a type of noncancerous tumor call papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesion laboratory test show no sign of that virus in the animal tissue sample take from the sick mouse throughout the study reveal the presence of a protein-producing molecule make by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page 50 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 evidence of hiv protein production prove that the viral gene be `` turn on '' or active say dr. kopp the scientist found no evidence however of compromise immunity in the mouse no increase in their white blood cell count and no sign of common infection the fact that hiv gene be active but the animal immune system be not suppress confirms that the virus itself be cause the skin lesion dr. kopp say far proof of hiv gene involvement come from a test in which the scientist expose the transgenic animal to ultraviolet light the light increase hiv genetic activity cause papilloma to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increase hiv genetic activity prove the gene be responsible for the skin condition the scientist say no lesion appear on normal mouse expose to the uv light the transgenic mouse use in this study be developed at nidr by dr. peter dickie who be now

b"a promise below be a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog i be very pleased with the result the catalog description be a follow the pressure

that move in one-inch orbit -- release tension in the neck back leg and arm pressure point massager a2623 109 to order or receive a catalog call 24 hour 7 day 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021 ******** note when i order the massager the item number be different and the price be 179 not 109 when i receive it i glance thru the newer catalog enclose with it to see anything be different from the first one i be quite annoyed to see a 70 difference in price i call them about it and the cust rep say that they have switch manufacturer although it look and work exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one use the price difference a a reason for return in fact since the newer one might take a while to ship from the factory i receive this one in 3 day he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable people ******** i have long-term neck shoulder and back pain if i be a building i would be described a `` structurally unsound i have stretch and exercise to do that help but the problem never really go away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enough time lazy etc the muscle become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to far strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which 1st require a doctor visit to get the prescription for p.t the tension in my neck if not release eventually cause a headache sometimes confuse with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist have massage my neck and the sub-occipital muscle in particular the 2 knobby area near the base of the skull the headache usually ease within a day although it hurt like hell to while it be be massage i order this device because it seem to be exactly what i be wish someone would invent -- a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub-occipital muscle like my physical therapist have do in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p.t appts for a week later would be need to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have be use it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit be about a 14 '' x 9 '' rectangle about 3-3/4 '' high with handle on each side and it plug into an average outlet the two metal `` thumb '' be about 1-1/2 '' in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2 '' above the base the thumb be cover with a gray cloth that be non-removable they be locate more toward one end rather than center see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction depend on which side of the switch be push and be very quiet it can be use from either side for instance the thumb can be position at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depend on which direction you approach it _______________________________ __ _______________ __ \\^^/ \\^^/ || || |_______________| |__| |__| |_______________________________| for the neck/head the user varies the amount of pressure use by if lay down allow all or part of the full weight of the head and/or neck to rest on the thumb the handle can also be use if sit or stand apply pressure with the arms/wrists since my wrist be also impaired type this over an extend period of time and i have someone living with me who can apply it lay down work well for me for my back i sit in a high-backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massage and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of lean back hold it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inch whenever i feel like it for my back this machine be far superior to use than the commonly use `` home-made '' massager of 2 tennis ball taped together with the ball position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis ball be well than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quad be not in good shape and my long hair get painfully in the way if i pin it up first a far a concerned the easy something like this be to use the more likely i 'll use/do it if there be multiple considerations/hassles more likely to not bother with it not only have this machine help with my headache but my range of motion for my neck and back be greatly increase the first time i use it on my neck/sub-occipital muscle however i overdid it and press too hard against it which result in a very tender almost bruise area for a few day i laid off it for about 3 day and apply ice which help after that i be more gradual about apply pressure at this point the pain in the sub-occipital area be now minimal while be massage i also learn to use very light pressure on my low back which be the most vulnerable point for me it also ease some painful knot of tension between my shoulder blade although again it take a few day of massage just a few minute at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problem although i can not vouch for it durability it seem pretty sturdy since have it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercise and maybe after too i have be ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few week so this be very timely for me this be the 1st product order from this company and only recently become aware of it thru a co-worker the catalog state they have be in business since 1976. it contains quite a few health care product and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog product they also appear to be of much high quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other one see such a `` dr. leonard health care catalog '' or `` mature wisdom '' only 37 but have end up on some geriatric-type mail list no big surprise here i consider many of those product to be rip-off particularly target toward the elderly with dubious health benefit i apologize for the length of this but the kind of info _i_ would like to know before order something

b"i get ask in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decide to post my answer here a well because of the recent question about kidney stone not long after i get into sci med i get flame by a medical fellow for state that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation go to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stone from form be to take b6 supplement read on to find out why i have my asbestos suit on now guy vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large dos be need above 6 gram per day 1. review article `` nutritional factor in calcium contain kidney stone with particular emphasis on vitamin c '' int clin nutr rev 5 3 :110-129 1985 but glycine also form oxalic acid d-amino acid oxidase for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best way to drastically reduce this production be not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b6 2 `` control of hyperoxaluria with large dos of pyridoxine in patient with kidney stone '' int urol nephrol 20 4 :353-59 1988 200 to 500 mg of b6 each day significasntly decrease the urinary excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program 3. the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria '' clin sci 38 :277-86 1970 patient receive at least 150mg b6 each day show a significant reduction in urinary oxalate level for gylcine this effect be due to increase transaminase activity b6 be require for transaminase activity which make less glycine available for oxidative deamination d-amino acid oxidase for vitamin c the effect be quite different there be different pathway for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that lead to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40 of the ingest dose go into oxalic acid but this be highly variable and the vitamin c review article point out that unless the dose get upto 6 gram per day not too much vitamin c get catabolize to form oxalic acid at very high dos of vitamin c above 10 gram per day more of the extra vitamin c more than 40 conversion can end up a oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med 85:190-92 1954 intake of 2 gram per day up to 9 gram per day increase the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day until 8 gram per day be reach the average excrete be increase by only 3 to 12mg per day 2 gram dose 4 gram dose 8 gram dose and 9gram dose 8 gram jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 gram jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation b6 be require by more enzyme than any other vitamin in the body there be probably some enzyme that require vitamin b6 that we know about yet vitamin c catabolism be still not completely understood but the speculation be that this other pathway that do not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that require b6 difference in b6 level could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge this be not the prefer route of catabolism increase your intake of b6 would then result in less oxalic acid be formmed if you take vitamin c supplement since the typical american diet be deficient in b6 some researcher believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stone be b6 deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid get absorbed from the gut diet provide 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day show absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol int.35:309 -15,1980 if 400mg be present each day there be a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here be the high oxalate food 1. bean coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least 25mg/100grams 2. beet top carrot celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanut pepper sweet potatoe contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams if the threshold be 130mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n.eng.j med article also point out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation be to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from be absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b6 you have to worry about kidney stone at all the rda for b6 be 2mg per day for male and 1.6mg per day for female directly related to protein intake b6 can be toxic nerve damage if it be consume in dos of 500mg or more per day for an extend peroid week to month the usda food survey do in 1986 have an average intake of 1.87 mg per day for male and 1.16mg per day for female living in the u.s. couple with this low intake be a high protein diet which greatly increase the b6 requirement a well a the presence of some of the 40 different drug that either block b6 absorption be metabolic antagonist of b6 or promote b6 excretion in the urine common one be birth control pill alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroid i tell my student to supplement all their patient that be go to get any of the drug that increase the b6 requirement the dose recommend for patient take birth control pill be 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drug that increase the b6 requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of b6 any patient that have a history of kidney stone formation should be give b6 supplement one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation be to make sure your ca/mg dietary ratio be 2/1 magnesium-oxalate be much more soluble than be calcium-oxalate 4 `` the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrate urine of patient with calcium oxalate calculus '' invest urol 10:147 1972 5 `` effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine change producted by food-magnesium interaction '' j. urol 143 2 :248-51 1990

b"i may not be the world 's great expert on chigger a type of mite indigenous to the south but i certainly have spent a lot of time contemplate the little bugger over the past six year since we move to n.c. here be some observation gain from painful experience 1. reaction to chigger vary greatly from person to person some people get tiny red bite others like me be more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affair 2. chigger bite be the gift that keep on give i swear that these thing will itch for month 3. there be a lot of folklore about chigger i think most of it be fiction i have try to do research on the critter since they have such an effect on me the only book i could find on the subject be a *single* book in unc 's special collection library i have not yet go through what be require to get it 4. base on my experience and that of my family member the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply work i recall reading that the theory upon which it be base that the chigger burrow into your skin and continue to party there be false i think it be more likely that the reaction be to toxin of some sort the little pest release but this be speculation 5. the *best* approach be prevention a couple of thing work well a good insect repellent deet such a deep wood off liberally apply to ankle waistband etc be a good start there be another preparation call `` chig away '' that be a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally be prepared for the army and be not commercially available in the summer i put this on my ankle every morning when i get up on weekend since i literally go outside where we live in the country without serious consequence they apparently like sulfur much at all you can use sulfur a a dust on your body or clothing to repel them 6. no amount of prevention will be *completely* successful forget the fingernail polish i have finally settle upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme reduces the inflamation and swell and benzocaine relief the itch i tell you all the thing try nor will i tell you some of the thing my wife do since this count a minor surgery and be best not mention i also think it gain nothing 7. the swell and itch can also be significantly relieve by the application of hot pack and this seem to speed recovery a well doctor seem not to care much about chigger the urban and suburban doctor apparently encounter them much and the rural doctor seem to regard them a a force of nature that one must endure i suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chigger would make a *lot* of money"

b"no one else seem to know so i 'll post this this topic come up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap start a i recall it be do to some experimental mouse they show various ill effect and eventually die the reason be that deuterium do not have exactly the same reaction rate a hydrogen due to it extra mass which cause low velocity boltzman constant mumble this throw various bit of body biochemistry out of kilter and you get sick and die never heard of anyone be poisened this way in or out of real life the process take quite a while if anyone want to write this book i would imagine you would have to 1 replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water 2 wait while normal breakdown and repair process cause other molecule in the body to be synthesise use the deuterium during this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die but i imagine it would take week during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingest be heavy you would get such a mess of symptom that the doctor would be both alarmed and confuse why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate if you can figure out how the poisoner get the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here come to think of it 2 would continue even after the heavy water be no longer be ingest so hospitalisation might be too late the most detectable effect would be that the victim 's body fluid would literally be `` heavy '' water have a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water have a mw of 20. thus the victim 's weight will increase by about 1 for every 10 of body water replace by heavy water maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notice that the victim 's urine be strangely dense be there any medical test involve the specific gravity of a body fluid paul"

b"avoid mistake be certainly highly desirable however it be also widely acknowledge that perfectionism be inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carry beyond a certain point be indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyze by all the possible mistake he might make that he be unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover a much truth about the world a possible and we also want to have a much certainty a possible about these discovery usually there be some trade-off between these two desideratum -- the search for scope and the search for certainty if 18th century mathematician have demand total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really make sense since they lack the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they make a number of error in their use of calculus it be only a hundred year later that weistrass be able to give a solid ground for the idea of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz do be undoubtedly science and mathematics gain a great deal more from the application of their important idea than it lose through the mistake they make these be not the rule accord to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology accord to these poster `` if not support by carefully design control study then not science '' take to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical study be everything and idea be nothing result in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology result in a sort of scientific trade-unionism where those outside the establishment and lack institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i in the least believe that this be the intention of the arbiter of scientific methodology nonetheless it be one of the result and although institutional science have certainly produce many wonderful result i think it be a foolish arrogance for scientist to believe that no one outside the establishment -- and use less than perfect empirical methodology -- will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big buck approach to science promotes what i think be one of the most significant error in science choose to investigate question because they can be readily handle by the currently fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them instead of direct attention to those question which seem to have fundamental significance for instance certain question can not be easily investigate with statistical method because the relevant factor be not quantitative one could argue that this be the case for almost all question in many area of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the paper result from the attempt by psychologist to force these question into a statistical framework give the lie to russell turpin's assertion that current scientific method `` avoid all know error '' i think that ask the wrong question be probably the most fundamental error in science ignore potentially valuable idea be one of the others and i think that scientific journal be full of all too many study do with impeccable empirical method but which be worthless because the wrong question be ask in the first place -- in the argument between behaviorist and cognitivists psychology seem less like a science than a collection of compete religious sect"

to 1992 and constitute 9.7 of all report case in 1992. although the large proportional increase by age group occur among person age 35-44 year 80.4 and great than or equal to 45 year 87.7 these age group account for only 11.0 of all report case in 1992. person in the 15-19-year age group account for the large number of report case of gonorrhea during 1992 and the high age group-specific rate 639 per 100,000 report case of gonorrhea increase 32.9 in the five-county denver metropolitan area 1990 population 1,629,466 but decrease elsewhere in the state table 1 half the case of gonorrhea in the denver metropolitan area occur in 8.4 34 of the census tract these represent neighborhood consider by sexually transmit disease std /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aid field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity when compare with 1991 the number of gonorrhea case diagnose among men in the denver metro health clinic dmhc the primary public std clinic in the denver metropolitan area

dept of health jm douglas md denver dept of health and hospital surveillance and information system br div of sexually transmit disease and hiv prevention national center for prevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in report gonorrhea case in colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulate by visitation to laboratory by cdh surveillance staff during 1991-1992. the increase in confirm gonorrhea case at dmhc and in culture-positivity rate in three of four laboratory suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serf a network of clinic statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase do not uniformly affect all segment of the population one possible explanation for the increase occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior a implicate in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other std in colorado spring 2 although the high morbidity census tract in the denver metropolitan area coincide with area of gang and drug activity this hypothesis require far assessment to examine the possible role of drug use -- implicate previously a a factor contribute to the national increase in syphilis 3-6 -- the cdh std/aids program be collect information from all person in whom gonorrhea be diagnose regard drug use exchange of sex for money or drug and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for black in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 1300 per 100,000 objective 19.1a 7 race be likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other std risk marker may be useful for identify group at great risk for std and for target prevention effort moreover race- specific variation in std rate may reflect difference in factor such a socioeconomic status access to medical care and high-risk behavior in response to the increase occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado intervention initiate by the cdh std/aids program include 1 target partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to person in group at increase risk e.g. 15-19-year-old black female and 20-24-year-old black male 2 implement a medium campaign e.g. public service radio hicnet medical newsletter

volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 effectiveness in disease and injury prevention impact of adult safety-belt use on restraint use among child less than 11 year of age -- select state 1988 and 1989 ====================================================== source mmwr 42 14 date apr 16 1993 motor-vehicle crash be the lead cause of death among child and young adult in the united state and account for more than 1 million year of potential life lose before age 65 annually 1 child safety seat and safety belt can substantially reduce this loss 2 from 1977 through 1985 all 50 state pass legislation require the use of child safety seat or safety belt for child although these law reduce injury to young child by an estimate 8 -59 3,4 motor-vehicle crash-related injury remain a major cause of disability and death among u.s. child 1 while the use of occupant restraint among child decrease inversely with age 84 usage for those age 0-4 year 57 age 5-11 year and 29 age 12-18 year 5 in addition parent who do not use safety belt themselves be less likely to use restraint for their child 6 to characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraint for the young child age less than 11 year within a household cdc analyze data obtain from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during 1988 and 1989. this report summarizes the finding from this study data be available for 20,905 respondent age great than or equal to 18 year in 11 state that participate in brfss -- a population-based random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administer a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondent 5499 26 have a child age less than 11 year in their household each respondent be ask to specify the child 's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two category of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in this analysis be 1 consistent use i.e. always buckle up and 2 less than consistent use i.e. almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data be weight to provide estimate representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan 7 be use to calculate point estimate and confidence interval statistically significant difference be define by p value of less than 0.05. each of the 11 state have some type of child restraint law of these six arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia have no law require adult to use safety belt four idaho maryland pennsylvania and washington have a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law i.e. a vehicle have to be stop for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belt could be issue and one state new york have a primary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law i.e. vehicle could be stop for a safety-belt law violation alone in nine state child-passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page 17 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 law include all child age less than 5 year but the other two state use both age and size of the child a criterion for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped state into 1 those have a law require adult safety-belt use law state and 2 those without such a law no-law state overall 21 of child age less than 11 year reportedly be not consistently restrain during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use be significantly high p less than 0.05 chi-square test in law state than in no-law state 81.1 versus 74.3 and 58.7 versus 43.2 respectively high rate of restraint use for child age less than or equal to 1 year be report by both adult indicate consistent and less than consistent safety-belt use figure 1 adult with consistent use report high rate of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child 's age range 95.5 for 1-year-olds to 84.7 for 10-year-olds in comparison for adult reporting less than consistent safety-belt use the rate of child- occupant restraint use decline sharply by the age of the child range 93.1 for 1-year-olds to 28.8 for 10-year-olds when compare child of consistent adult safety-belt user with child of less than consistent adult safety-belt user 95 confidence interval overlap for the two young age group i.e. age less than 1 and 1 year report child-occupant restraint use in law state generally exceed that in no-law state regardless of age of child table 1 in addition high adult educational attainment be significantly associate with increase restraint use for child a factor that have also be associate with increase adult safety-belt use 8 report by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the finding in this report be consistent with others indicate that adult who do not use safety belt themselves be less likely to employ occupant restraint for their child 6,9 because these nonbelted adult be at increase risk of crash and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behavior child travel with them may be at great risk for motor-vehicle injury 10 educational attainment of adult respondent be inversely associate with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant-protection program should be promote among parent with low educational attainment because low educational attainment be often associate with low socioeconomic status such program should be offer to adult through health-care facility that serve low-income community or through federal program i.e. head start that be direct at parent with young child injury-prevention program emphasize restrain young child in addition however effort must be intensified to protect child occupant a hicnet medical newsletter page 18 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 they become old parent especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belt and those from state that do not have mandatory safety-belt use law should be encourage to wear safety belt and to protect their child by use approve child safety seat and safety belt finally the increase use of restraint among child may increase their likelihood of use safety belt when they become teenager -- the age group characterize by the low rate of safety-belt use and the high rate of fatal crash 5 reference 1. cdc childhood injury in

alcohol syndrome hip dislocation/dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney/ureter and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however difference in the prevalence of arm/hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy 21 down syndrome be probably not attributable to difference in ascertainment because these defect be relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional difference in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalence of trisomy 21 and spina bifida however the reason for difference in arm/hand reduction be unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation action take because of the similarity of these data base several collaborative

assist reproductive technology follow the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer ivf- et baby in 1978 a host of assist reproductive technology have be developed that include ivf-et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freeze and gamete micromanipulation together these technology be refer to a the high-tech assist reproductive technology art procedure ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or pathology still be the mainstay of the therapy available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always be appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedure therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there be a program of assist reproduction that specializes in art procedure this program serf a a tertiary provider for those patient in the state of arizona whose infertility problem can not be resolve by the traditional therapy the follow article on back describes the art procedure available in our center clarifies appropriate application for each and considers the realistic expectation for their success procedure include be o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf-et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryo and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that be direct towards improve success of these technology hicnet medical newsletter page 24 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 future area of research in addition to ongoing research that be direct exclusively toward the management of infertile couple we be develop the technology to assist couple who be at risk for produce embryo with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subject the biopsied cell to genetic analysis use either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there be recent report of the successful application of dna amplification by other center for example for diagnosis of the gene for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and far focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probe the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counsel patient who exhibit sex-linked disorder the considerable clinical application of such technology lie in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetus in order to avoid the birth of affected child catherine racowsky ph.d. associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona application success rate and advance for the management of infertility the follow be the art procedure available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer be the core art procedure of our assist reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized egg from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryo for 1 or 2 day before they be transfer to the patient 's uterus all culture be maintain in an incubator under strictly control atmospheric and temperature condition before be process for use in insemination semen sample be evaluate in our andrology laboratory use both subjective light microscopy and computer- hicnet medical newsletter page 25 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 assist semen analysis to ensure an adequate number of egg with which to perform ivf-et or indeed gift follicular development be typically stimulate with gonadotropin perganol metrodin gonadotropin release hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and/or gnrh analogue lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf-et be accomplish with egg obtain in non-stimulated cycle while some program utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedate couple who resort to ivf-et exhibit such pathology a tubal deficiency ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and/or mild form of male factor infertility accord to the united state ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf-et nationwide have stabilize at about 14 percent per cycle result from our program involve 86 patient who have undergone 173 ivf-et cycle reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure be disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factor that limit achievement of a high percentage of pregnancy well recognize predictor of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeat ivf-et cycle attempt however among these age be the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it be critical that such patient be refer to an assist reproduction program at the early opportunity follow failure of traditional therapy the underlie basis for the negative effect of age on fertility have not be clearly delineate beyond recognition that 1 the number of egg available for retrieval decline markedly with age 2 fertilization rate significantly decrease in egg retrieve from patient who be over 40 year and 3 provide the appropriate hormonal background be present age be unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore be investigate physiological change in the egg that may be impact by age we have determine that more than 50 percent of egg that fail to fertilize in vitro be chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormality be accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patient be to use egg obtain from a donor our program have initiate recruitment of volunteer egg donor to satisfy the need of a list of recipient interested in this form of therapy gift this high-tech art procedure be perform in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf-et involves introduce sperm and freshly retrieve egg into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of 3 eggs/tube under these circumstance fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess egg be retrieve the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent option for embryo transfer in that cycle or freeze for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure be apply to case in hicnet medical newsletter page 26 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 which there be at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple have such pathology a ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and/or idiopathic infertility the data report in the united state ivf registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with gift be high than that obtain with the ivf-et technique range of clinical pregnancy for gift be 24 to 36 percent and for ivf-et 14 to 18 percent in view of this fact one might expect more patient to be treat with gift than ivf-et however in our program we have take into account three basic concern which while substantially reduce the number of gift cycle perform benefit the patient these concern be 1 the increase cost associate with perform a procedure in the operating room 2 the risk albeit minimal of undergo general anesthesia and 3 the considerable benefit to be accrue from obtain direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the egg and the developmental competency of resultant embryo the increase success with gift undoubtedly reflect the artificial environment provide by the laboratory in the ivf-et procedure between january 1 1991 and december 31 1992 we have perform a total of 12 gift cycle with an overall success rate of 20 percent embryo cryopreservation or freeze be apply in our program when embryo result from residual gift egg or from non-transferred ivf embryo this procedure not only provide patient with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduce cost but also circumvents the legal and ethical issue relate to disposal of supernumerary embryo therefore a stipulate by the american fertility society ethical guideline for art program from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assist reproduction program should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which be still very new be apply to couple who be unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than 10 million sperm/ml in combination with few than 20 perccent motile sperm and/or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology we be currently develop the procedure of sub-zonal insertion szi which entail inject sperm under the coat around the egg the barrier normally penetrate by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi program world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of szi cycle result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitation impose by abnormality inherent in the sperm therefore we be currently focus on the development of improve technique for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such effort be unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offer the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patient to establish conception catherine racowsky ph.d. hicnet medical newsletter page 27 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 associate professor and

their own positive contribution a well however when the nt person have self-image challenge the `` dark-side '' of this personality type usually come out which should be obvious to all a physician who be a strong nt and who have not learn to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like lack of empathy or feel and be very compel to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question know many m.d 's of this temperament and suffice to say i oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent i think they be and

complex way a my doctor explain one of those 'evil orthomolecular specialist i have a blood test three week later and vitamin a be normal he then stop me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi-vitamin supplement and make sure that i maintain a 50,000 iu/day of beta carotene call me carrot face hopefully elaine 's doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplement even reevaluate some supplement take for example niacin in fairly large dosage 1 gram/day which steve dyer have good information about on sci.med.nutrition if niacin only have second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergy then it probably be not worth take such a large dose long-term and risk liver damage though i do now believe base on my successful therapy with sporanox that i definitely have some excessive growth of fungus unknown specie in my sinus i still want to ask the question have there be any study that demonstrate candida `` bloom '' in the sinus with associate sinus irritation sinusitis/rhinitis my sinus irritation reduce significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatment be implement during this time i do not have any noticeable gi track problem before start on sporanox but some for a few day after which then go away consider normal btw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference book sorry remember which one and found an obscure comment date back into the 1950's which state that people can develop contain non-lethal or non-serious aspergillis infestation aspergiliosis of the sinus lead to sinus inflammation symptom i 'll have to dig out that reference again since it be relevant to this discussion my doctor test me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albicans and i show a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test be essentially useless and assume it be true that candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who test a have an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptom such a mucus membrane irritation due to the body 's allergic response a i say in an earlier post one do not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m.d degree or a ph.d. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis btw and i 'll repost this again dr. ivker in his book `` sinus survival '' have routinely give before anything else nizoral a pre-sporanox systemic anti-fungal not a safe and not a good a sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patient if they have be on antibiotic four or more time in the last two year he claim that out of 2000 or so patient well over 90 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptom but it cure it by any mean imply the so-called yeast/fungus infection be not the primary cause but a later complication also found that nystatin whether take internally or put into a sinus spray do not help this implies of course assume that excessive yeast/fungus bloom be aggravate the sinus inflammation that the yeast/fungus have grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact it be not absorbed into the blood stream again i admit lot of 'ifs and 'implies which please the hard-core nt who have to have the double-blind study or a non-issue but one have to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation a strawman if you will this brings up an interest observation use by those who will deny and reject any and all aspect of the 'yeast hypothesis until the appropriate study be do and that be if you observe or culture the yeast `` bloom '' in the gut or sinus then there 's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it be virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that can not be easily observe since candida be everywhere in the body a real catch-22 another catch-22 those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis say that no study have be do actually study have be do but if not up to a certain standard then it be from their perspective a non-study which should not even be consider i agree that the appropriate study should be do and that will take big to do it right however in order to convince the funding agency in these austere time to open their wallet you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposal be paradoxically to do almost the exact study need funding that be you have to do 90 of the study before you even get funding a a scientist at a national lab very aware of this for the small fund project afraid that even if dr. ivker and 100 other doctor get together pool their practice 's case history and anecdote into a compelling picture and approach the funding agency they would get nowhere even if they be able to publish their statistical result it be obvious from the comment by some of the doctor here be that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinus lead to noticeable non-lethal symptom do not exist and be not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case history or compile anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the need study because in their mind a do issue excessive yeast growth lead to diffuse allergic symptom do not will not and can not exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of reminds me of lister ... there also other nutrient necessary to the proper work of the sinus mucus membrane and cilium again the evidence from mycological study indicate that many yeast/fungus specie can grow hypha `` root '' into deep tissue similar to mold grow in bread you can continue to kill the surface such a nystatin do but you kill that which be deeper in the tissue without use a systemic anti-fungal such a itraconazole sporanox or some of the old one such a nizoral which be more toxic and not a effective this be why a have be point out by recent study sent to me by a doctor be in e-mail contact with thanks that nystatin be not effective in the long- term treatment of gi tract `` candidiasis '' like try to weed a garden by cut off what 's above the ground but leave the root ready to come out again once you walk away the 60000 question be whether a contain candida `` bloom '' can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membrane cause some type of symptom in susceptible people e.g. allergy without become `` systemic '' in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not cause any problem and the full-blown systemic infection that be potentially lethal also if one be an 'anal retentive like be diagnose in a prior post that can also provide more site for excessive candida growth a say in private e-mail there be flaw in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapy after the approved/proven/accepted therapy work for example i go to three ent 's who all say that i will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab 's fail they do mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia plug and it would not get to the root cause of my condition after three month of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health have vastly improve to where i be two year ago before my health greatly deteriorate of course skeptic would say that maybe if i do nothing i would have improve anyway but that view be stretch thing quite far because of the experience of the three ent 's i saw who say that just have to `` live with it '' confident i will reach what one could call a total `` cure '' the anti-fungal program i undertook be one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab 's for the last four year note for those have sinus problem may i suggest the book by dr. ivker i mention above be sure to get the revise edition dr. ivker start off have chronic and severe sinus problem and his visit to several ent 's totally floor him when they say `` just have to live with it '' he spent several year try everything standard and non-standard until he be essentially cure of chronic sinusitis he now share his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i be on the road to recovery follow some part of it his one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the begin of treatment if you have a history of anti-biotic overuse have be proven to him time and time again in his own practice sure if i comment to him of the hard-core belief of the anti- '' yeast hypothesis '' poster that he would have definite thing to say such a '' work wonder for me in almost two thousand case '' to put it mildly i also would not be surprised if he would say that they be the one violate their moral obligation to help the patient maybe those doctor who be reading this who have a practice and be confront by a patient have symptom that could be due to the `` hypothetical yeast overgrowth '' e.g. they fit some of the profile the pro-yeast people have identify should consider anti-fungal therapy if all other avenue have be exhaust remember theory and practice be two different thing you can not have one without the other they be synergistic if a doctor do something non-standard yet produce noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patient you at least sit up and take notice maybe you ought to trust what he say and begin hypothesize why it work instead of why it work afraid a lot of doctor have become so enamor with `` scientific correctness '' that they be ignore the patient they have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balance which we see from some of the poster to this group there come a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such a try a good systemic anti-fungal such a sporanox after have exhaust all the other avenue i be one of those who the traditional medical establishment be not able to help so i do the natural thing i go to a couple of doctor 's who be somewhat outside this establishment and a a result i have found significant relief would it not be well if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of be sue or have his license pull can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapy for his/her patient that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapy be ineffective like to hear a doctor tell me '' well try all the therapy that be approve and accepted in this country and since they clearly work for you i now have the authority to use experimental unproven technique that seem to have help others i promise anything and there be some risk you will have to sign something say you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapy and i 'll have to register your case at the state board '' anyway if my ent have suggest this to me i would 've jumped on this pronto instead of go to one of those doctor who for either altruistic reason or for greed be practice these alternative therapy with much risk to him/her risk meaning lose their license and possibly to the patient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also would be morally and ethically well than the current system by show the compassion of the medical community to the patient that do everything it can within reason to help the patient it be the lack of such a mechanism that be lead large number of people to try alternative therapy some of which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all true quackery i well get off my soapbox before this post reach 500k

b"i notice several year ago that when i take analgesic fairly regularly motrin at the time i seem to get a lot of migraine but have forgotten about that until i start reading some of the post here i generally take nsaid or tylenol for headache because found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain source that force me to take nsaid currently naprosyn first be some pelvic pain that i get at the begin of my period and then much bad at midcycle i have have surgery for endometriosis in the past ~12 year ago so the drs tell me that my pain be probably due to the endometriosis come back try synarel it reduce the pain while i take it 3 mo but the pain return immediately after i stop three doctor have suggest hysterectomy a the only `` real solution '' to my problem although i expect to have any more child i like the idea of have my uterus and one remain ovary remove the first ovary be remove when i have the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggest i get a hysterectomy be an expert in laser surgery but perhaps think that type of procedure be only worthwhile on woman who still plan to have child so basically all left with be toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that work and motrin give me horrible gastritis a few year ago so through with it in fact naprosyn work very well at eliminate the pain if i take it regularly a i do when i have severe back pain and pain in both leg a i 'll discus in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it take several hour for it reduce the pain actually quite effective at reduce the pain it just take quite a while in the meantime frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have be chronic low back pain result in bilateral radiculopathy have mri xrays ct scan and emg have 2 of them and intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction test the test have not be conclusive a to what be cause my back and leg pain the mri report both say i have several bulge degeneratig disk and from the xrays and mri i think it be apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan be that there be two herniation l3-l4 and l4-l5 but others hav look at the film and conclude that there be no herniation the second emg and nerve conduction study show significant denervation compare to the first emg oh yeah i have some other horrible test call something like somatic evoke response which show that the '' internal nerve '' be work fine anyway the bottom line be that i sometimes have severe pain in both leg and back pain the back pain be there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain be there i need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i take naprosyn regulary for 6-9 month every time i try to stop the leg pain get bad so always resume since last november i have take it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have be go to physical therapy for the last 8 month 2-3 time a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she have try it earlier but it have cause a lot of pain in my back this time she try it at a low weight after a month or two the pain in my leg begin go away but the traction aways cause discomfort in my low back which could be reduce with ultrasound and massage so now i have nearly a much pain in my leg in fact my therapist take me off traction about 2 week ago get back to my original reason for this post ... even if i can avoid take analgesic for headache i really avoid them entirely because i have other pain source that `` force '' me to use them oh i forgot to mention that it have be suggest to me that i have back surgery but avoid that too i find the migraine difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduce capacity a system engineer and do a lot of reading and write when the pelvic pain be bad i concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minute because the pain be so bothersome when the pain in my back be bad it can cause severe burning in both leg shoot pain in my leg electric shock type of pain in my foot and toe and basically when it get bad i really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesic contribute to the migraine the migraine be more tolerable than the other pain source i get a lot of migraine an average of 3 to 4 a month which last 1-3 day take cafergot the first time the caffiene really get to me so i reduce the dosage but i like the side effect if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist very helpful when i told him my problem with cafergot he say that when sumatriptan becomes available i should try that try several other medication fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either work or i tolerate them so what can i do my doctor 's seem to be satisfied with me just try to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain have some bad experience with surgery my heart stop once from the anesthesia i be told that it be likely the succinylcholine and already have surgery several time anyway the point of what say be that even if analgesic can contribute to migraine some people need to take them to tolerate other pain"

b"to start with no methodology or form of reason be infallible so there 's a question of how much certainty we be willing to pay for in a give context insistence on too much rigor bog science down completely and make progress impossible expenditure of sufficiently large sum of money and amount of time can sometimes overcome this on the other hand with too little rigor much be lose by base work on result which eventually turn out to be false there be a morass of study contradict other study and outsider start say `` you people call this science '' my opinion for what worth be that one see both these phenomenon happen simultaneously in some part of psychology some subjective judgement be require to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation i believe it be ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science my second point though be that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgement about scientific validity even when use methodology consider inadequate by the usual standard i think this be true of many scientist and i think it be true of many who approach their discipline in a way that be not generally recognize a scientific within mathematics i think there be several example especially before the twentieth century one conspicuous case be that of riemann who be famous for many theorem he state but do not prove later mathematician do prove them of course i think that for a good scientist empirical investigation be often not so much a matter of determine what be true and what 's not a it be a matter of convincing other people people have propose lot of incompatible definition of science here but i think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one 's result be an essential element not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but i think that if one be not move toward that goal then one be not do science when a person other than a scientist be quite good at what he do and seem to be very successful at it i think that his judgement be also worthy of respect and that his assertion be well worth far investigation admittedly my question be not at all well pose a considerable amount of effort in a `` serious scholarly investigation '' such a i suggest would be require simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer the `` science '' i be think of in my question be the actual science currently practice now in the last decade of the twentieth century i certainly think of some idealize science or the mere use of `` reason and observation '' one thing i have in mind in my suggestion be the question a to whether in many case the subjective judgement of skilled and experienced practitioner might be more reliable than statistical study since russell turpin seem to be much more familiar than i be with the study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell u if there be any exist research related to this question -- in the argument between behaviorist and cognitivists psychology seem less like a science than a collection of compete religious sect"

b"gee maybe misjudge you russell anyone who agrees with something i say be all bad seriously not sure whether i misjudge you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science be mainly about avoid mistake and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who use method deem `` scientific '' can possibly know what 's true and what 's not okay so let 's see if we agree on this first of all there be degree of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully control trial before we accept a absolute scientific truth to the extent that there be any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment be useful this be often the best evidence we can hope for from investigator who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it make sense to tentatively treat claim a credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientist who be qualify and have the necessary resource can do more careful test secondly it make sense to be more tolerant in our standard of evidence for a pronounce effect than for one that be marginal i come to this dispute about what science be not only a a mathematician but a a veteran of many argument in sci.psychology and occasionally in sci.med about nlp neurolinguistic program much of the work do to date by nlpers can be well categorize a informal exploration than a careful scientific research for year now i have be try to get scientific and clinical psychologist to just take a look at it to read a few of the book and watch some of the videotape courtesy of your local university library not for the purpose of make a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to elicit information from subject and look for idea and hypothesis which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the *questions* nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in sci.pychology be `` if this be thoroughly validate by the accepted form of empirical research then it be of any interest to u '' to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme `` there 've get to be control study '' position be an nlp technique call the fast phobia/trauma cure simple phobia a oppose to agoraphobia may not be the world 's most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them be that it take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone be cure of one the nlp phobia cure be a simple visualization which require less than 15 minute nlpers claim that it can also be use to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence be useful in treat post-traumatic stress syndrome it be essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process use by behavioral therapist a subject only need to be take through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the process need to be repeat and the subject need to practice it over again at home now to me it seem pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if a nlpers claim the success rate be extremely high take someone with a fear of height a i use to have take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response spend 15 minute to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if thing have change check back with them in a few week to see if the cure seem to be last more long term follow-up be certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that last several week have significance in any case there be many know case where the cure have last year to the best of my knowledge there be no know case where the cure have be reverse after hold for a few week my own cure incidentally be do with a slightly different nlp technique before i learn of the fast phobia/trauma cure ten year later now i enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and have a large balcony the folk over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuse not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory -- a study of the sort that nlp practitioner many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them be also just plain not interested because the whole idea seem frivolous and since not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible reward to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia/trauma cure be over ten year old now and the clinical psychology establishment be still say `` we have any way of know that effective '' these academic themselves have the resource to do a study a elaborate a anyone could want of course but they say `` why should i prove your theory '' and `` the burden of proof be on the one make the claim '' one academic in sci.psychology say that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it be described in a scientific journal described in a number of book and post article in sci.psychology describe it in a much detail a capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study have be do with favorable result but apparently not acceptable because a doctoral dissertation and not publish in a refereed journal to me this sort of attitude do not advance science but hinders it this be the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about `` doctrinnaire '' attitude about science now maybe i have be unfair in impute such attitude to you russell if so i apologize -- in the argument between behaviorist and cognitivists psychology seem less like a science than a collection of compete religious sect"

absolutely need to go see a doctor a soon a you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn-out ordeal go see a doctor now your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialist in these kind of problem do n't wait though go see a doctor the remainder of this information be paraphrase without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand 's department of labour occupational safety and health service `` occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner 's guide '' first a glossary or fancy name for how you have your hand note likely to hear these term from doctor and keyboard vendor rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kind of injury oos occupational overuse syndrome -- synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder -- another synonym for rsi wruld

hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction move away from the body overspanning opening the finger out wide now then problem come in two main type local condition and diffuse condition local problem be what expect specific muscle tendon tendon sheath nerve etc be inflame or otherwise hurt diffuse condition often mistaken for local problem can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and/or tingle with identifiable area of tenderness in muscle although not necessarily `` the problem '' -- why do occupational overuse syndrome occur here 's the theory normally your muscle and tendon get blood through capillary which pas among the muscle fiber when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time exert 50 of your full power completely restrict your blood flow without fresh blood your muscle use store energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by-product like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurt all it neighbor tense up perhaps to relieve the load this make sense for your normal sort of injury but it only make thing bad with repetitive motion more tension mean less blood flow and the cycle continue another by-product of the lack of blood flow be tingle and numbness from your nerve they need blood too anyway when type too much never really give a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscle never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make thing bad -- specific injury you may have heard of note most injury come in two flavor acute and chronic acute injury be severely painful and noticable chronic condition have less pronounce symptom but be every bit a real tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity be mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath 's ability to lubricate the tendon a a result the tendon sheath thickens get inflame and get your problem tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon repeat tense of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fiber of the tendon start separate and can even break leave behind debris which induces more friction more swell and more pain `` sub-acute '' tendonitis be more common which entail a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it get bad with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome -- the nerve that run through your wrist into your finger get trap by the inflame muscle around them symptom include feel `` pin and needle '' tingle numbness and even loss of sensation ct be often confuse for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension -- also know a 'neural tension this be where the nerve run down to your arm have become contract and possibly compress a a result of muscle spasm in the shoulder and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed a or associate with one of the other oos disorder it be largely reversible and can be treat with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretch and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body there 's a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be get an idea of how oos condition occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctor misdiagnose problem a carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem always get a second opinion before somebody do something drastic to you like surgery ==4== type posture ergonomics prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery be to reduce tension in the muscle and tendon this require learn how to relax if under a load of stress this be doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relax should become a guide principle in your work every three minute take a three second break every three minute take a three second break really do it every three minute also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep and relaxation be really a big deal there be all kind of other treatment of course drug can reduce inflamation and pain custom-molded splint can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problem exercise can help strengthen your muscle regular stretch can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduce tension ice or hot-cold contrast bath also reduce swell only your doctor can say what 's best for you -- posture -- here be some basic guideline i so like the way this be write in the new zealand book that lift it almost verbatim from appendix 10 -- dwallach let your shoulder relax let your elbow swing free keep your wrist straight pull your chin in to look down flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try lean back in the chair slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every 20 minute get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your foot should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thigh near the knee and your thigh should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that it height be comfortable to work at if you be short this may be impossible the beest remedy be to raise the seat height and prevent your leg from dangle by use a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttock fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust it tilt to give firm support in this area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time lean back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair make a big difference if you like your chair go find a well one you really want adjustment for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rest seem to get in the way although some more expensive chair have height adjustable arm rest which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chair -- pick one right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend `` just chair '' the name say it all -- keyboard drawer wrist pad and keyboard replacement there be a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for some people wrist pad seem to work wonder however with good posture you be rest your wrist on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be `` right there '' if you drop your arm at your side and then lift your hand up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hand when your elbow be at about 90 degree of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all cost wrist pad may or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax often easy for somebody else to notice your hunch shoulder or deviate hand some argue that the normal flat keyboard be antiquate and poorly design a number of replacement be available on the market today check out the accompany

b"i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast have progress steve dyer and i have be exchange word over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attack a woman poster for be treat by a liscenced physician for a disease that do not exist call this physician a quack be reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others be do it here a well let me tell you who the quack really be these be the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with environment and how that balance can be alter by diet and antibiotic these be the physician who dismiss their patient with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yell quack could it just be professional jealousy i help elaine or jon but somebody else do could they know more than me no way they must be a quack be teach a human nutrition course for medical student for over ten year now and guess who the most receptive student be those that be raise on farm and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animal and those student who have make a dramatic diet change prior to enter medical school switch to the vegan diet typically this be about 1/3 of my class of 90 student those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop come to class okay because i know that some of what teach be go to stick and there will be at least a few `` enlighten '' physician practice in the u.s. really too bad that most u.s. medical school cover nutrition because if they do candida would not be view a a non-disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal be reinnoculated with `` good '' bacteria after antibiotic be stop medicine have decide that since human do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with `` good '' bacteria be need after come off a braod spectrum antibiotic human have all kind of different organism living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinus vagina and on the skin these be nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system be compromise they be also call nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organism that cause human disease they do not produce toxin a they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organism will be consider pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a be mainly responsible for set up this barrier steve get real upset with elaine 's doctor because he be use anti-fungals and vitamin a for her gi problem if steve really understoood what vitamin a do in the body he would not or at least should not be call elaine 's doctor a quack here be a brief primer on yeast yeast infection a they be commonly call be not truely cause by yeast the most common organism responsible for this type of infection be candida albicans or monilia which be actually a yeast-like fungus an infection cause by this organism be call candidiasis candidiasis be a very rare occurance because like an e. coli infection it require that the host immune system be severly depressed candida be frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membrane of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predispose factor be present such a a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotic have be use in diabetic their secretion contain much high amount of glucose candida unlike bacteria be very limited in food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it get access to a lot of glucose it bloom and over ride the other organism living with it in the sinus gi tract or vagina in diabetic skin lesion can also foster a good bloom site for these little bugger the bloom be usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this be an allergic like reaction to the candida or not certain when the bloom be in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy see and some doctor do then try to `` treat '' it if internal only symptom can be use and these symptom be pretty nondiscript candida be kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinus the gi tract mouth stomach and intestine and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally do not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organism unless they broach the mucus membrane `` barrier '' if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most american be not get enough vitamin a from their diet about 30 of all american 's die with less vitamin a than they be born with u.s. autopsy study while this low level of vitamin a do not cause pathology blindness it do impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predispose factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetic can suffer from a candida `` bloom '' the most common cause of this type of bloom be the use of broad spectrum antibiotic which knock down many different kind of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida a far a food be concerned while drug be available to handle candida many patient find that their doctor will not use them unless there be evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti-fungal drug do warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation be suspect to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic be the smoking gun then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just a the anti-fungal cream be an appropriate treatment for recur vaginal yeast infection in spite of what mr. steve dyer say but even in patient be give the anti-fungals the irritation cause by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment be discontinue unless the underlie cause of the problem be address lack of a `` good '' bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus be the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from name it be an acid love organism and it set up an acidic condition be it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l. acidophilius be the predominate bacteria unless you be hit with broad spectrum antibiotic in the gi system the ano-rectal region seem to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many woman creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive way to minimmize this transfer be to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swell pain and even blood discharge make many patient think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move far up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood be what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive test he told her that there be nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan have told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood test in stool specimen to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positive candida bloom guy if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fix yes nice to know that i have colon cancer but what then be cause my distress when i finally find a doctor who treat me and get me 90 well steve dyer call him a quack candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman 's period and this be often when candida bloom in the vagina vinegar and water douche be the best way of deal with vaginal problem many woman have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before try this my wife have this vagina problem after go on birth control pill and search for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solve the problem rather than just writting script for anti-fungal cream this be a woman gynocologist who have have the same problem recur vaginal yeast infection this m.d do some dig and come up with an acetic acid and l. acidophilis douche which she use in your office to keep it sterile after three treatment sex return to our marraige i have often wonder what an m.d with chronic gi distress or sinus problem would do about the problem that he tell his patient be a non-existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria l. acidophilus be an acid produce bacteria which be the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy woman if take orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol spray it have also be use to innoculate the sinus membrane but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system need to be strengthen this be accomplish by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b-complex vitamin diet survey repeatedly show that american be not get enough b6 and folate these be probably the segement of the population that will have the great problem with this non-existent disorder candida bloom after antibiotic therapy some of the above material be obtain from `` natural heal '' by mark bricklin publish by rodale press a well a note from my human nutrition course i will be post a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a play in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in deal with candida bloom another effective dietary treatment be to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this be especially important if the gi system be involve if candida can not get glucose not go to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acid and fatty acid for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate be return to the gut if steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accost a poster who be seek advice about her doctor 's use of vitamin a and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seek advice from newsnet should not be treat this way those of u give of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart 's
