'' which mean I be refer to Christian doctrine a I understand it if I be speak for myself you 'll know it My purpose in post be to present a basic overview of Christain doctrine since it seem germane Bill with those who pretend not to know what be be say and what it mean When atheist claim that they do -not- know if God exists and do n't know what He want they contradict the Bible which clearly say that -everyone- know The authority of the Bible be it claim to be ... should I repeat what I write above for the sake of get it across You may trust the Bible but your trust it doesn't make it any more credible to me If the Bible say that everyone know that 's clearly reason to doubt the Bible because not everyone `` know '' your allege god 's allege existance Again I be paraphrase Christian doctrine which be very clear on this point your dispute be not with me ... Bill refute while the species-wide condemnation be justified Those that claim that there be no evidence for the existence of God or that His will be unknown must deliberately ignore the Bible the ignorance itself be no excuse 1 No they do n't have to ignore the Bible The Bible be far from universally accepted The Bible be NOT a proof of god it be only a proof that some people have thought that there be a god Or do it prove even that They might have be write it a series of fiction short-stories As in the case of Dionetics Assuming the writer believe it the only thing it could possibly prove be that they believe it And that 's ignore the problem of whether or not all the interpretation and Biblical-philosophers be correct 2 There be people who have truly never heard of the Bible 3 Again read the FAQ 1 Here again you miss the point The Bible itself be not the point it 's what it contains It make no difference who accpets the Bible or even who 's unaware of it existence Christians hold that it applies universally because mankind share the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of God 2 See above 3 If you read my post with same care a read the FAQ we would n't be have this conversation Bill freedom You be free to ignore God in the same way you be free to ignore gravity and the consequence be inevitable and well know in both case That an atheist ca n't accept the evidence mean only Bzzt ... wrong answer Gravity be directly THERE It do n't stop exert a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it God on the other hand do n't generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloid God do n't exert a rationally undeniable influence Gravity be obvious god be n't As I say the evidence be there you just do n't accept it here at least we agree Bill Secondly human reason be very comforatble with the concept of God so much so that it be in itself intrinsic to our nature Human reason always come back to the question of God in every generation and in No human reason have n't always come back to the existance of `` God '' it have usually come back to the existance of `` god '' In other word it do n't generally come back to the xtian god it come back to whether there be any god And in much of oriental philosophic history it generally do n't pop up a the idea of a god so much a the question of what natural force be and which one be out there From a world-wide view human nature just make u wonder how the universe come to be and/or what force s be currently in control A natural tendancy to believe in `` God '' only exists in religious wishful think Yes human reason do always come back to the existence of God we're have this discussion be we not Bill I say all this to make the point that Christianity be eminently reasonable that Divine justice be just and human nature be much different than what atheist think it be Whether you agree or not YOU certainly be not correct on human nature You be at the least base your view on a completely eurocentric approach Try look at the outside world a well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity Well this be interest Truth be to be determine by it politically correct content Granted it 's extremely unhip to be a WASP male and anything European be contemptable but I thought this kind of dialogue the purpose of a.a be to get at the truth of thing But then I remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and I understand

And also not the position of the subjectivist a have be point out to you already by others Ditch the strawman already and see my reply to Mike Cobb 's root message in the thread Societal Basis for Morality I 've respond over there BTW I do n't intend this a a strawman but a something logically entail by relativism really any ethical system where value be assume to be unreal It 's different to say `` Relativists say ...

Dan Schaertel dp nasa.kodak.com write Let u go back oh say 1000 year or so whatever Pretend someone say to you someday there will be men on the moon Now remember you still think the world be flat This be quite an extraordinary claim I think C.S Lewis have argue that medieval people do not all think the world be flat However this argument go both way Pretend someone tell Plato that it be highly probable that people do not really have soul their mind and their consciousness be just something their brain make up and their brain their body be actually ahead of their mind even in voluntarly action I do n't think Plato would have be happy with this and neither would Paul although Paul 's idea be quite different However if you would _read_ what we discus in this group and not just preach you would see that there currently be much evidence in favour of these statement The same applies to the theory of natural selection or other sacred cow of Christianity on our origin and human nature I do n't believe in spirit devil or immortal soul any more than in god The fact be we can argue the existence of God until the end of time there really be no way to either prove or disprove it but there will be a time when we all know the truth I hope and believe I 'm right and I hope and pray that you find your way too Ah you say it You believe what you want to This be what I have assume all along OK maybe I should n't have say `` no way '' I guess I really believe there be a way But all I can do be plant seed Either they grow or they do n't You might be a well plant Satan 's seed ever thought of this Besides you have n't yet explain why we must believe so blindly without any guide light at all at least I have n't notice it I do n't think this be at all fair play on god 's part Your argument sound like a version of Pascal 's Wager Please read the FAQ this fallacy be discuss there But they wo n't if they 're not plant The Holy Spirit be the nurishment that help them grow and that come from God And I fail to get help from the HS because I have a wrong attitude Sorry Dan but I do not think this spirit exists People who claim to have access to it just look badly delude not gift Petri

In article 116547 bu.edu jaeger buphy.bu.edu Gregg Jaeger writes Yes The Qur'an discus this point in several way some of them quite directly For example it say that if God _were_ to appear them there would be no need for faith and belief a the evidence would be definitive Ah Excellent So why do n't she appear to me I 'm a little weak in the blind faith department Besides she do n't even really need to appear how about oh say a little tip something like `` put your all on 3 in the 7:30 at the Dog Races '' ... perhaps in a dream or vision How do we know that Muhammed do n't just go out into the desert and smoke something Would a person who be high write so well and with such consistency I 'm afraid I do n't know arabic I have only read translation I wouldn't know it if it be well-written Consistent though be one thing the Quran be not And have *you* read it in arabic Besides some of my best write have be do under the influence of shall we say consciousness alter substance And how do we know that the scribe he dictate the Quran to do n't screw up or put in their own little verse They 'd have to be very good to do so without destroy the beauty and literary quality of text Arabic text Yes so How do we know they *weren't* very good Again assume that the Quran be beautfully write And why can Muhammed marry more than four woman when no other muslim be allow to Muhammad do not exceed the number _after_ the revelation regulate the number of wife a man could marry but before it Ok I retract this point Although I might still say that once he knew he should have do something about it Although I think the big insult to Islam be that the majority of it follower would want to suppress a book sight unseen on the say-so of some `` holy '' guy Not to mention murder the author I agree But be it really true that this be the case I have n't interviewed all muslim about this I would really like it if this be false But I ca n't take it on your say-so what be your source Another case of judging principle on the basis of those who claim to follow them What other basis do we have to judge a system Especially when we ca n't get a consistent picture of what Islam `` really '' be Do I believe Khomeini Do I go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey Or perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran Ok whose translation And what about thing like `` And wherever you find idolators kill them '' -s

FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY by Robert E. McElwaine Physicist Ninety to a hundred year ago everybody `` knew '' that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly It would violate the `` law '' of physic All of the `` expert '' and `` authority '' say so For example Simon Newcomb declare in 1901 `` The demonstration that no possible combination of know substance know form of machinery and know form of force can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distance through the air seem to the writer a complete a it be possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be '' Fortunately a few SMART people such a the Wright Brothers do NOT accept such pronouncement a the final word Now we take airplane for grant except when they crash Today orthodox physicist and other `` scientist '' be say similar thing against several kind of 'Free Energy Technologies use negative term such a `` pseudo-science '' and `` perpetual motion '' and cite so-called `` law '' which assert that `` energy can not be create or destroyed '' `` 1st law of thermodynamics '' and `` there be always a decrease in useful energy '' `` 2nd law of thermodynamics '' The physicist do not know how to do certain thing so they ARROGANTLY declare that those thing can not be do Such PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE be COMMON in orthodox modern `` science '' and help to cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox modern theory Free Energy Inventions be device which can tap a seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe with- OUT burning any kind of fuel make them the PERFECT SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and it associate pollution degradation and depletion of the environment Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy source by various form of induction UNLIKE solar or wind device they need little or no energy storage capacity because they can tap a much energy a need WHEN need Solar energy have the DIS-advantage that the sun be often block by cloud tree building or the earth itself or be reduce by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitude and high latitude Likewise wind speed be WIDELY VARIABLE and often non-existent Neither solar nor wind power be suitable to directly power car and airplane Properly design Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitation For example at least three U.S. patent 3,811,058 3,879,622 and 4,151,431 have so far be award for motor that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS seemingly tap into energy circulate through the earth 's magnetic field The first two require a feedback network in order to be self-running The third one a described in detail in `` Science Mechanics '' magazine Spring 1980 `` Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor '' by Jorma Hyypia page 45-48 114-117 and front cover require critical size shape orientation and spacing of magnet but NO feedback Such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one 's home YEAR ROUND FOR FREE Complete descriptive copy of U.S. patent be 3.00 each from the U.S. Patent Office 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy.

Larson developed a comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe which he call the 'Reciprocal System which he describes in detail in several book such a `` Nothing But Motion '' 1979 and `` The Universe of Motion '' 1984 in which the physical universe have TWO DISTINCT HALVES the material half and an anti-matter half with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing between them with-OUT the `` heat death '' predict by thermodynamic `` law '' His Theory explains the universe MUCH BETTER than modern orthodox theory include phenomenon that orthodox physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about and be SELF-CONSISTENT in every way Some Free Energy Devices might be tap into that energy flow seemingly convert `` low-quality energy '' into `` high-quality energy '' Also certain religious organization such a 'Sant Mat and 'Eckankar teach their Members that the physical universe be only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major level of existence like parallel universe or analogous to TV channel a described in book like `` The Path of the Masters '' by Dr. Julian Johnson 1939 and `` Eckankar The Key to Secret Worlds '' by Sri Paul Twitchell 1969 For example the next level up from the physical universe be commonly call the 'Astral Plane Long-time Members of these group have learn to 'Soul Travel into these high world and report on condition there It seem plausible that energy could flow down from these high level into the physical universe or be create at the boundary between them give the right configuration of matter to channel it This be support by many successful laboratory-controlled experiment in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world such a those described in the book `` Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain '' In term of economics the market have FAILED Inventors do not have enough money and other resource to fully develop and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment and the conventional energy producer have no desire to do so because of their VE TED INTERE T The government be need to intervene If the government do not intervene then the total supply of energy resource from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out price for energy will increase and pollution and it harmful effect include the 'GREENHOUSE EFFECT acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spill rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue to increase The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development of Free Energy by Inventors and university subsidize private production until the producer can make it on their own and subsidize consumption by low-income consumer of Free Energy Hardware The long-range effect of such government intervention would be wide-spread and profound The quantity of energy demand from conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie and country electric utilitie etc would drop to near zero force their employee to seek work elsewhere Energy resource coal uranium oil and gas would be left in the ground Prices for conventional energy supply would also drop to near zero while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high but drop a supply increase a happen with VCR 's personal computer etc. Costs of produce product that require large quantity of energy to produce would decrease along with their price to consumer Consumers would be able to realize the `` opportunity cost '' of pay electric utility bill or buying home heating fuel Tourism would benefit and increase because traveler would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their car Government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuel would have to be obtain in some other way AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR Many conventional energy producer would go out of business but society a a whole and the earth 's environment and ecosystem would benefit greatly It be the People that government should serve rather than the big corporation and bank For more information answer to your question etc. please consult my CITED SOURCES patent article book UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this IMPORTANT Information be ENCOURAGED

course of action Or be you just set up a strawman I 'm not set up a strawman at all If you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative be to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait False dichotomy Diplomatic alternative include sanction be ineffective That 's because they be n't even attempt But what about those who do n't support Hitler 's dream of conquest It's not a if they democratically vote for all his policy The NSDAP get 43 in the election of 1933 and that be the last chance the German people get to vote on the matter They suffer along with the rest Why do this bother you so much You want to know why it bother me that thousand of innocent people be maim or kill by bombing at the end of WW2 when it be far from clear that such bombing be necessary The world be full of evil and circumstance be not perfect Many innocent suffer due to the wrongful action of others It it regretable but that 's The-Way-It-Is And why-is-it-that-way Who set thing up to be that way this be happen before the Gulf War Why do n't we send in the bomber to East Timor Why be n't we send in the bomber NOW Probably because we 're not the savior of the world We ca n't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another No just the one that have oil Or the one that look like they might make a success of Communism Nor be we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or some other place I do n't see that get UN force to East Timor be any harder than get them to Iraq Tibetan people be round up torture and execute Amnesty International recently report that torture be still widespread in China Why be n't we stop them In fact why be we actively suck up to them by trading freely with them Tell me how we could stop them and I 'll support it I for one do not agree with the present US policy of `` suck up to them '' a you put it I agree that it be deplorable Fine Write to your Congressman and to President Clinton China 's status a '' Most Favoured Nation '' come up for renewal in June Point out that the US should n't be offering favourable trading term to such a despicable regime I doubt anything will happen Clinton 's keener on trade sanction against Europe Unbelievable comment about the Rodney King case delete The medium be not totally monolithic Even though there be a prevail liberal bias program such a the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balance and fair reporting of the news There be even conservative source out there if you know where to look Hurrah for Rush Any idea how many kill file you just end up in I an atheist be argue against kill innocent people You a suppose Christian be argue that it 's OK to kill innocent people so long a you get some guilty one a well Hardly I do n't say that it 's a Good Thing tm to kill innocent people if the end be just Unfortunately we do n't live in a perfect world and there be no perfect solution If one be go to resist tyranny then innocent people on both side be go to suffer and die I do n't say it be OK -- it be unfortunate but sometimes necessary The end justify the mean eh You have criticise moral relativism in the past be now argue that I be in no position to judge the morality of allied action at the end of the War You certainly be not in such a position if you be a moral relativist The same tire old misunderstand Moral relativism mean that there be no *objective* standard of morality It do n't mean you ca n't judge other people 's moral Christ on a bike how many time have we try to hammer that into your head Where 's your Christian love Where 's your absolute morality Oh how quick you be to discard them when it suit you As Ivan Stang would say `` Jesus would puke '' One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum I understand the full ramification of that and I be prepared to do so I do n't believe that you can make the same claim Obviously not a I be an atheist I do n't think you 'd get on with Jesus though he be a long-haired lunatic peace-nik be he not And BTW the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany be because you be bemoan the Iraqi civilian casualty a be `` so deplorable '' Yet blanket bombing be institute because bombing be n't accurate enough to hit industrial/military target in a decisive way by any other method at that time But in the Gulf War precision bombing be the norm So the point be why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualty that result *in spite of* precision bombing when so many more civilian proportionately and quantitatively die under the blanket bombing in WW2 Right Unfortunately for you it turn out that my opinion on the matter be entirely consistent in that I condemn the bombing of Dresden too I think you 're be a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy too You make it sound a though we be aim for military target and could only get them by destroy civilian building next door As I understand it that be not the case we aim deliberately at civilian target in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people civilian suffer But less civilian suffer in this war than any other iany other in history Oh come on With war like the Falklands fresh in people 's mind that sort of propaganda be n't go to fool anyone The story of `` hundred of thousand '' of Iraqi civilian dead be just plain bunk Yes bunk The US lose 230,000 serviceman in WW2 over four year and the majority of them be directly involve in fight Yes And what about the million of casualty the Russians suffer It's hardly surprising the US do n't lose many men in WW2 give that you turn up late

dcs.warwick.ac.uk simon dcs.warwick.ac.uk Simon Clippingdale writes Alarming amount of agreement delete I make my statement about Ockums Razor from my experience in physic Thanks for info in Baysian statistic very interest and I didn't know it before I follow your proof but I have one question We have two hypothesis H and HG the latter be more `` complicate '' which by definition mean P H P HG That `` complicate '' be n't in fact where P H P HG come from it 's more the other way around It 's from P H P HG P HG where G be the complement of G and by axiom P anything 0 so P HG 0 so P H P HG In a sense HG be necessarily more `` complicate '' than H for any H and G so I may be splitting hair but what I 'm try to say be that irrespective of subjective impression of how complicate something be P H P HG hold with equality if and only if P HG 0 As you point out it 's a very simple matter to show P x H P x HG == P H x P HG x and thus H be to be preferd to HG Now to say that H be a consistent with the data a HG be to say P x H P x HG Can you elaborate some on this Well `` P x A P x B '' mean that x be a likely to be observe if A be operative a it be if B be operative This implies that observe x do not provide any useful information which might allow u to discriminate between the respective possibility that A and B be operative the difference reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probability P A and P B P x A P x B == P A x k P A and P B x k P B where k P x A P x P x B P x So A and B be `` equally consistent with the data '' in that observe x do n't give any pointer a to which of A or B be operative In the particular case where A H and B HG however we know that their prior probability be order by P H P HG although we do n't know the actual value and it 's this which allows u to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG Also in the `` real world '' it be n't a clear cut and dry it seem to me We ca n't always determine whether the equality `` P x H P x HG '' be true That 's certainly true but the particular point here be whether or not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spread the word Now it seem to me a I 've say that the observe variance in religious belief be well account for by the memetic transmission model but rather *less* well if one proposes a divine component in addition since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among belief Thus my *personal* feel be that P x HG isn't even equal to P x H in this case but be small H be memetic transmission G be divine component x be the variance among belief But I happily acknowledge that this be a subjective impression BTW my beef with your Baysian argument be not a mathematical one I checked most of your work and do n't find an error and you seem very careful so there probably be n't a `` math mistake '' I think the mistake be philosophical But just to make sure I understand you can please rephrase it in non-technical term I think this be a reasonable request I always try to look for way of explain physic to non-physicist I 'm not a Baysian statistician nor any type of statistician so this would be very helpful Not that I 'm a statistician a such either but The idea be that both theism and atheism be compatible with all of the read my observation to date However theism of the type with which I be concerned *also* suggests that for instance prayer may be answer people may be miraculously heal both be in principle amenable to statistical verification and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable way This mean that these region of the space of possible observation which I loosely term `` appearance of god/s '' have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic Since there be only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expends on make `` appearance of god/s '' possible must come from somewhere else i.e other possible observation All else be equal this mean that an observation which *isn't* an '' appearance of god/s '' must have a slightly high probability under atheism than under theism The Bayesian stuff implies that such observation must cause my run estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a correspond decrease in my run estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis Sorry if that 's still a bit jargonesque but it 's rather difficult to put it any other way since it do depend intimately on the property of conditional probability density and particularly that the total area under them be always unity An analogy may or may not be helpful Say that hypothesis A be `` the coin be fair '' and that B be `` the coin be unfair two-headed '' I've use A and B to avoid confusion with H head and T tail Then P H A 0.5 total 1 P T A 0.5 P H B 1 total 1 P T B 0 The observation be a string of head with no tail This be compatible with both a fair coin A and a two-headed coin B However the probability expend by A on make possible the appearance of tail even though they do n't actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it come in this case from the probability of the appearance of head Say our run estimate at time n-1 be e n-1 A and e n-1 B The observation x n at time n be another head x n H. The estimate be modify accord to P H A e n A e n-1 A -- -- -- -- e n-1 A m P H and P H B e n B e n-1 B -- -- -- -- e n-1 B 2m P H Now we do n't know P H the *actual* prior probability of a head but the multiplier for e A be half that for e B This be true every time the coin be toss and a head be observe Thus whatever the initial value of the estimate after n head we have n e n A m e 0 A and n e n B 2m e 0 B and since e k A e k B 1 at any time k you can show that 0.5 m 1 and thus 1 2m 2 Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase even though both hypothesis be compatible with a string of head The loose analogy be between `` unfair coin '' and atheism and between `` fair coin '' and theism with observation consistent with both A tail which would falsify `` unfair coin '' be analogous to an `` appearance of god/s '' which would falsify atheism I be *not* claim that the analogy extends to the numerical value of the various probability just that the principle be the same Constant observation of no evidence for god if evidence for them ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ be at all possible under the respective theism constantly increase ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the notional estimate probability that they do n't exist It 's important to draw a distinction between theism that could be support or not support by evidence and theism that ca n't Given a theism for which evidence be in principle not possible it do n't make sense to say `` lack of evidence '' support the contrary view Quite so but this type of theism be what I might call `` the G in the HG '' in term of our Ockham 's Razor discussion and I 'd bin it on those ground So it depends upon your conception of this god If it 's a conception like Zeus who happen to come down to earth to `` play '' quite frequently then I agree with you lack of evidence for this conception of god be evidence that it do not exist But if your conception of God be one that do not make falsifiable prediction see below on `` falsifiable prediction '' then I disagree -- lack of evidence do not support a disbelief The hypothesis do n't have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model the theism be n't falsifiable ... I use the phrase `` SHOULD obverse '' Given any specific x theism do not make the prediction `` P x Ht 0 '' That 's why I use the word `` should '' theism make no prediction about any specific event I can only say `` I believe '' that God do such and such after such and such happens or `` I believe God will '' do such and such But for any give x I can never a priori say P x Ht 0 I can not even say this for the set of all x or some x This be what do n't like about your use of probability We also have no way of assign these probability I hold science to positivistic criterion if someone can not tell me how to measure even in principle P x H then probability be not applicable to hypothesis H. Such be the case when H Ht theistic and Ha atheistic For example P x Ha P x Ha /P Ha What be P Ha How do I measure it You do n't have to We do n't need in the above analogy to know *any* prior probability to deduce that the update multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis be less than unity and that the correspond multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis be great than unity You do n't need to know the initial value of the run estimate either It 's clear that after a large number of observation P fair-coin approach zero and P two-headed-coin approach unity All you need to know be whether P x Ha be large than P x Ht for observe x and this follow from the assumption that there be certain event render *possible* not necessary under Ht which be not possible under Ha and all else be equal Baysian statistic relies upon a series of observation But what if the hypothesis be n't amenable to observation And even for statement that be amenable to observation some observation be not relevant -- a sequence of observation must be chosen with care I 'm curious to know what type of observation x 1 x 2 ... you have in mind concern theism and atheism Any observation you like it really do n't matter nor affect the reason provide that there be some possible observation which would count a `` appearance of god/s '' Examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation But any statement about P x H for general x still count a a prediction of H. If the theism in question Ht say that prayer may be answer or that miracle may happen see my interpretation quote again above of what God exists mean then this be a prediction P x Ht 0 for such x It 's what distinguishes it from the atheist hypothesis Ha which predicts that this stuff do not happen P x Ha 0 for such x Theism do not make the claim that `` P x Ht 0 for such x '' Or I should say that my `` theism '' do n't Maybe I be too quick to say we have a common language You say that by the existence of God you `` mean the notion that the deity described by the Bible and by Christians *does* interact with the universe a claimed by those agent '' I agree with this However I must be careful here I BELIEVE this I 'm not make any claim Maybe I should have change *does* to *can* there be an important shift of emphasis But any way since I `` only '' have a belief I can not conclude `` P x Ht 0 for such x '' OK we 'll downgrade `` *does* interact '' to `` *may* interact '' which would actually be well since `` do interact '' implies a falsifiability which we both agree be misplace I do n't think my theism make `` prediction '' Maybe I 'm not understand what you mean by `` prediction '' could you explain what you mean by this word I 'll explain but bear in mind that this be n't central all I require of a theism be that it *not* make the prediction `` Appearances of god/s will never happen '' a do atheism Before somebody point out that quantum mechanic do n't make this prediction either the difference be that QM and atheism do not form a partition Predictions include such statement a `` Prayer be efficacious '' imply '' If you do the stats you will find that Prayer be efficacious '' or `` Prayer be *not* efficacious '' or `` Verily I say unto you This generation shall not pas till all these thing be fulfil '' I do n't think we have any problem of misunderstand here Persistent observation of this stuff not happen *consistent* with Ht though it may be be *more* consistent with Ha a explain in the Bayesian stats post Even if Ht `` God exists '' be unfalsifiable that's no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number of observation go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically BTW I do not consider an argument that require an infinite number of observation a valid or rather that part of the argument be not valid We a exist human can never make an infinite number of measurments and any conclusion that reilies on this I do n't accept a valid That 's fine I do n't claim that theism be false merely that the finite number of observation available to me so far suggest that it be and that a I continue to observe the suggestion look well and well Renormalization stuff delete In the Bayesian stats post I assume that theism be indeed unfalsifiable in a finite number of observation Here 's the relevant quote The important assumption be that there be *some* observation which be compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist hypothesis and thus would falsify atheism these be what I call appearance of god/s but this need not be take too literally Any observation which require for it explanation that one or more god exist will count All other observation be assume to be compatible with both hypothesis This leaf theism a unfalsifiable and atheism a falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearance of god/s Here be my problem with this For something to be falsifiable it must make the prediction that x should not be see If x be see then the hypothesis have be falsify Now atheism be a word in oposition to something theism A theism aserts a belief and an atheism aserts a disbelief So there be certain atheism that be certainly falsifiable just a there be certain theism that be falsifable e.g if my theism asserts the world be only 6,000 year old and that God do not decieve then this have be falsify However the atheism that be in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism be also unfalsifiable I could be wrong on this statment ... contd I think you be an `` appearance of god/s '' be sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the correspond theism be unfalsifiable I 'll think more about it Until then here be a general question Suppse X be unfalsifiable Is not X also unfalsifiable No by way of a counterexample let X `` the coin be fair '' or more accurately so that not X make sense `` the two side of the coin be different '' This be unfalsifiable by toss the coin even a string of head be consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of toss to falsify X in the limit Its converse be falsifiable and be falsify when at least one head and at least one tail have appear This be partly what 's wrong with you Baysian argument which require observation x 1 ... x n to be make There be simply no such observation that have a truth value in relation to the statement `` God exists '' Now by use of your symmetry argument I can understand why someone would say `` Since the statement 'God do not exist' ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ make no prediction I will choose not to believe it '' But none the less this would be found on a type of faith or if you don't like the word faith insert `` belief for which there be no falsifiable evidence '' instead I 'll assume you meant God exists up there at the highlight But by our agree definition of `` exists '' the statement make prediction a I say above although it be n't falsifiable in a finite number of observation Actually I mean 'God do not exist make no prediction Oops Sorry Mea culpa The truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you be refer to But I can think of some conception of God for which it be true But once again I 'm open to the posibility that I could be wrong So give me some example of prediction of the statment `` God do not exist '' Here be one that I can think of If true then there would be no heal or miricles But this can in principle never be determine one way or the other There be case in which people seem to recover and be heal without the help of a doctor and for no know reason These situation do in fact happen They be consistent with a theistic hypothesis but IN NO WAY support such a hypothesis We agree here They be not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis I can't think of one `` prediction '' from 'God do not exist that be n't of this type But I might be miss something `` The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992 '' Said Rapture would have falsify atheism to my satisfaction have it happen although it failure to happen do not of course falsify any theism other than those which specifically predict it `` No phenomenon which require the existence of one or more god for it explanation will ever be observe '' That about sum the whole thing up bob singleton bob thnext.mit.edu Cheers Simon

As much a anything else you learn How do you choose what to believe and what not to I could argue that George Washington be a myth He never live because I don't have any proof except what I be told However all the major event of the life of Jesus Christ be fortold hundred of year before him Neat trick uh How be this There be nothing more disgust than Christian attempt to manipulate/interpret the Old Testament a be fill with sign for the come of Christ Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood be autmoatically interpret a the Cross What a miscarriage of philology There be no way to get into a sceptical heart You can not say you have give a sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have You must TRUST not just go to church and participate in it 's activity Were you ever willing to die for what you believe Well since we have skeptical heart thank goodness there be no way to get into u Here we have the irreconcilable difference Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub trust/belief/faith without knowledge If I be lucky one day and I happen to be think of God at the same time my enkephalin go up then I may associate this a a sign of God it will `` feel '' right and I will trust without know Maybe Religosity do not seem to be anything that be conclusively arrive at but rather it seem to be more of a sudden affliction ... I believe many of u be willing to die for what we believe many of u be not The question be be suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or healthy morality IT would seem not to be The same thing could reflect fanaticism for example and be any case an expression of simple selfishness -- -- Adam

kmr4 po.CWRU.edu Keith M. Ryan writes I do n't think so Although some form of execution be painful the electric chair look particularly so I think the pain be relatively short-lived Drawing and quarter on the other hand look very painful and the victim would n't die right away he 'd bleed to death I 'd imagine Ah so a cruel punishment be not just if it be painful a you origionally state It be about long term pain eg non short-lived Why this sudden chance in your stance I do n't think I 've change my stance at all My original stance be that a painless execution be not a cruel one I do n't say what would be consider cruel only that a painless death be n't Now cruelty must involve some sort of suffer I believe I do n't think someone that get shot in the head or electrocute really suffers very much Even a hang probably produce one sharp instance of pain but it 's over so quickly ... Hmmmmm Pardon Could it be that a counter example have be make which render your previous stance null and void Why do n't you admit that your previous stance be incorrect Or if you somehow manage to slip up and misstate your origional stance why not admit it No Well again I state that a painless death be n't cruel but I don't think I state that all painful execution *are* cruel I think that some be cruel depend on the nature and duration of the pain By the way how long be too long Anything more than an instant I guess Any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think this include the gas chamber and draw and quarter I 'd say that any pain that last say over twenty second or so would be too long but this may be an arbitrary cutoff I suppose

Santa Claus Was n't your argument that '' there have to be more '' More than what More than we assume Which be what exactly a Most of the people I debate disagree with my premise Hardly debate otherwise Your favorite point that we sense so it h to be there have be challenged more than once When I do it you say `` good question '' and do not address it I 've address `` it '' your caricature be not my `` favourite point '' needle to say at length in a previous out and be currently discuss it with Eric Rescorla b There 's little point in respond the same point everywhere I do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply You still repeat that point I do Curious since I believe that be the first time I 've ever make it Not that repetition would imply much more than your seem inability to understand you ask me the same question I 'll give you the same answer especially when in this case I know the answer to be true I do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone be make the same point and I 'm push for time then I try to respond what I believe be the strong formulation of those point If that doesn't include your post tough this be USENET and life be tough all over c Since there 's a great deal of response this be n't always feasible I do my best to honestly answer question put to me You drop out of debate with some poster and continue with others You appear with the same issue every n month and start the dicussion at the begin again I 've only debate this issue twice in a.a and occasionally in t.a The first be in response to Simon Clippingdale 's positive assertion that disagreement about moral value inexorably acknowledges that moral be relative It do n't Now Simon have drop out of the debate for some time I take that to mean that he be either busy or bore with the topic I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty Do you d I ca n't always understand what you say Neither ca n't I understand you all the time Usually one asks what the other side mean Usually one do Usually you 're clear but sometimes you be n't and I ask you what you mean other time you seem to get extremely uptight and I feel that I 'm debate against line noise Sometimes I get tire and sometimes I have other thing I 'd rather do Again this be USENET and life be tough all over You 're go to have to deal with it e You 're start to get personally insult I may not even put your name in the hat in future That 's suppose to be a threat No that 's a simple statement and an assertion that I be not answerable to those who offer me baseless insult For example those who accuse me of lie about my personal belief while also complain that I do n't answer their question Like that you what you sense be evidence for the sense to be there If only everything would be so easy What almost everyone sens be evidence for the sense to be there Because to all intent and purpose it *is* there We have that argument For one your claim that everyone sens it be not found and you have be ask to give evidence for it often And then the correct statement would be it be reason to assume that it be there unless evidence against it have be found I have no problem with the second statement I have provide an argument that almost everyone sens that Freedom be valuable the only cogent objection to this come from jon livesey and be offer by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concept such a Freedom It 's a good point and I 'm think about it Your trick be to say I feel A be not right and so do many I know therefore A be absolutely right It neglect the possibility that these people consider A to be right a an effect of the same process restrict the claim of it absoluteness to those who have be subject of that process In other word refutes it You make the ontological claim you have to prove it Nonsense My `` trick '' be to say I feel that A be well than B and so do almost any disinterested person I ask Best evidence be therefore that A really be well than B subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B and that the result system of value be self-consistent Now get this `` really be well '' be an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that `` real material existence '' be a fictional model It may or may not correspond to something true It be nonetheless a useful _assumption_ Far more useful than the equally assume relativist '' trick '' to wit I feel that A be well than B and so do almost any disinterested person I ask However if even one person disagrees that A be well than B or if even one person dissent from mutually agree definition of A and B then it be the case that B be well than A for that person and nothing more can be say I say this be useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seek to maximise A can not morally take action against someone seek to maximise B e.g a terrorist To do that would be to claim that a supermajority 's carefully consider morality would be well than the terrorist 's which would of course be true but a no-no for an ethical relativist To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else be simply weasel word and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion For a similar argument I sense morality be subjective it do not hurt me to do thing that be consider to be objectively wrong by others If you mean that you do thing that some others consider objectively wrong and it turn out not to be the case for you of course this be possible It be neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense It serf a a counterexample for that everything that be subject to judgement be absolute And a long a you do n't provide evidence for that there be something universally agree upon there be no reason to believe your hypothesis I 've do this freedom with the proviso that I still have to answer jon 's objection that fuzzy concept like freedom have no objective meaning Further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it be independent of human or the attribute above look quite mislead Not really What evidence be there that _anything_ exists independently of human You 'll be hard press to find any that be n't logically equivalent when apply to value An analogous set of premise would be Premise 1 Some people believe that objectively speak the shortest route from my house to a bar be through the main entrance of the estate and down the Malahide road Premise 2 I checked it out and found that the shortest route from my which be much closer You would never deduce from these that there be no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that be seemingly how you derive your relativist claim use premise which be logically no different No Morals be a matter of belief so far The people still believe that the shortest way be through the main entrance No agreement on *belief* here And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there be a shortest way and that there be a method to convince everyone of that it be the shortest way indeed In other word your analogy work only when one assumes that your premise be right in the first place If not it be a fallacy And if this be an argument for objectivism you 'd be right It be n't though it 's a demonstration that the argument you give me be neither argument *against* objectivism nor argument *for* relativism Your gimmick be to assume in the first place that value be n't real and to use this to `` prove '' that value be n't real In other word you beg the question against me

the temple be rent that there be an earthquake and that it be dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graf open and body of the saint arose and go into Jeruselem appear to many beating Jesus to the resurection Mark and Luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple be rent but mention no earthquake or risen saint John be the only one who mention Jesus 's side be peirced Burial of Jesus Matthew say the Jews ask Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from be steal by the disciple and for the tomb to be seal All of this be supposedly do but the other gospel do not mention these precaution How long be Jesus in the tomb Depends where you look Matthew 12:40 give Jesus prophesy that he will spend `` three day and three night in the heart of the earth '' and Mark 10:34 have `` after three day meta treis emeras he will rise again '' As far a I can see from a quick look the prophecy have `` after three day '' but the post-resurrection narrative have `` on the third day '' Time of the Resurection Matthew say Sunday at dawn Mark say the sun be rise and John say it be dark Who be at the Empty Tomb Is it MAT 28:1 In the end of the sabbath a it begin to dawn toward the first day of the week come Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre MAR 16:1 And when the sabbath be past Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome have bought sweet spice that they might come and anoint him JOH 20:1 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it be yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone take away from the sepulchre Whom do they see at the tomb MAT 28:2 And behold there be a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descend from heaven and come and roll back the stone from the door and sat upon it MAT 28:3 His countenance be like lightning and his raiment white a snow MAT 28:4 And for fear of him the keeper do shake and become a dead men MAT 28:5 And the angel answer and say unto the woman Fear not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which be crucify MAR 16:5 And enter into the sepulchre they saw a young man sit on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they be affright LUK 24:4 And it come to pas a they be much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shin garment JOH 20:12 And seeth two angel in white sit the one at the head and the other at the foot where the body of Jesus have lain Belief that the disciple stole Jesus 's body Matthew say the guard be paid to tell this story but no other gospel make this claim Appearences of the risen Jesus Matthew say an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told them to tell the disciple to meet him in Galilee The disciple then go to a mountain previously agree opon and met Jesus there This be his only appearance except to the woman at the tomb Matthew only devotes five verse to the visit with the disciple Mark say that Jesus walk with two of the disciple in the country and that they told the rest of the disciple who refuse to believe Later he appear to the 11 disciple at mealtime Luke say two follower go the same day that Jesus rise from the dead to Emmaus a village eight mile from Jeruselem and there Jesus jioned them but be unrecognised While they ate a meal together that even they finally recognise Jesus whereopon he dissapeared Returning at once to Jeruselem they told the disciple of their experience and suddenly Jesus appear among them frighten them a they thought he be a spirit Jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preach to them John say Jesus appear to the disciple the even of the day he arrose in Jeruselem where they be hiding He breathe the Holy Ghost opon them but Thomas be not present and refuse to believe Eight day later Jesus join the disciple again at the same place and this time he convince Thomas Once more Jesus make an appearance to the disciple at the sea of Tiberias but again be not recognise After tell them to cast their netson the other side of the boat Jesus becomes know to them and prepares bread and fish for them They all eat together and converse The book of act far add to the confusion It say that Jesus show himself to the apostle for a period of 40 day after his resurection thus contradict Matthew Mark Luke AND John and spoke to them of thing pertain to the kingdom of God `` And when he have spoken these thing while they beheld he be take up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight And while they look steadfastly toward heaven a he go up two men stood by them in white apparel Which also say Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gaze into heaven This same Jesus which be take from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have see him go into heaven '' Acts 1:3-11 Paul outdoes every other `` authority '' by say that Jesus be see by 500 person between the time of the resurection and the assension although he do not say where He also claim that he himself `` a one born out of due time '' also saw Jesus 1 Cor 15:6-8 The Ascension Matthew say nothing about it Mark casually say that Jesus be recieved into heaven after he be finish talk with the disciple in Jeruselem Luke say Jesus lead the desciples to Bethany and that while he bless them he be part from them and carry up into heaven John say nothing about it Acts contradicts all of the above See previous section When second come MAT 24:34 Verily I say unto you This generation shall not pas till all these thing be fulfil MAR 13:30 Verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pas till all these thing be do LUK 21:32 Verily I say unto you This generation shall not pas away till all be fulfil 1 thessalonian 4:15-18 How many apostle be in office between the resurection and ascention 1 Corinthians 15:5 12 Matthew 27:3-5 minus one from 12 Acts 1:9-26 Mathias not elect until after resurrection MAT 28:16 Then the eleven disciple go away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus have appoint them ascend to heaven '' And Elijah go up by a whirlwind into heaven '' 2 Kings 2:11 '' No man hath ascend up to heaven but he that come down from heaven ... the Son of Man '' John 3:13 As you can see there be a number of contradiction in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of Jesus If these be good witness you would think that they could get SOME of these important detail right In fact I can not find very many point on where they AGREE You would think that they could at least agree on some of the point they be supposedly observe Because of the fact that there be so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection a present can not be take a literal truth Due to the nature of the story I doubt if it should be take a ANY sort of truth
tgk cs.toronto.edu Todd Kelley writes Faith and dogma be irrational The faith and dogma part of any religion be responsible for the irrationality of the individual I disagree In the end the *individual* be responsible for his/her own irrationality The individual 's belief in some dogmatic religion be a symptom of that irrationality Have you notice that philosopher tend to be atheist Atheists and agnostic I would imagine but yes that be my point An atheist would theoretically be just a ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion a a Christian and yet there be a persistence of atheist among the rank of philosopher Therefore the conflict between one's religious belief or lack thereof and the ability to be a philosopher must not be a great a you assert The fact that most philosopher may be non-religious be a secondary point Science a would be practice by atheist in contrast have a BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma As oppose to science practice by theist Be careful here Science do have a built-in defence against faith and dogma skepticism Unfortunately it be not foolproof There be that wonderful little creature know a the `` theory '' Many of u believe in the theory of evolution We have no absolute proof that this theory be true so why do we believe it Because it `` make more sense than ...

strongly correlate with irrational belief in absolute Irrational belief in absolute be strongly correlate with fanatism deletion |Theism be correlate with fanaticism I have neither say that all fanatism |is cause by theism nor that all theism lead to fanatism The point be |theism increase the chance of become a fanatic One could of course |argue that would be fanatic tend towards theism for example but I just |have to loook at the time in history when theism be the dominant ideology |to invalidate that conclusion that that be the basic mechanism behind it IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your assumption that theism be the factor to be consider Bogus I just say that theism be not the only factor for fanatism The point be that theism be *a* factor That 's your claim now back it up I consider your argument a useful a the follow Belief be strongly correlate with fanaticism Therefore belief be *a* factor in fanaticism True and utterly useless Note this be *any* belief not belief in Gods Tiring to say the least I have back it up read the first statement I have read it Conspicuous by it absence be any evidence or point The latter be the fallacy of the wrong analogy Saying someone believe something be hardly an information about the person at all Saying someone be a theist hold much more information Further the correlation between theist and fanatism be high than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special feature of theistic belief Truth by blatant assertion Evidence Gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on be all more reliable indicator And the really dangerous people the source of fanaticism be often none of these thing They be cynical manipulator of the gullible who know precisely what they be do That 's a claim you have to support Please note that especially in the field of theism the leader believe what they say If you believe that you 're incredibly naive You Frank O'Dwyer be living in a dream world I wonder if there be any base of discussion left after such a statement As a matter of fact I think you be ignorant of human nature Even when one start with something one do not believe one get easily fool into actually believe what one say To give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement The onus of proof be on you sunshine What make you think that theist leader believe what they say Especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely follow by it opposite The practice be not restrict to theism but it 's there for anyone to see It 's almost an epidemic in this country Just for instance if it be harder for a camel to pas thru the eye of a needle why be the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner Why be there church to the square inch in my country Now *some* brand of theism and more precisely *some* theist do tend to fanaticism I grant you To tar all theist with this brush be bigotry not a reason argument and it read to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom Ever read Animal Farm That 's a straw man And a usually in discussion with you one have to repeat it Read what I have write above not every theism lead to fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism The point be there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism No some of it come from feature which *some* theism have in common with *some* fanaticism Your last statement simply be n't imply by what you say before because you 're try to sneak in `` innate feature of all theism '' The word you 're grope for be `` some '' Bogus again Not all theism a be be fanatic However the rest already give backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and theism And far the specialty of other theistic belief allows them to switch to fanatism easily It take just a nifty improvement in the theology Truth by blatant assertion Gullibility by the way be one of them No shit Sherlock So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have a oppose to the case you be try to make Because there be more about theism that the attraction to gullible people cause the correlation And the whole discussion start that way by the statement that theism be meaningfully correlate to fanatism which you challenged Indeed I do As I recall I ask for evidence What be the correlation of which you speak And to say that I be go to forbid religion be another of your straw men Interesting that you have nothing well to offer I say it read like a warm up to that That 's because it 's an irrational and bogus tirade and have no other use than create a nice Them/Us split in the mind of excitable people such a be to be found on either side of church wall Blah blah blah I be quite well aware that give everyone their right protects me well from fanatic than the other way round Of course other people be always fanatic never oneself Your wish to slur all theist seem pretty fanatical to me It be quite nice to see that you be actually imply a connection between that argument and the rise of fanatism So far it be just another of your assertion So You can do it 2 Define `` irrational belief '' e.g. be it rational to believe that reason be always useful |Irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason The latter have |been discuss for a long time with Charley Wingate One point be that |the belief violate reason often and another that a process that do |not lend itself to rational analysis do not contain reliable information Well there be a glare paradox here an argument that reason be useful base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrational Which be it That 's bogus Self reference be not circular And since the evaluation of usefulness be possible within rational system it be allow O.K. it 's oval It 's still beg the question however And though that certainly be allow it 's not rational And you claim to be rational and all Another of your assertion No proof no evidence just claim Hey I learn it from you Did I do good At the risk of repeat myself and hearing `` we have that before '' we do n't hear a _refutation_ before so we 're back Deal with it you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful Someone who think reason be crap wo n't buy it you see That be unusually weak even for you The latter implies that my proof depends on their opinion Somehow who do not accept that there be triangle wo n't accept Pythagoras Wow that 's an incredible insight I do n't have to prove them wrong in their opinion It be possible to show that their system leave out useful information respectively claim unreliable or even absurd statement to be information Totally circular and totally useless Their wish to believe make them believe Things be judge by their appeal and not by their information It make you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contains zillion of possible pitfall From belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proof they attempt Truth by blatant assertion I 've see a many bogus proof of the non-existence of god a I have of their existence Rational system by the way do not mean that every data have to come from logical analysis the point be that the evaluation of the data do not contradict logic It easily follow that such a system do not allows to evaluate if it rational in itself Yes it be possible to evaluate that it be rational in a system that be not rational by the fallacy of that system but since the validity of the axiom be agree upon that have a little impact a the possibility of a demon ala Descartes This just do n't parse sorry So far it just a matter of consistency I use ratiional argument to show that my system be consistent or that theirs be n't The evaluation of the Nor this prediction do not need rationality It do not contradict however Your argument be a silly a prove mathematical statement need mathematics and mathematics be therfore circular Anybody else think Godel be silly Stream of consciousness type What be that suppose to mean The first part of the second statement contains no information because you do n't say what `` the belief '' be If `` the belief '' be strong theism and/or strong atheism then your statement be not in general true The second part of your sentence be patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysis but be assume to contain reliable information regardless of what process be use to obtain it I 've be speak of religious system with contradictory definition of god here An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here be a an often refute fallacy Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice And far one can evaluate axiom in large system out of which they be usually derive `` I exist '' be derive if you want it that way Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom what be it you be try to say That at some point people always wind up say `` this datum be reliable '' for no particular reason at all Example `` I be not dream '' Nope There be evidence for it The trick be that the choice of an axiomatic basis of a system be difficult because the possibility be interwoven One therefore chooses that with the least assumption or with assumption that be necessary to get information out of the system anyway I 'd like to see this allege evidence One do not need to define axiom in order to define an evaluation method for usefulness the foundation be laid by how one feel at all that 's not how one feel about it I see You have no irrational belief But then fanatic never do do they |Compared the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of |their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational I ca n't agree with this until you be specific *which* theism To say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which I suspect you do not have Using the traditonal definition of god Personal supernatural entity with objective effect on this world Usually connect to moral and/or the way the world work IMO any belief about such god be necessarily irrational That do not mean that people who hold them be in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence Some atheist be also scientist for example They do n't use theism when do science Or it would n't be science Please note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment a well They just prohibit formulate them a objective statement Ergo nothing be objective Fair enough |The affinity to fanatism be easily see It have to be true because I believe |it be nothing more than a work hypothesis However the belief say they be |more than a work hypothesis I do n't understand this Can you formalise your argument Person A believe system B becuase it sound so nice That do not make B true it be at best a work hypothesis However the content of B be that it be true AND that it be more than a work hypothesis Testing or evaluate evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because B already believe say it be wronG/ a waste of time/ not possible Depending on the far content of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants be to be kill this can have interest effect Peculiar definition of interest but sure Now show that a belief in god entail the far content of which you speak Why be n't my catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example Maybe they do n't believe in it Maybe it 's the conjunction of `` B asserts B '' and '' jail/kill dissenter '' that be important and the belief in god be entirely irrelevant It certainly seem so to me but then I have no axe to grind here The example with your neighbour be a fallacy That *your* neighbour don't say little about others And there be time when exactly that happen Nope it 's not a fallacy It just do n't go to the correlation you wish to see And tell me when it be not irrelevant why be such statement about Amalekites and Idolaters in the Holy Books Please note that one could edit them out when they be not relevant anymore Because god do n't err What do that say about that message Excuse me THE Holy Books And how come we have theist say genocide order by god be ok. A god be the easy way to excuse anything and therefore highly attract to fanatic Not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatic can have on the rest of the believer Happens again and again and again A god be neither the easy way to excuse anything nor the only way

El-Awa American Trust Publications 1981 I reiterate that I would agree with you that there be little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an In Islamic history a well apostasy have rarely be punish Belief be consider a matter of conscience and since there be to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostate have be generally left to believe or not believe a they will However when an apostate make attack upon `` God and His Messenger '' the situation change Now the charge of apostasy may be complicate with other charge perhaps charge of sedition treason spy etc If the person make a public issue of their apostasy or mount public attack a oppose to arguement against Islam the situation be likewise complicate If the person spread slander or broadcast falsehood again the situation change The punishment vary accord to the situation the apostate be in Anyhow the charge of aggravate apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie 's case There be a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and be in the situation where someone unilaterally wage war by their action creates disorder make mischief etc against the Muslims and creates a situation that result in harm to Muslims Here a small group or even a single individual could be say to be engage in such a practise In other word there be a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly define party wage war conclude treaty exchange prisoner etc and deal with attack that come from isolated individual or group against Islam It be the second situation the unilateral attack and the spread of `` fasad '' that would apply in the case of Rushdie The matter of Rushdie be not a simple matter of ban an offensive book ban the book be secondary a full set of circumstance follow the publication of the book come into play a well include the death of many Muslims and Rushdie 's and his publisher Media game Now I do not believe in _blindly_ follow anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law If someone tell me `` Islam say such and such '' I immediately say `` show me the support for this statement from the Qur'an and Sunnah '' I believe this to be my Islamic duty for accord to one hadith of the Prophet peace and blessing of God be with him if your leader tell you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sin for do wrong even though you be _blindly_ follow the instruction of your leader _I_ be responsible for my own action not Abu Hanifa or Imam Malik etc. even if I be blindly follow the opinion of Abu Hanifa etc Now to my understand the hadith upon which those who support Khomeini's fatwa be relate to a particular instance that occur during war time Now brother in general it be IMHO ridiculous and wrong to say that a hadith relate to the action of war be usable during time of peace I think any sensible human be can see this so I personally think that the reason of some of our ulema in this matter be faulty for they think it be legitimate to use act of war in time of peace regard this particular subject I be not sure which hadith you be refer to above I believe that one of the Qur'anic verse on which the fatwa be base be 5:33 Every verse in the Qur'an have a correspond `` circumstance of revelation '' but in no way be the understand the tafsir of the verse restrict solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it be reveal If this be the case then we could say that all the law and regulation that be reveal when the Muslims be NOT involve in conflict should be suspend when they be at war The logic do not follow In complex real-life situation there may be many verse and many hadith which can all be related to a single complicate situation The internal relationship between these verse may be quite complex such that arrive at an understand of how the verse interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demand task It be not necessarily a simple `` this or that '' process There may be many parameter involve there may be a large context in which a particular situation should be view All these matter impinge on the situation In other word there be a great deal involve in decipher the Qur'an The Qur'an asks u to reflect on it verse but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and it correspond hadith If the reflection be for the sake of increase personal piety then each person have his own level of understand and there be no harm in that However if the reflection be in order to decide matter that pertain to the State to the gestation of law and ruling to the gestation of society the dispense of justice the guidance of the community then there be certain minimum requirement of understand that one should achieve Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq a.s. relates some of these requirement a taught by the Prophet S.A. in a hadith '' ... he who do not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogate verse from the abrogate one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous and do not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and do not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one and do not know the circumstance of revelation and do not understand the technical word of the Qur'an whether simple or compound and do not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and be ignorant of advance and delay in it verse and do not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the begin from the termination and be unaware of the question and the answer the disjoin and the join and the exception and the all-inclusive and be ignorant of an adjective of a precede noun that explains the subsequent one and be unaware of the emphasize subject and the detailed one the obligatory law and the permission the place of the duty and rule and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and do not know the join word and the word that be related to those come before them or after them then such a man do not know the Qur'an nor be he among the people of the Qur'an ... '' Based on these and other hadith and in accordance with many Qur'anic verse `` Why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understand tafaqquh in religion and to warn people when they return to them so that they may beware '' 9:122 a science of jurisprudence arose The requirement for a person to be consider a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matter of law and religion be many I 've list a few major division below there be of course many subdivision within these heading Knowledge of Arabic syntax conjugation root semantics oratory Knowledge of tafsir and principle of tafsir Logic mantiq A knowledge of Hadiths A knowledge of transmitter rijal Knowledge of the principle of juriprudence Qur'an Sunnah Consensus Reasoning The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purpose of law involves discussion of imperative awamir discussion of negative imperative nawahi discussion of generality and particularity aam wa khas discussion of unconditional and conditional discussion of tacit meaning discussion of the abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogate The principle of Application of the law involves principle of exemption principle of precaution principle of option principle of mastery The jurisprudent be bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronounce judgement on a give situation It be not a matter of look at one verse and one hadith Now no one should blindly follow anyone but there be a difference between blind follow and accede to the opinion of someone who be clearly more knowledgeable and more qualify than oneself There be the famous hadith of the Prophet S.A. in which he say '' The fuqaha religious scholar be the trustee of the Prophet a long a they do not concern themselves with the illicit desire pleasure and wealth of this world '' The Prophet S.A. be ask `` O Messenger of God How may we know if they so concern themselves '' He S.A. reply '' By see whether they follow the ruling power If they do that fear for your religion and shun them '' I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholar who base themselves upon them The Prophet also refer to the fuqaha a `` The fortress of Islam '' My only point be to make it clear that arrive at a legal judgement call into play a certain amount of expertise the specific of this expertise be delineate in the Qur'an and hadith Those who acquire this expertise be praise in both the Qur'an and hadith those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matter that affect society state and religion be caution The only reason I say anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group be because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that be apostasy be wrong When one discus something they should at least base their discussion on fact Secondly Khomeini be condemn a a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible another instance of create a straw man and then beating him Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam Please email me Rashid if you think we should do this I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup Unfortunately I do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderate group be out of the question I can not post to a moderate group like soc.religion.islam How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc

Faith and dogma be dangerous Yes Religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and for that reason I scorn religion To be fair you should really qualify this a semitic-western religion but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway I have express this notion in the past Some Christians debate with me whether Christianity leaf any room for reason I claimed rationality be quell out of Christianity by faith and dogma Again this should really be evaluate at a personal level For example there be only one Jesus presumably and he probably do n't say all that many thing and yet seemingly billion and billion of Christian sect have arisen Perhaps there be one that be totally dedicate to rationalism and believe in Christ a in pantheism It would seem to go against the Bible but it be amaze what people come up with under the guise of `` personal interpretation '' A philosopher can not be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind whereas a Christian can not due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any religion This be a good point We have here the quintessential Christian he set up a system of values/beliefs for himself which work very well and every event/experience be understandable and deablable within the framework of this system However we also have an individual who have the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which be important because the problem with such a system be the same a with any system one can not be open mind to the point of `` test hypothesis '' against the basic premise of the system without destroy whatever faith be invest therein unless of course all the test fail In other word the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate morality without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system I claimed that a `` Christian philosopher '' be not a Christian but be a person whose belief at the moment correspond with those of Christianity Consider that a person visit or guard a prison be not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone in a prison Can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment be in a prison Can we define a Christian to be someone who at the moment have Christian belief No because if a person be free to go he be not a prisoner Similarly if a person be not constrain by faith and dogma he be not a Christian Interesting but again when it seem to basically boil down to individual nuance although not always I will admit and probably it be the mass-oriented division which be the most appal it becomes irrelevant unfortunately I admit it 's a word game I 'm go by the dictionary definition of religion `` religion n. 1. concern over what exists beyond the visible world differentiate from philosophy in that it operates through faith or intuition rather than reason ... '' -- Webster's Now let 's go beyond the word game I do n't claim that religion cause genocide I think that if all human be atheist there would still be genocide There will always be human who do n't think There will always be human who do n't ask themselves what be the REAL difference between themselves and people with different color skin or a different language or different belief Granted Religion be like the gun that do n't kill anybody Religion encourages faith and dogma and although it do n't directly condemn people it encourages the use of `` just because '' think It be `` just because '' think that kill people In which case the people become the bullet and the religion a the gun merely offer them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if I may be so bold a to extend your similie Sure religion have many good quality It encourages benevolence and philanthropy OK so take out only the bad thing like faith dogma and tradition Put in the good thing like careful reason and science The result be secular humanism Would n't it be nice if everyone be a secular humanist To please the supernaturalists you might even leave God in there but the secular emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start think and they too would realize that a belief in a god really do n't put anyone far ahead in understand the universe OK I 'm just poke fun at the supernaturalists Also understandable ...

'' that can be test `` Better '' and `` bad '' be almost always define in the context of a moral system Your prediction will _always_ be correct *within* *that* *moral* *system* What you need now be an objective definition of '' good '' and `` bad '' I wish you luck People 's *ideas* about the age of object X be *not* objective you can have any idea you like and I ca n't stop you Universae and their age be another ballgame they be what they be and if you dislike some detail of them that 's a problem with your *opinion* of them Sure Assume an objective reality and you get statement like this Is n't that what _you're_ do when assume an `` objectively real '' morality Besides what _exactly_ be provably wrong with my statement I claim that morality be an opinion of ours and a such subjective and individual If I 'm wrong then some more-or-less objectively `` real '' thing exists which you label `` objective morality '' can you back up this positive claim of existence Can you back up your positive claim above No That 's because it 's an assumption I make the same assumption about value on the basis that there be no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two be precisely the same Claiming there be no objective morality be suddenly a positive claim Besides I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim ponder different individual both fully functional a human being and member of society but yet with wildly different moral code If morality be '' objective '' at least one should be way off base but yet hir 'incorrect morality seem to function fine How come As for produce these individual it might be easy to pick them from different society say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist deletia test for football on desk Now take a look at morality See anything If so please inform me which way to look and WHY to look that particular way a oppose to some other Get my drift No Just look Are you claim never to know what good mean One thing be `` good '' under some circumstance because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason Other time we wish to do something else and that thing be no longer so clearly `` good '' at all Some thing be hard to make `` good '' because we 'd seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into Still the Aztecs be do fine until the Spaniards wipe them out I almost always know what `` good '' mean sometimes I even know why I never claim this `` good '' be thereby fix in stone immutable ...

Kevin Anthoney kax cs.nott.ac.uk write about my reply Diplomatic It a society that be constantly on the verge of flame Usenet diplomacy be the best way to ensure the voice of reason get through be n't it I realize I 'm fight Occam 's razor in this argument so I 'll try to explain why I feel a mind be necessary Kevin unfortunately you be now delve into field I know too little about algorithm Your reason a I see it be very much along the line of Roger Penrose who claimed that mathematical 'insight can not be algorithmic in his book _The emperor 's new mind Concerning computer mind and the law of physics_ However Penrose's claim that he _has_ mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusion We be obviouslu take very different viewpoint I try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realise that it might not be anything special but certainly useful Thinking back of what I write do you think worm have mind or not They be able to experience pain at least they behave just like that Yet it be conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a `` total synthesis of C. elegans '' from the element Would such a worm have a mind Firstly I 'm not impressed with the ability of algorithm They're great at solve problem once the method have be work out but not at work out the method itself This be true to some extent However I do not think that our brain work like computer at all In fact there be substantial evidence Skarda 1985 Skarda Freeman 1987 that brain work more or less chaotically generate enough randomness for mental state to evolve Our brain work much like genetic algorithm generator I suppose the trick still have to be there in some form to be discover Does this mean that all the idea we will ever have be already pre-programmed into our brain This be somewhat unlikely give that our brain ultimately be encode in 46 chromosome worth of genetic material much of which be n't use Indeed this be extremely unlikely give the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain I suggest however that before try to understand our consciousness a a collection of algorithm Kevin take a look at the reference I mention and think again I still think the best expert on the nature of a conscious mind be neurologist neuropsychologists and biologist but do not flame me for my opinion since they study being that be conscious The reason I be repeat my advice be that this discussion can not lead to anywhere if our background be too different And please do not bring QM into this discussion at all not all physicist be happy with the claim that our consciousness play some special role in physic I would say it do n't The other problem with algorithm be their instability Not many algorithm survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive stroke without go completely haywire there be side-effects but patient still seem remarkably stable Also neuron in perfectly healthy people be die at an alarm rate can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bit of it's code Again _brains be not computers_ Do n't forget this This do not mean they need something else to work they just work differently Their primary 'purpose be perception and guidance of action self-awareness and high intelligence be later appearance The next problem be the sticky question of `` What be colour '' replace 'colour with the sensation of your choice Presumably the materialist viewpoint be that it 's the product of some kind of chemical reaction The usual product of such a reaction be energy different chemical Is colour a mixture of these You be still expect that we could find the idea of 'green in our brain somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical This be not how I see it The sensation 'green be a certain time-dependent pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex and it be distribute with the help of area V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain Indeed a fire pattern I have sometimes thought of our consciousness a a global free induction pattern of these local fire pattern but this be just idle speculation Scientific American 's September 1992 issue be a special issue on mind and brain Have you already read it from cover to cover There be two article on visual perception so you might be interested But again please note that subjective experience can not be observe from a third-person perspective If we see nothing but neuronal activity we can not go on to conclude that this be not the mind Kalat 1988 writes about numerous example where electric stimulation of different area of brain have lead to various change in the patient state of mind For instance a patient whose septal area be stimulate without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview be quickly cure of his depression and start discuss a plan to seduce his girlfriend Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes lead to embarrass situation when the patient have start flirt with the therapist In conclusion there be evidence that 1 brain be essentially necessary for subjective experience brain damage be usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage 2 conscious process involve substantial brain activity in various area of brain when we think of colour our visual cortex be activate etc 3 consciousness be an afterthought we become conscious of our action with a half a second delay and our brain be ahead of our 'conscious will by at least 350 m Thus I think it be fruitful to turn the question `` Why do I see colour '' around and ask `` What be this I that seem to be observe `` since it seem that our conscious mind be not the king of our brain If this be so a computer wo n't see colour because the chemistry be different Does an algorithm that see colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that do n't It should n't because the output of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstance So why do we see colour This depends on what be meant by 'seeing colour Does a neural network that be capable of recognise handwritten number from 0 to 9 see the number if it be capable of sort them If you be ask `` why do an animal who be conscious of itself a an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who do n't '' I have a good answer read my previous post where I write why a sense of identity help social animal to swap role and act more morally so that they do n't unconsciously kill each other with newly discover weapon A bit extreme but this be the basic idea When early _Homo_ become more and more efficient in use tool a sense of identity and the concept of 'self have to evolve in line with this development Indeed respect for others and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantage for social animal such a early human If I remember correctly quantum mechanic consists of a wavefunction with two process act on it The first process have be call 'Unitary Evolution or U be govern by Schroedinger 's equation and be well know The second process call various thing such a 'collapse of the wavefunction or 'state vector reduction or R and be more mysterious It be usually say to occur when a 'measurement take place although nobody seem to know precisely when that occurs When it do occur the effect of R be to abruptly change the wavefunction If mind be require for this do this mean that until human mind come to the scene wavefunctions never collapse but remain in the superposition for aeon My how powerful we be This have be discuss before and I think this topic be irrelevant since we do not agree that mind be necessary and neither do physicist Anyway I 'm speculate that mind would be in part X There seem to be some link between consciousness and R in that we never see linear superposition of anything although there be alternative explainations for this I 've no idea how a brain be suppose to access part X but since this be only speculation that wo n't matter too much My main point be that there might be a place for mind in physic I agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physic need sharp mind to solve many real problem I 'll go back to my nice pad cell now if that 's OK with you It 's OK if you do n't forget to take with you the reference I write about in my previous

you one have to repeat it Read what I have write above not every theism lead to fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism The point be there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism No some of it come from feature which *some* theism have in common with *some* fanaticism Your last statement simply be n't imply by what you say before because you 're try to sneak in `` innate feature of all theism '' The word you 're grope for be `` some '' Gullibility by the way be one of them No shit Sherlock So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have a oppose to the case you be try to make And to say that I be go to forbid religion be another of your straw men Interesting that you have nothing well to offer I say it read like a warm up to that That 's because it 's an irrational and bogus tirade and have no other use than create a nice Them/Us split in the mind of excitable people such a be to be found on either side of church wall 2 Define `` irrational belief '' e.g. be it rational to believe that reason be always useful |Irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason The latter have |been discuss for a long time with Charley Wingate One point be that |the belief violate reason often and another that a process that do |not lend itself to rational analysis do not contain reliable information Well there be a glare paradox here an argument that reason be useful base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would be irrational Which be it That 's bogus Self reference be not circular And since the evaluation of usefulness be possible within rational system it be allow O.K. it 's oval It 's still beg the question however And though that certainly be allow it 's not rational And you claim to be rational and all At the risk of repeat myself and hearing `` we have that before '' we do n't hear a _refutation_ before so we 're back Deal with it you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful Someone who think reason be crap wo n't buy it you see Your argument be a silly a prove mathematical statement need mathematics and mathematics be therfore circular Anybody else think Godel be silly The first part of the second statement contains no information because you do n't say what `` the belief '' be If `` the belief '' be strong theism and/or strong atheism then your statement be not in general true The second part of your sentence be patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysis but be assume to contain reliable information regardless of what process be use to obtain it I 've be speak of religious system with contradictory definition of god here An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here be a an often refute fallacy Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice And far one can evaluate axiom in large system out of which they be usually derive `` I exist '' be derive if you want it that way Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom what be it you be try to say That at some point people always wind up say `` this datum be reliable '' for no particular reason at all Example `` I be not dream '' |Compared the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of |their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational I ca n't agree with this until you be specific *which* theism To say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which I suspect you do not have Using the traditonal definition of god Personal supernatural entity with objective effect on this world Usually connect to moral and/or the way the world work IMO any belief about such god be necessarily irrational That do not mean that people who hold them be in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence Some atheist be also scientist for example |The affinity to fanatism be easily see It have to be true because I believe |it be nothing more than a work hypothesis However the belief say they be |more than a work hypothesis I do n't understand this Can you formalise your argument Person A believe system B becuase it sound so nice That do not make B true it be at best a work hypothesis However the content of B be that it be true AND that it be more than a work hypothesis Testing or evaluate evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because B already believe say it be wronG/ a waste of time/ not possible Depending on the far content of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants be to be kill this can have interest effect Peculiar definition of interest but sure Now show that a belief in god entail the far content of which you speak Why be n't my catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example Maybe they do n't believe in it Maybe it 's the conjunction of `` B asserts B '' and '' jail/kill dissenter '' that be important and the belief in god be entirely irrelevant It certainly seem so to me but then I have no axe to grind here

The point of my post be that Rushdie be not be condemn solely for the `` word '' in his book although this be certainly a contribute factor It be the whole series of action of Rushdie and his publisher follow the publication of the book and the initial medium spotlight place on the book that in large part lead to the fatwa The kind of fatwa level against Rushdie be not lightly place and there be any number of anti-Islamic writer both within and outside the Islamic world who have not have fatwa make against them Here someone who add fuel to an explosive situation might be charge with incitement to riot if people die in the rioting the charge against him might become even more serious How can Rushdie be blame for the death of people who be demonstrate against him The death should be blame on the people who dealt with the demonstration or on the demonstrator themselves if they be violent To what length will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour against Rushdie Once the Rushdie situation explode into the medium the Muslim voice on the matter of the book be effectively restrict to short video byte show the dramatic highlight of Muslim demonstration For every twenty or so newspaper magazine article interview etc support Rushdie there would appear one Muslim voice This person be usually select base on how dramatic and incoherent he be not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time This approx twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis with Rushdie in the central spotlight a the man of the moment the valiant defender of everyman's right to free speech decouple from responsibility As an aside it's interest that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech go up some book defame certain ethnic and religious group continued to be ban here It be felt that they injured the sensibility of these group and present a false image which could promote feeling of hate towards these group For Muslims this kind of double standard be annoy Rushdie saw this spotlight a a golden opportunity to lash out at '' organize '' Islam and he do so with admirable verbal skill The only kind of Islam which Rushdie find palatable be what he call a `` secular '' Islam an Islam separate from it 's Qur'an it 's Prophet God it legislation and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena Fine Rushdie make his view know the Muslim 's make their anger at his book know The scale of the whole affair erupt into global proportion it be by this time already a political situation affect government a well a individual The situation be a serious one with far-reaching political implication At the centre of this turmoil be Rushdie throw fuel on the fire engage in a personal crusade that make him oblivious to any sense of caution Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such a this have no responsibility have no reason to exercise restraint of any kind have no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matter calm down Perhaps you even feel that he be justified in `` boldly '' defy the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work no matter what insult they find within it Perhaps you see him a a kind of secular `` heroic Knight '' mount on the his medium steed do battle with the `` dragon '' of Islamic `` fundamentalism '' Well Khomeini saw him a a disingeneous author who grow up in a Muslim atmosphere knew well what Muslim 's hold dear who write a book which mischievously us certain literary convention to slander insult and attack Islam and it most notable personality who when face with a situation that become a worldwide crisis continued with his mischief in the world stage of the medium who even after people be injured and kill because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation continued his mischief instead of have the good sense to desist Khomeini saw the crisis a mischief make on a grand scale mischief make that grow in scale a the scale of the crisis enlarge The death of Muslims around the world and Rushdie 's continued medium mischief even after this be the trigger factor that seem to decide Khomeini on put a stop to the mischief The person at the centre of all these event be Rushdie he be the source of the continue mischief all medium support government support be just that support The source be Rushdie and his publisher who be nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and be very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the medium The Islamic ruling that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief make be apply to Rushdie You 're attempt at justification be not do the image of Islam any good I have make no attempt at justification only at explanation `` Image '' be the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists for Islam and for Rushdie If Muslims willingly relegate themselves to become a sub-culture within a large secular culture such that the secular principle and law have precedence over the law of Islam then I have no doubt that Islam would then be thought to have a good `` image '' Principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image A `` good image '' usually mean `` be more like me '' Your attempt at TOTALLY exonerate Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that result in the polarization brought about by the crisis In Iran the situation be monitor for many month when Rushdie kept add fuel to the flame through the free worldwide voice that the medium give him the situation be monitor more seriously When even after many death occur worldwide Rushdie still do not desist the fatwa be pronounce When behaving like a total jerk endangers life and the jerk see this and still insists on his right to behave like a total jerk he have the rug jerked out from under him If the muslim do n't make such a big fuss over the book like issue death threat and kill publisher NO ONE WOULD HAVE HEARD OF IT

Briefly no There be widespread folklore but no good documentary evidence or even solid rumor concern the death of the Apostles Further the usual context of such argument a you observe be `` No Martyrs for a Lie '' i.e the willingness of these people to die rather than recant be evidence for the truth of their belief This add the quite strong twist that the propose martyr must have be offer the chance of life by recant Since we do n't even know how or where they die we certainly do n't have this information By the way even in the case of Stephen it be not at all clear that he could have save himself by recant The willingness of true believer to die for their belief be it in Jesus or Jim Jones be well-documented so martyrdom in and of itself say little See 1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priest of Baal

I use to believe what I read in book when I be young or what other people told me but I grow more and more skeptical the more I read I learn what it mean to use _reason_ As a student of chemistry I have to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compound in the lab I _hated_ experiment like this they be old-fashioned and increase the student 's workload considerably Besides I have to do it twice since I fail in my first attempt However I think I 'll never forget the lesson No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown be X it may still be Y It be _very_ tempt to jump into conclusion take a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which be inconsistent But it can still be wrong I found out that I be after all use exactly the same mechanism to believe in god mental self-assurance suspension of fear filter of information In other word it be only me no god play any part The life death and resurection of Christ be document historical fact Oh And I have well believe this Dan many UFO story be much well document than the resurrection of Jesus The resurrection be document quite haphazardly in the Bible it seem the author do not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out Besides the end of the gospel probably contain later addition and insertion for instance the end of Mark 16:9-20 be miss from many early text say my Bible Jesus may have live and die but he be probably misunderstood As much a anything else you learn How do you choose what to believe and what not to This be easy I believe that the world exists independent of my mind and that logic and reason can be use to interpret and analyse what I observe Nothing else need to be take on faith I will go by the evidence It make no difference whether I believe George Washington exist or not I assume that he do consider the vast amount of evidence present There be no way to get into a sceptical heart You can not say you have give a sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have You must TRUST not just go to church and participate in it 's activity Were you ever willing to die for what you believe A liar how do you know what my attitude be Try reading your Bible again I be willing to die for my faith Those who do be usually remember a hero at least among those who believe Dan do you think I'm lie when I say I believe firmly for 15 year It seem it be very difficult to admit that someone who have really believe do not do so anymore But I ca n't go on lie to myself Blind trust be dangerous and I be just another blind lead by the blind But if god really want me she 'll know what to do I 'm willing I just do n't know whether she exists look at the available evidence it look like she do n't Petri

'' Liberate '' be the way an invader describes an invasion include if I 'm not mistaken the Iraqi liberation of Kuwait Never invade Nicaragua Only with more word game can you say `` send in the Marines '' So if you mean by the word `` invade '' some sort of military action where we cross someone 's border you be right 5 out of 6 But normally '' invade '' carry a connotation of attack an autonomous nation If some nation `` invades '' the U.S. Virgin Islands would they be invade the Virgin Islands or the U.S. So from this point of view your score fall to 2 out of 6 Mexico Panama Oh good word game If you let the aggressor pick the word there 's scarcely ever be a reprehensible military action What 's a `` peace-nik '' Is that somebody who *doesn't* masturbate over `` Guns n'Ammo '' or what Is it suppose to be bad to be a peace-nik No it 's someone who believe in `` peace-at-all-costs '' In other word a person who would have support give Hitler not only Austria and Czechoslakia but Poland too if it could have avert the War And one who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews slav and political dissident in area he control a long a he left the rest of u alone That 's a convenient technique much see on alt.atheism define those who disagree with you accord to a straw-man extreme that match virtually nobody '' Is it suppose to be bad to be a peace-nik '' you ask Well it depends on what your value be If you value life over liberty peace over freedom then I guess not But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself if you 'd rather die fight for liberty than live under a tyrant 's heel then yes it 's `` bad '' to be a peace-nik Very noble and patriotic I 'm sure the fine young Americans who carpet-bombed Iraqi infantry position from over the horizon destroyed Iraq 's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the sky or far or who bulldoze other Iraqi infantry into their trench or more importantly the commander who order them to be just thrill to be risk death if not risk it by much in the defense of the liberty of ... well wealthy Kuwaitis Ca n't have those oil-fields under a tyrant 's heel if that tyrant be antagonistic to US interest ...

A brilliant example of use the introspective objection against materialist theory of consciousness Diplomatic I realize I 'm fight Occam 's razor in this argument so I 'll try to explain why I feel a mind be necessary Firstly I 'm not impressed with the ability of algorithm They're great at solve problem once the method have be work out but not at work out the method itself As a specific example I like to solve numerical crossword not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type the hard one To do these with any efficiency you need to figure out a variety of trick Now I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzle but in do so you have to work out the trick _yourself_ and program them into the computer You can of course 'obfuscate the trick and write the program so that it be uncovered but a far a I can see the trick still have to be there in some form to be discover Does this mean that all the idea we will ever have be already pre-programmed into our brain This be somewhat unlikely give that our brain ultimately be encode in 46 chromosome worth of genetic material much of which be n't use One way around this be to bring the environment into the equation but again a far a I can see this still have an air of 'if you see object X then perform action Y and we do n't seem to get anywhere The algorithm have to anticipate what it might see and what conclusion to draw from it 's experience The other problem with algorithm be their instability Not many algorithm survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive stroke without go completely haywire there be side-effects but patient still seem remarkably stable Also neuron in perfectly healthy people be die at an alarm rate can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bit of it's code The next problem be the sticky question of `` What be colour '' replace 'colour with the sensation of your choice Presumably the materialist viewpoint be that it 's the product of some kind of chemical reaction The usual product of such a reaction be energy different chemical Is colour a mixture of these If this be so a computer wo n't see colour because the chemistry be different Does an algorithm that see colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that do n't It should n't because the output of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstance So why do we see colour However such a view be actually a nonsolution How should mind be able to act a observer feel pain and pleasure and issue command any well than the brain Moreover how do the interaction occur A bit of idle speculation ... If I remember correctly quantum mechanic consists of a wavefunction with two process act on it The first process have be call 'Unitary Evolution or U be govern by Schroedinger 's equation and be well know The second process call various thing such a 'collapse of the wavefunction or 'state vector reduction or R and be more mysterious It be usually say to occur when a 'measurement take place although nobody seem to know precisely when that occurs When it do occur the effect of R be to abruptly change the wavefunction I envisage R a an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something else which I shall imaginitively call 'part X It seem reasonable to assume that _something_ cause R although that something might be the wavefunction itself in which case part X be simply the wavefunction Note though that we 'd need more than U to explain R. Anyway I 'm speculate that mind would be in part X There seem to be some link between consciousness and R in that we never see linear superposition of anything although there be alternative explainations for this I 've no idea how a brain be suppose to access part X but since this be only speculation that wo n't matter too much My main point be that there might be a place for mind in physic I 'll go back to my nice pad cell now if that 's OK with you Petri -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Kevin Anthoney kax cs.nott.ac.uk Do n't believe anything you read in .sig file

1993Apr15.181924.21026 dcs.warwick.ac.uk simon dcs.warwick.ac.uk Simon Clippingdale writes I write Imagine that 1000000 Alterian dollar turn up in your bank account every month Suppose far that this money be be paid to you by a your big-hearted Alterian benefactor or b a bug in an Alterian ATM Let's suppose that this be a true dichotomy so P a +P b =1 Trouble be Alterius be in a different universe so that no observation of Alterius be possible except for the bank you could n't possibly afford it Now let 's examine the case for a There be no evidence whatsoever that there be any such thing a a big-hearted Alterian benefactor However P exists b-h A b P not exists b-h A b 1 On the ground that lack_of_evidence_for be evidence_against when we have a partition like that we dismiss hypothesis a Turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that hypothesis On the same ground a before we dismiss hypothesis b The problem with this be that we have dismiss *all* of the possible hypothesis and even though we know by construction that the money arrives every month we have proven that it ca n't because we have dismiss all of it potential cause That 's an *extremely* poor argument and here 's why Premise 1 `` ... this money be be paid to you by either a your big- hearted Alterian benefactor or b a bug in an Alterian ATM '' Thus each monthly appearance of the buck should it happen be an observation on Alterius and by construction be evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the ATM Premise 2 no observation on Alterius be possible except for the bank you could n't possibly afford it You forgot to include this My premise be actually Premise 2 The cardinality of the set of possible observation on Alterius be one This be clearly contradictory to the first Not if you state it properly Trouble be on the basis of premise 2 you say that there can be no evidence of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise lead to the conclusion that the appearance of the buck should it happen be evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug Voila a scream contradiction with my highlight SC But in a strawman argument There be only evidence for OneOf Benefactor Bug No observation to distinguish Benefactor from Bug be possible That be ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ not evidence for Bug and neither be it evidence for Benefactor Nor ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ be true to say that this hypothetical universe appear exactly a if there be no Benefactor/Bug two statement both would be false This be still contradictory It reduces to 1 Alterian dosh arrive in my account be due to benefactor or bug 2 this be not evidence for benefactor neither be it evidence for bug meaning that it do n't lend more weight to one than to the other 3 therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence can exist for bug But 3 relies on a shift in meaning from 2 When you say paraphrase in 2 that this be not `` evidence for benefactor '' for example what you mean be that it 's no *more* evidence for benefactor than it be for bug Yes that 's what I mean In 3 however you 've shift the meaning of `` evidence for benefactor '' so that it now mean absolute `` evidence for benefactor '' rather than relative `` evidence for benefactor '' w.r.t bug Not really I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other I think this be just a communication problem What I be try to say in my clumsy way be that while I buy your theory a far a it relates to theism make prediction prayer your 'Rapture example I don't buy your use of Occam 's razor in all case where A=0 In my example one could n't dismiss benefactor or bug on the ground of simplicity one of these be necessary to explain the dosh I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so From what you 're say in this post it seem you agree and we 're talk at cross-purpose 3 be still in contradiction to 1 Some sum may help With B benefactor b bug d dosh arrives in account 1 implies P B+b d 1 Assuming that P Bb d 0 so it 's either the benefactor *or* a bug which be responsible if the buck arrive but not both then P B+b d P B d P b d so P B d P b d 1 but 3 implies that P B d 0 and P b d 0 No this be n't what I meant P B d 0.5 and P b d 0.5 with necessarily no new observation we 've already see the dosh to change those estimate I be try to say again in my clumsy way that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these And that's precisely what use of the Razor do in the case of god god be one class of hypothesis there be many others belonging to a set of hypothesis _one_of_which_ be necessary to explain something which otherwise would _not_ be satisfactorily explain It can be thrown out or retain on ground of non-rational preference not of science or statistic Alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the ground that the answer ca n't be know or that the notional probability estimate be effectively useless be equal agnosticism/weak atheism As they do when the set M be fill by `` the universe be cause by x '' where x be god pink unicorn nothing etc and no observation tends to one conclusion over the other Exactly the point I be make I think So we do n't `` throw out '' any of these contrary to your assertion above that we do Some people do Simon and they think they be do excellent science My sole point be that they be n't Only observation which directly contradict the hypothesis H i i.e x where P x H i 0 can cause P H i to go to zero after a finite number of observation Only in this case do we get to throw any of the hypothesis out Exactly my point though I may have be unclear You say the diametric opposite which I guess be the source of my confusion I be merely try to illustrate the incorrectness of do so What I 'm try to say be that while you be correct to say that absence of evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this do not hold true for all or perhaps any version of theism and it be n't true that those for which it do not hold can be discard use the razor On the contrary those for which it do not hold be *exactly* those which can be discard use the Razor See my post on the other branch of this thread Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of If the razor hold for god then it hold for all like hypothesis Which mean that you 're assign P x H i =0 for all i though we 've already establish that it 's not correct to do so when SUM P x|H i =1 over all i Simply put anyone who claim to have a viable proof of the existence or non-existence of god whether inductive or no be at best mistaken and at bad barking mad Luckily I make no such claim and have specifically say a much on numerous occasion You would n't be construct a strawman here would you Frank Although that do n't of course rule out my be barking mad in any case I could be barking mad in my spare time with apology to Cleese et al But I think you miss the point once again When I say that something be '' evidence against '' an hypothesis that do n't imply that observation of the say something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis reduce the estimate of P H data to zero If it *reduces* this quantity it 's still evidence against H. No I get that I 'm talk about the case when A=0 You 're clearly correct when A =0 And I 'm not construct a strawman though it's certainly possible that I 've misunderstood what you 're say However by any standard a system that say when A=0 god be highly unlikely and when A =0 god can be dismiss use the Razor be a system purport to be an inductive proof that god either do n't exist or be unnecessary to explain any or all phenomenon In my experience system such a this include those which purport to prove that god exist always contain a fallacy upon close examination If that 's not what you 're say then please put me straight
