bissda saturn.wwc.edu DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL writes First I want to start right out and say that I 'm a Christian It make sense to be one Have any of you read Tony Campollo 's book- liar lunatic or the real thing I might be a little off on the title but he writes the book Anyway he be part of an effort to destroy Christianity in the process he become a Christian himself I assume you be post to encourage comment how much history have Tony Campello read Not much it seem The arguements he us I be sum up The book be about whether Jesus be God or not I know many of you do n't believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listen to what others have to say It be good to hear that there be a few reasonable Christians about If only those christian `` scientist '' would take note In Australia there be a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientist who believe that every single event in the bible be exactly true and that there be a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by use the law of physic For example there be a few chap who be try to prove that the age of the universe be 6000 year old and that the error in conventional calculation be the result of the fact that the speed light have be rapidly decay over the year and this have not be account for The book say that Jesus be either a liar or he be crazy a modern day Koresh or he be actually who he say he be Or of course that he never exist and the bible be a story and be never intend to become a manifesto for a billion people Did Tony follow that one up Some reason why he would n't be a liar be a follow Who would die for a lie Would n't people be able to tell if he be a liar People gather around him and kept do it many gather from hearing or see someone who be or have be heal Millions of people have `` die for a lie '' This point be difficult to substantiate since it be not well define a great many religious argument work in that way but consider the many Aztec warrior who sacrifice themselves to their god in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invader The list be endless The Aztecs lose BTW Call me a fool but I believe he do heal people That be perfectly reasonable but it be not ground for me or anyone to become a christian More to the point it do not add weight to the claim that Jesus be the `` real thing '' Niether be he a lunatic Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who be crazy Very doubtful in fact rediculous For example anyone who be drawn to David Koresh be obviously a fool logical people see this right away Have you ever see a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany More to the point do Tony mention this One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleague fool or illogical men their support of Hitler be base I presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principle Obviously my argument be invalid if Tony thought that Hitler be sane ... Therefore since he be n't a liar or a lunatic he must have be the real thing Hmmm ... I do n't think his argument warrant the use of a `` Therefore ... '' Some other thing to note He fulfil load of prophecy in the psalm Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hr alone This in his betrayal and Crucifixion I do n't have my Bible with me at this moment next time I write I will use it This be unfortunately what alot of religious discussion I have have with people result in quote the bible The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible be to treat the story a some sort of metaphorical representation of the message that the author be try to present If someone try to interpret part of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sort of shit Tony 's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the event described in the bible take place but to convince someone who think the bible be total fiction that Jesus be real by quote the book be totally pointless For example in mathematics you can not say `` a be equal to b because a be equal to b '' I do n't think most people understand what a Christian be That would possibly explain why there have so many people be kill in religious war and why there be hundred of different version all claim to be correct It be certainly not what I see a lot in church Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God 's sake He love u enough to die and save u so we should do the same Hey we ca n't do it God himself inspires u to turn our life over to him That 's tuff and most people do n't want to do it to be a real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at But just like weight lift or guitar play drum whatever it take time We do n't rush it in one day Christianity be your whole life It be not go to church once a week or help poor people once in a while We box everything into time unit Such a work at this time sport Tv social life God be above these box and should be carry with u into all these box that we have create for ourselves I think if you post this part to alt.religion you would get more flame than here I have never really understood why the emotional sentiment of a stranger should be of interest to other people Someone famous say that there two evil in life polititians and church one rule by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead If I be press I could probably find the exact quotation

Where be the evidence for my opinion At the moment there be just generality I can cite For example I read that in the 20th century the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from depression have be steadily climb in Western society probably what I be reading refer particularly to the USA Similarly one can detect a trend towards great occurrence of sex outside of marriage in this century in Western society -- particularly with the `` sexual revolution '' of the 60 's but even before that I think otherwise the `` sexual revolution '' of the 60 's would not have be possible particularly with the gradual weaken of Christianity and consequently Christian moral teaching against sex outside of marriage I propose that these two trend -- great level of general depression in society and other psychological problem and great sexual promiscuity -- be link with the latter be a prime cause of the former I can not provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis seem very reasonable to me and I request that people ponder upon it Fred Rice -- a Muslim give his point of view darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au I think this be a big leap sex- depression One example be myself where no sex- depression But seriously 1 promiscuity be on a decline depression be not and 2 it might be more reasonable to say depression- promiscuity I think depression be more likely to come from emotional problem relationship family job friend and promiscuity be use a an escape Since I see marriage a a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond I do n't see a problem with sex before not outside of marriage so long a you have the same commitment and devotion a what be expect from a married couple Of course this be just my opinion

Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor Bosnia or even Tibet If Iraq be so bad why be we still sell them stuff a couple of week before we start bombing I make no claim or effort to justify the misguide foreign policy of the West before the war It be evident that the West especially America misjudge Hussein drastically But once Hussein invade Kuwait and threaten to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply he have to be stop Oh I see So we can overlook his use chemical weapon on thousand of people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gas-guzzling car well the man 's get ta go Actually it be the fact that both situation exist that prompt US and allied action If some back-water country take over some other back-water country we probably would n't intervene Not that we don't care but we ca n't be the world 's policman Or if a coup have occur in Kuwait instead of an invasion then we still would n't have act because there would not have be the imminent danger perceive to Saudi Arabia But the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West 's oil interest cause u to take action I 've move a paragraph from here to later on ... If we have n't intervene allow Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would have be appeasement Right But do you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action Or be you just set up a strawman I 'm not set up a strawman at all If you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative be to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait Diplomatic alternative include sanction be ineffective I guess we should n't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilian kill in Dresden and Hamburg Yes do Germans be human too you know Sure What be truly unfortunate be that they follow Hitler in his grandiose quest for a `` Thousand Year Reich '' The consequence stem from that Translation `` They be ask for it '' Well in a sense yes They probably have no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to But what about those who do n't support Hitler 's dream of conquest It's not a if they democratically vote for all his policy The NSDAP get 43 in the election of 1933 and that be the last chance the German people get to vote on the matter They suffer along with the rest Why do this bother you so much The world be full of evil and circumstance be not perfect Many innocent suffer due to the wrongful action of others It it regretable but that 's The-Way-It-Is There be no perfect solution ... I look forward to hearing your incisive comment about East Timor and Tibet What should I say about them Anything in particular The people of East Timor be still be kill by a dictatorship that invade their country Hell even Western journalist have be kill All this be happen before the Gulf War Why do n't we send in the bomber to East Timor Why be n't we send in the bomber NOW Probably because we 're not the savior of the world We ca n't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another Nor be we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or some other place Here 's that paragraph I move What 's your intent To sound like a Loving Christian Well you aren't do a very good job of it Well it 's not very `` love '' to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby country and keep them Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain people under their dominion So I 'd have to say yes stop Hussein be the most `` love '' thing to do for the most people involve once he set his mind on military conquest The Chinese government have a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of Tibetans Tibetan people be round up torture and execute Amnesty International recently report that torture be still widespread in China Why be n't we stop them In fact why be we actively suck up to them by trading freely with them Tell me how we could stop them and I 'll support it I for one do not agree with the present US policy of `` suck up to them '' a you put it I agree that it be deplorable And a for poor poor Rodney King Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of `` not guilty '' Yes Amongst the thing I thought be `` Hmm there 's an awful lot of white people in that jury '' So It be the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King Erm surely it 's irrelevant who 's on trial Juries be suppose to represent a cross-section of the population Are they Or be they suppose to reflect the population of the locale where the trial be held Normally this be where the crime be commit unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue be in order I 'm not an expert on California law or even US law but it seem that this be the way the system be set up You can criticize the system but let 's not have unfounded allegation of racial prejudice thrown around And under American law they deserve a jury of *their* peer You be say that black people be not the peer of white people No not at all The point be that the fact that there be no black on the first jury and that Rodney King be black be totally irrelevant This point of allegedly racial motivation be really shallow This idea of people only be try before a jury of people just like them be really stupid Should the Nuremburg trial have have a jury entirely make up of Nazis Germans perhaps `` Peers '' do n't mean `` those who do the same thing '' like have murderer judge murderer It mean `` have people from the same station in life '' presumably because they be in a well position to understand the defendent 's motivation s Those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no far than the video tape But the jury look at *all* the evidence evidence which you and I have not see When I see a bunch of policeman beating someone who 's lie defenceless on the ground it 's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have be So It 's `` hard to imagine '' So when have Argument from Incredulity gain acceptance from the revere author of `` Constructing a Logical Argument '' We 're not talk about a logical argument We 're talk about a court of law As the FAQ point out some fallacious argument be not view a fallacy in a court of law OK grant However you be use this reason a part of *your* logical argument in this discussion This be not a court of law If the fact a the news commentator present them be true then I feel the `` not guilty '' verdict be a reasonable one Were you not talk earlier about the bias of the liberal medium conspiracy The medium be not totally monolithic Even though there be a prevail liberal bias program such a the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balance and fair reporting of the news There be even conservative source out there if you know where to look Hurrah for Rush BTW I never use the word ``

both side be go to suffer and die I do n't say it be OK -- it be unfortunate but sometimes necessary I a moral relativist be argue that saturation bombing of German city at the end of World War II be a far a I can see an evil and unnecessary act I would agree that it be evil in the sense that it cause much pain and suffer I 'm not so sure that it be unnecessary a you say That conclusion can only be arrive at by evaluate all the factor involve And perhaps it *was* unnecessary a let 's say we now know That doesn't mean that those who have to make the decision to bomb do n't see it a be necessary Rarely can one have full know of the consequence of an action before make a decision At the time it may have seem necessary enough to go ahead with it But do n't assume that I feel the bombing be *morally* justified -- I do n't I just do n't condemn those who have to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstance You have criticise moral relativism in the past be now argue that I be in no position to judge the morality of allied action at the end of the War You certainly be not in such a position if you be a moral relativist I a an absolutist be in a position to judge but I defer judgment You be argue that the action need to be assess in the particular context of the time and that they might have be moral then but not moral now Wrong They be neither moral then nor now They seem necessary to those make the decision to bring a quick end to the war I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision Where 's your Christian love Where 's your absolute morality Oh how quick you be to discard them when it suit you As Ivan Stang would say `` Jesus would puke '' One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum I understand the full ramification of that and I be prepared to do so I do n't believe that you can make the same claim mathew And BTW the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany be because you be bemoan the Iraqi civilian casualty a be '' so deplorable '' Yet blanket bombing be institute because bombing be n't accurate enough to hit industrial/military target in a decisive way by any other method at that time But in the Gulf War precision bombing be the norm So the point be why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualty that result *in spite of* precision bombing when so many more civilian proportionately and quantitatively die under the blanket bombing in WW2 Even with precision bombing mistake happen and some civilian suffer But less civilian suffer in this war than any other iany other in history Many Iraqi civilian go about their life with minimal interference from the allied air raid The story of `` hundred of thousand '' of Iraqi civilian dead be just plain bunk Yes bunk The US lose 230,000 serviceman in WW2 over four year and the majority of them be directly involve in fight But we be expect to swallow that `` hundred of thousand '' of *civilian* Iraqis die in a war last about 2 month And with the Allies use the most precise bomb ever create at that What hogwash If `` hundred of thousand '' of Iraqi civilian die it be due to action Hussein take on his own people not due to the Allied bombing Regards

mantis.co.uk writes Yes Fortunately we have right-thinking folk like your good self in power and it be therefore deem acceptable to slaughter ten or even hundred o thousand of Iraqis in order to liberate oil^H^H^HKuwait We won the war hurrah hurrah The number of civilian Iraqi death be way over-exaggerated and exploit for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news medium The fact be that less Iraqis die in the Gulf War than do civilian in any other war of comparable size this century Let 's analyze this claim a little How be the `` size '' of a war define By number of participant Geographical area Number of country involve Number of casualty Size of army duration number of casualty both absolute and a a percentage of those involve geographical area and number of country too be all measure of size In this case I 'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatant total troop compare to total casualty from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area Which other `` comparable '' war be we talk about Vietnam and Korea might make good comparison Which `` liberal news medium '' be we talk about Western news in general but in particular the American `` mass medium '' CBS NBC ABC etc The general tone of the news during the whole war be one of `` those poor poor Iraqis '' along with `` look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bit '' This be due mostly to the short duration couple with precise surgical bombing technique which be technically possible only recently I suspect that medical advance may have something to do with it too I agree How about all the innocent people who die in blanket-bombing in WW2 I do n't hear you bemoan them Perhaps because the topic have n't cropped up If you want my opinion I think that the blanket bombing of German city at the end of World War Two be the most appal act of wholesale slaughter this country have commit in century Bomber Harris be no hero of mine Perhaps so And maybe the atomic bomb be a mistake too But that 's easy to say from our `` enlighten '' viewpoint here in the 90 's right Back then it be *all-out* war and Germany and Japan have to be squash After all a million or more British have already die hundred of thousand of French a couple hundread thousand or so Americans and million of Russians not to mention a few million Jews Poles and other people of slavic descent in German concentration camp All thing consider the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb be essential and therefore justified in bring the war to a quick end to avoid even great allied loss I for one do n't regret it War be never an exact science but with smart bomb it 's become more exact with a small percentage of civilian casualty Sometimes mistake be make target be misidentified innocent die That 's war the way it really be Entrenched political ruler operating in their own selfish interest without regard for the life of other people *that* be the way war really be Sure And it 's the people who suffer because of them All the more reason to depose these `` entrench political ruler operating in their own selfish interest '' Or do you mean that this applies to the ally a well Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor Bosnia or even Tibet If Iraq be so bad why be we still sell them stuff a couple of week before we start bombing I make no claim or effort to justify the misguide foreign policy of the West before the war It be evident that the West especially America misjudge Hussein drastically But once Hussein invade Kuwait and threaten to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply he have to be stop Sure the war could have be prevent by judicious and concert effort on the part of the West before Hussein invade Kuwait but it be still *Hussein* who be responsible for his decision to invade And once he do so a strong response from the West be require Mathew your sarcasm be note but you be completely off-base here You come off sound like a complete peace-nik idiot although I feel sure that be not your intent What 's your intent To sound like a Loving Christian Well you aren't do a very good job of it Well it 's not very `` love '' to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby country and keep them Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain people under their dominion So I 'd have to say yes stop Hussein be the most `` love '' thing to do for the most people involve once he set his mind on military conquest So the Iraqi war be wrong eh I 'm sure that appeasement would have work well than war just like it do in WW2 eh Who even mention appeasement And what make you think the situation be even remotely analogous to World War Two I mention it If we have n't intervene allow Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would have be appeasement It be precisely the lesson the world learn in WW2 that motivate the Western alliance to war Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia do not stop WW2 from happen and let Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stop an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia I guess we should n't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilian kill in Dresden and Hamburg Yes do Germans be human too you know Sure What be truly unfortunate be that they follow Hitler in his grandiose quest for a `` Thousand Year Reich '' The consequence stem from that Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stop His kind do n't understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun My only regret be that Bush wimped out and do n't have the military roll into Baghdad so now Hussein be still in power and the Iraqi people 's sacrifice not to mention the 357 Americans who die be for naught I look forward to hearing your incisive comment about East Timor and Tibet What should I say about them Anything in particular And a for poor poor Rodney King Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of `` not guilty '' Yes Amongst the thing I thought be `` Hmm there 's an awful lot of white people in that jury '' So It be the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King And under American law they deserve a jury of *their* peer If there have be black officer involve I 'm sure their would have be black juror too This point of allegedly racial motivation be really shallow Those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no far than the video tape But the jury look at *all* the evidence evidence which you and I have not see When I see a bunch of policeman beating someone who 's lie defenceless on the ground it 's rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have be So It 's `` hard to imagine '' So when have Argument from Incredulity gain acceptance from the revere author of `` Constructing a Logical Argument '' Can we expect another revision soon Just kid If there be some wonderful evidence why be it seemingly be kept secret Why not tell everyone what it be Then everyone could say `` Oh yes you're right King deserve a good beating '' and we could all live happily ever after I have to admit that I wonder this too But *neither* the prosecution nor the defense be talk So one can not conclude either way due to the silence of the principal Law in this country be intend to protect the right of the accuse whether they be criminal or cop One be not found guilty if there be a reasonable doubt of one 's guilt and only the jury be in a position to ass the evidence and render a verdict Fine but I 'm still find it hard to imagine what the `` reasonable doubt '' be in this case I mean the cop certainly seem to be beating someone who 's lie defenceless on the ground What 's your explanation Mass hallucination Orbital mind-control laser Faked video footage Do tell OK It certainly seem to me that there be excessive force involve And frankly the original `` not guilty '' verdict baffle me too But then I learn that the prosecution in the first case do not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they try to get a conviction on a charge of aggravate assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm A charge which news commentator say be akin to attempt murder under California law Based on what the prosecution be ask for it 's evident that the first jury decide that the officer be `` not guilty '' Note not `` not guilty '' of do wrong but `` not guilty '' of aggravate assault with the *intent* of inflict serious bodily harm The seed of the prosecution defeat be in their own overconfidence in obtain a verdict such that they go for the most extreme charge they could If the fact a the news commentator present them be true then I feel the `` not guilty '' verdict be a reasonable one mathew `` Thou shalt not kill ... unless thou hast a pretty good reason for kill in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who get in the way a unfortunately it can not be help '' -- Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians Thanks mathew I like the quote Pretty funny actually I 'm a Monty Python fan you know Kind of seem in that vein Of course oversimplify any moral argument can make it seem contradictory But then you know that already Regards

timmbake mcl.ucsb.edu Bake Timmons writes Atheism denies the existence of God This be logically bankrupt -- where be the proof of this nonexistence It 's a joke This be one of my favorite fallacious point against atheism i.e the belief that you ca n't deny anything that you ca n't prove do n't exist This be easily nail by show that an infinite number of being be conceivable but not observe to exist do this mean that we would have to believe in all of them According to the above poster we must believe in object or being that have n't be prove not to exist so why stop at God there could be a huge number of being identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial difference say one be miss a finger one have blond hair ... and they all live on other planet so we ca n't see them The reason no one but atheist bring this up be that none of these christian have a vested interest in these unknown being with the exception of God Fine but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of a God Here again be a classic atheist fallacy How do they shoot themselves in the foot Radical Muslims the Crusades the Inquisition be common example that atheist like to bring up a mark against religion How weak Only fool can take that drivel seriously How about the grand-daddy of all human atrocity the Stalinist movement Twenty eight MILLION people _killed_ under this leadership which proudly feature atheism There be a big difference here Stalin do n't say that he stood for a particular moral position i.e against murder and terrorism etc and then do the opposite like the religious movement he be at least an honest killer This be NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint Saying that atheism support murder and violence just because one man be a tyrant and an atheist be just bad logic look at all the russian that help Stalin that be n't atheist do n't they contradict your point Besides your point assumes that his atheism be relevant to his murder people this be just the common assumption that atheist ca n't value life a much a theist which you do n't support Agnostics be not a funny because they be more reasonable Yet they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of God be unknowable This in itself be every bit the assumption that atheism be though it 's less arrogant and pompous Ah and here 's another point you do n't get out of the FAQ An atheist do n't have to hold the positive view that god do n't exist he/she may just have the non-existence of the positive belief Here 's the example Strong atheism `` I believe god do not exist '' a positive belief Weak atheism `` I do n't believe in a god '' a negative belief these be NOT the same some one that have never thought of the idea of god in their whole life be technically an atheist but not the kind that you be call unreasonable Or let 's look at it this way in set suppose that a give person have a huge set of idea that I will represent a capital letter and these people then either believe that these idea exist a real object or not So if S santa then E S no be the person not believe in santa but still have the idea of santa But notice that even E S no be itself another idea This mean you have lot of case christian A E A =yes B E B =no G E G =yes ... ... where G god atheist strong A E A .G E G =no atheist weak A ... ..E i.e no G at all in the set agnostic A ... ... .G E G indeterminate E ... Why be people so afraid to say `` undecided '' It must just be another feature of human nature -- `` undecided '' be not a sexy trendy or glamorous word It do not inspire much hate or conflict It 's not blasphemous It 's not political In fact it be too often take to mean unsophisticated Nietzsche once say that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this be that humanity always prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision be not a useful survival trait evolution have drill it in u to take position even false one Bake Timmons III

Plus question for you why do subjectivists/relativists/nihilists get so het up about the idea that relativism be *better* than objectivism To the degree that relativism be a more accurate decription of the truth than be objectivism it provide more power and ability to control event I think you lose the right to talk about THE truth once you say value be relative Accuracy be a value judgement too It so happens I agree with the substance of what you say below but it 's clear to me that at least *some* value be objective Truth be well than falsehood peace be well than war education be well than ignorance We know these thing if we know anything While I 'll agree that these be generally held to be `` good thing '' I question whether they come very close to be objective value Especially consider that at one time or another each have be view a be undesirable I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be say to be universally `` good '' or `` bad '' And when I refer to `` the truth '' I be use the term hypothetically realize full well that there may not even be such a thing Assuming for the moment that moral _are_ relative then two relativists can recognize that neither have a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produce the desire result No they can not because they acknowledge up front that THE desire result do not exist That after all be the meaning of compromise Plus some problem If the relativists have no value in common compromise be impossible what happens then Who if anyone be right What happens if one relativist have a value `` Never compromise '' A value `` plant bomb in crowd shopping area '' After all if moral be relative these value can not *meaningfully* be say to be incorrect True enough But they can not be say to be anything more than personal moral One thing notably lack in most extremist be any sense of _personal_ accountability the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour be invariably some `` high authority '' aka absolute moral truth Assuming that there be an absolute morality two disagree objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right there be no room for compromise Once you beleive in absolute moral you must accept that you be amoral or that everyone who disagrees with you be amoral Untrue One can accept that one do not know the whole truth Part of the objective truth about morality may well be that flexibility be well than rigidity compromise be well than believe you have a lock on moral etc In the same way I can believe in an objective reality without claim to know the mechanism for quantum collapse or who shot JFK An objective truth that say one can not know the objective truth Interesting notion Certainly one can have a one 's moral a belief that compromise be good But to compromise on the absolute truth be not something most people do very successfully I suppose one could hold compromise a be an absolute moral but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise How do you compromise on compromise Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention I 'd say that compromise seem to be `` well '' And I would agree But it 's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it's merely a matter of taste Is your like for peace any well found than someone else 's like for ice-cream I 'm look for a way to say '' yes '' to that question and relativism be n't it Almost invariably when consider the relative value of one thing over another be it moral or consequence people only consider those aspect which justify a desire action or belief In justify a commitement to peace I might argue that it let people live long healthy and peaceful life While that much may well be true it be incomplete in ignore the benefit of war kill off the most agressive member of society trim down the population stimulate production The equation be always more complex than present To characterize relative moral a merely follow one 's own conscience desire be to unduly simplify it

Each one be travel with an orbit in it own motion '' Also note that `` the celestial body '' in the first translation quote by you above be the translator 's interpolation -- it be not existent in the original Arabic which be why it be include in bracket Perhaps someone who can read the original Arabic can eliminate one of these interpretation at any rate neither one of them be exactly impressive You 're right what the verse _do_ contain be n't all that remarkable However Dr. Bucaille a surgeon that 's how he 's a `` Dr. '' think it be significant that the above verse contains no geocentric idea even though geocentrism be all the rage up until the 17th century or so And this go for the rest of the Qur'an a well which have about 750 verse or so regard nature I think I remember reading once

Divine justice According to the most fundamental doctrine of Christianity When the first man sin he be at that time the You accuse him of reference mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology This time meeting all the requirement of myth salvation The idea of punishment be base on the proposition that everyone know instinctively that God exists be their creator and Ah but not everyone `` know '' that god exists So you have a fallacy There 's nothing terribly difficult in all this and be well know to any reasonably Biblically literate Christian The only controversy be And that make it true Holding with the Bible rule out controversy Read the FAQ If you 've read it you miss something so re-read Not a bad suggestion for anyone ... I re-read it just before this with those who pretend not to know what be be say and what it mean When atheist claim that they do -not- know if God exists and do n't know what He want they contradict the Bible which clearly say that -everyone- know The authority of the Bible be it claim to be ... should I repeat what I write above for the sake of get it across You may trust the Bible but your trust it doesn't make it any more credible to me If the Bible say that everyone know that 's clearly reason to doubt the Bible because not everyone `` know '' your allege god 's allege existance refute while the species-wide condemnation be justified Those that claim that there be no evidence for the existence of God or that His will be unknown must deliberately ignore the Bible the ignorance itself be no excuse 1 No they do n't have to ignore the Bible The Bible be far from universally accepted The Bible be NOT a proof of god it be only a proof that some people have thought that there be a god Or do it prove even that They might have be write it a series of fiction short-stories As in the case of Dionetics Assuming the writer believe it the only thing it could possibly prove be that they believe it And that 's ignore the problem of whether or not all the interpretation and Biblical-philosophers be correct 2 There be people who have truly never heard of the Bible 3 Again read the FAQ freedom You be free to ignore God in the same way you be free to ignore gravity and the consequence be inevitable and well know in both case That an atheist ca n't accept the evidence mean only Bzzt ... wrong answer Gravity be directly THERE It do n't stop exert a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it God on the other hand do n't generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloid God do n't exert a rationally undeniable influence Gravity be obvious god be n't Secondly human reason be very comforatble with the concept of God so much so that it be in itself intrinsic to our nature Human reason always come back to the question of God in every generation and in No human reason have n't always come back to the existance of '' God '' it have usually come back to the existance of `` god '' In other word it do n't generally come back to the xtian god it come back to whether there be any god And in much of oriental philosophic history it generally do n't pop up a the idea of a god so much a the question of what natural force be and which one be out there From a world-wide view human nature just make u wonder how the universe come to be and/or what force s be currently in control A natural tendancy to believe in `` God '' only exists in religious wishful think I say all this to make the point that Christianity be eminently reasonable that Divine justice be just and human nature be much different than what atheist think it be Whether you agree or not Xtianity be no more reasonable than most other religion and it 's reasonableness certainly do n't merit eminence Divine justice ... well it only seem just to those who already believe in the divinity First not all atheist believe the same thing about human nature Second whether most atheist be correct or not YOU certainly be not correct on human nature You be at the least base your view on a completely eurocentric approach Try look at the outside world a well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity

cmtan iss.nus.sg Tan Chade Meng dan writes I somewhat agree with u However what it come to theist religion it 's a different matter That 's because religion be like a drug once u use it it 's very difficult to get out of it That 's because in order to experience a religion u necessarily have to have blind faith and once u have the blind faith it 's very diffcult for you to reason yourself back to atheism again Therefore it 's unreasonable to ask people to try religion in order to judge it It 's like ask people to `` try die to find out what death be like '' Well now we ca n't judge death until we be dead right So why should we judge religion without have experienced it People have say that religion be bad by any account and that it be in no way useful etc. but I do n't totally agree with this Of course we can not really say how the religious folk would act have they not be expose to religion but some people at least seem to be help in some way by it So basically we can not judge whether religion be the right route for a give individual or even for a general population We can say that it be not best for u personally at least you can choose not to use religion -- might be hard to try to find out it benefit a you state above

You CAN NOT escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe be our sens and our reason period Again this be indefensible No it be simple truth I challenge you to show me otherwise then later ... Few mystic will agree to this assertion and the common defense of redefine `` sens '' to absorb for instance mystical experience be begs the question of whether some sens be well than others I allow you the broad definition of sens to make thing easy for you Now show me that `` mystical experience '' exist Remember you be n't allow to go by testimony of others e.g. mystic since you have dismiss my testimony a unreliable you know taint by my own bias Further once these mystical thingies be absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that person 's reason capability I challenge you to show me these thing If you can not do so you might a well give up the fight then later ... Let me reiterate you have NOT explain your interpretation of your experience so it be not possible for me to have attack them In point of fact I specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you be talk about and I note for the record that you appear to have decline my challenge *What* be it *How* be it sense *How* be it interpret And *how* do this sense and interpretation occur without the conduit of our sens and reason ability You have answer none of these question that go straight to the heart of your claim If you ca n't answer them your claim be entirely specious 3 You have state that all claim to dispassionate analysis make by a.a poster be unverifiable and fantastical I ask you to identify one such claim that I have make You have fail to do so Please do so now Question Have I make any claim at all that be unverifiable and fantastical If so please repeat them Here be the context for the question I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong post then later ... Likewise the reference to `` unverifiable fantastical claim '' represent fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claim to dispassionate analysis that be repeat in this group Give me your address and I 'll be pleased to send you a dictionary Failing that can you name ONE claim that I have make that be in any sense unverifiable or fantastical I demand that you retract this statement if you can not offer up evidence If you follow your usual pattern of ignore the challenge then you be simply an asshole 4 First you dismiss claim by atheist that they become atheist a a result of reason then later you state that if one accepted the '' axiom '' of reason that one could n't help but become atheist I ask you to explain the contradiction Your only response be a statement that the question be incoherent an opinion not share by others that I have ask be they atheist or theist You have fail to answer the question Please do so now Question Do you retract your claim that a.a poster have not become atheist a a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect If you do n't retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axiom of reason inevitably result in atheism Here be the context for the question First quote ... we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position be base on reason ... it be up to atheist to prove it to me ... then Second quote ... but I do not see how one can accept these axiom and not end up with an atheistic point of view 5 First you claimed that you would probably not answer these Challenges because they contain too much in the way of `` include text '' from previous post Later you imply that you wouldn't respond because I be put word in your mouth Please clarify this seem contradiction Question Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own post or that I paraphrase your position in order to avoid `` include text '' Here be the context for the question First you say My ordinary rule be that I do n't read article over over 150 line or article in which there be nothing but include text on the first screen THese be not rule of morality but practicality then later ...

I 've say enough time that there be no `` alternative '' that should think you might have caught on by now And there be no `` alternative '' but the point be `` rationality '' be n't an alternative either The problem of metaphysical and religious knowledge be unsolvable -- or I should say human can not solve them If there be truly no alternative then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim The usual line here which you call `` a prejudgment of atheism '' and dispute be that reason be all we have Here you admit that you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim that there be anything other than reason or that reason be inapplicable in religious knowledge except possibly that reason conflict with '' religious knowledge '' This sound very much like `` I ca n't provide a rational defense for my belief but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it may be false '' I hope it make you happy but your repeat and unfounded assertion to this effect do n't advance your cause

There be a good deal more confusion here You start off with the assertion that there be some `` objective '' morality and a you admit here you finish up with a recursive definition Murder be '' objectively '' immoral but eactly what be murder and what be not itself require an appeal to morality I think you mean circular not recursive but that be semantics Recursiveness have no problem it be just horribly inefficient just ask any assembly programmer Yes Now you have switch target a little but only a little Now you be ask what be the `` goal '' What do you mean by `` goal '' Are you suggest that there be some `` objective '' `` goal '' out there somewhere and we form our moral to achieve it Well for example the goal of `` natural '' morality be the survival and propogation of the specie Another example of a moral system be present within the Declaration of Independence which state that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness You see to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system That be we shall be moral unto what end The oft-quoted line that say people should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a inalienable right be a complete lie and deception a the very author of that line be in the process of prove Liberty be never free it be always purchase at some cost almost always at the cost to another Whos liberty be more inalienable Similarly for right of life When one person must die if he be to save another or even a group of others who life be more inalienable That lead into the classic question of the value of the death penalty especially for serial killer Whos life and liberty be more valuable the serial killer or the victim According to that beautiful line those two right should be completely inviolate that be noone should be able to remove them This _includes_ government Admittedly the serial killer have restrict some people 's life and/or liberty but be not his own life/liberty inviolate also According to the declaration of independence it be Murder be certainly a violation of the golden rule And I thought I have define murder a an intentional kill of a non-murderer against his will Oooh I like that It mean that kill an infant be not murder because it can not be against it will Reason an infant have no will a such Similarly for people who be brain dead easy to see in a coma etc Also under current law accidental kill be still murder How will you include that And you respond to this by ask whether or not the execution of an innocent person under our system of capital punishment be a murder or not I fail to see what this have to do with anything I never claimed that our system of morality be an objective one I thought that be your very first claim That there be some kind of `` objective '' morality and that an example of that be that murder be wrong If you do n't want to claim that any more that 's fine The only real golden rule in life be he who have the gold make the rule I.e Might Makes Right That be survival Now what be wrong with that Well murder violates the golen rule which be certainly a pillar of most every moral system However I be not assume that our current system and the manner of it implementation be objectively moral I think that it be a very good approximation but we ca n't be perfect If you mean the golden rule a I state yes almost every system a implement have use that in reality Sorry I do n't deal a much in fiction a I do in reality And by the way you do n't seem to understand the difference between '' arbitrary '' and `` objective '' If Keith Schneider `` defines '' murder to be this that and the other that 's arbitrary Jon Livesey may still say `` Well accord to my personal system of morality all kill of human against their will be murder and wrong and what the legal definition of murder may be in the USA Kuweit Saudi Arabia or the PRC may be matter not a whit to me '' WELCOME TO OZLAND What be NOT arbitrary If you can find some part of society some societal rule moral etc that be not arbitrary please tell me I do n't think there be any Well `` objective '' would assume a system base on clear and fundamental concept while `` arbitary '' implies no clear line of reason keith Sounds like euphemism to me The difference seem to be that objective be some reason that I like while arbitrary be some reason that I do n't like OR do n't understand

reference line trim SSAUYET eagle.wesleyan.edu SCOTT D. SAUYET writes First I 'll make the assumption that you agree that a murderer be one who have commit murder Well I 'd say that a murderer be one who intentionally commit a murder For instance if you put a bullet into a gun that be thought to contain blank and someone be kill with such a gun the person who actually perform the action be n't the murderer but I guess this be actually make clear in the below definition I 'd be interested to see a more reasonable definition What do you mean by `` reasonable '' Otherwise your inductive definition do n't bottom out Your definition in essence be that Murder be the intentional kill of someone who have not commit murder against his will Expanding the second occurence of murder in the above we see that ... Yes it be bad to include the word be define in the definition But even though the series be recursively infinite I think the meaning can still be deduce I assume you can see the problem here To do a correct inductive definition you must define something in term of a simpler case and you must have one or several `` bottoming out '' case For instance we can define the factorial function the function which assigns to a positive integer the product of the positive integer less than or equal to it on the positive integer inductively a follow math lesson delete Okay let 's look at this situation suppose there be a longstanding feud between two family which claim that the other commit some travesty in the distant past Each time a member of the one family kill a member of the other the other family think that it be justified in kill a that member of the first family Now let 's suppose that this sequence have occur an infinite number of time Or if you don't like deal with infinity suppose that one member of the family go back into time and essentially begin the whole thing That be there be a never-ending loop of slaying base on some non-existent travesty How do you resolve this Well they be all murder Now I suppose that this be n't totally applicable to your `` problem '' but it still be possible to reduce an uninduced system And in any case the nest `` murderer '' in the definition of murder can not be infintely recursive give the finite existence of humanity And a murder can not be commit without a kill involve So the first person to intentionally cause someone to get kill be necessarily a murderer Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition See in a totally objective system where all the information be available such a nest definition be n't really a problem

What about the Twelve Imams who he consider incapable of error or sin Khomeini support this view of the Twelve Imans This be heresy for the very reason I give above I would be happy to discus the issue of the 12 Imams with you although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate The topic be deeply embed in the world view of Islam and the esoteric teaching of the Prophet S.A. Heresy do not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only a an exoteric religion that be only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical substance of man 's be and nature A good introductory book in fact one of the best introductory book to Islam in general be Murtaza Mutahhari 's `` Fundamental's of Islamic Thought God Man and the Universe '' Mizan Press translate by R. Campbell Truly a beautiful book A follow-up book if you can find a decent translation be `` Wilaya The Station of the Master '' by the same author I think it also go under the title of `` Master and Mastership '' It 's a very small book really just a transcription of a lecture by the author The introduction to the beautiful `` Psalms of Islam '' translate by William C. Chittick available through Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain be also an excellent introduction to the subject We have these book in our University library I imagine any well stock University library will have them From your post you seem fairly well verse in Sunni thought You should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable Shi'ite author a well at least that much respect be due before the charge of heresy be level

The death penalty be conceive a a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigan that have be add automatic appeal lengthy court battle etc have relegate that purpose to a very small part of what it should be Hence the question be do we instate the death penalty a it be meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely I doubt the death penalty be suppose to be a `` deterrent '' to crime If so why do n't every crime carry a death penalty That would be effictive would n't it The death penalty be a punishment much like a 50 fine for speed be a punishment Anyway somebody with murder on the mind do n't much care about the consequence I think another problem be that people dont think they will get caught If I want to kill another person I would n't care what the penalty be if I do n't think I would get caught If it be to be strictly a deterrent it should have be more along the line of torture
In article 1993Apr5.165233.1007 news.unomaha.edu trajan cwis.unomaha.edu Stephen McIntyre writes Of course Bobby then state that Satan have no free will that he do a God want him to This brings up a host of paradox be God therefore evil do I have free will or be God direct me also if God be evil which part of his infinite self be good and which be evil etc. I would like for once a solid answer not a run-about I hope I give you a fairly solid answer to this one I simply do n't agree with the embody version of a Satan who be a separate creation or a force I write The belief to which I ascribe be that evil be not a creation rather it be `` the absence of good '' This fit with all the logic about thing have dual use e.g. a knife can be use to sculpt and it can be use to kill Like entropy evil be see in this view a neither force nor entity Satan be therefore metaphorical In fact there be several verse of the Holy Qur'an which appear to support this view and several Traditions a well For example there be a Tradition that food should never be left open on a shelf or table overnight l `` Satan '' enter it It appear that this be a reference to a yet undiscovered germ thus the evil effect of spoil food be described a `` Satan '' But there be many example of Satan personify Which be I to believe And there be quite physical description of Heaven and Hell in the Holy Qur'an the Bible etc There have be time in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical description of Heaven Hell and Satan be take quite literally and that *worked* for the time As I mention in the Tradition cite above for example it be sufficient in the absence of a theory about germ and disease spread by worm to simply describe the `` evil '' which be pass to a consumer of spoil food a `` satanic '' Which begs the question if Satan in this case be metaphorical how can you be certain Allah be not the same way The bottom line here however be that describe a spiritual plane in human language be something like describe `` color '' to a person who have be blind from birth You may want to read the book FLATLAND if you have n't already or THE DRAGON 'S EGG The first be intend a a light hearted description of a mathematical con- cept ... some delete for space save When language fails because it can not be use to adequately describe another dimension which can not be experienced by the speaker then such convention a metaphor allegory and the like come to be necessary The `` unseen '' be described in term which have reference and meaning for the reader/listener But like all model a compro- mise must be make when speak metaphorically clarity and directness of meaning equivalence of perception and the like be all cripple But what else can you do This be why I ask the above How would you then know God exists a a spirit or be rather than just be metaphorical I mean it 's okay to say `` well Satan be just metaphorical '' but then you have to justify this belief AND justify that God be not some metaphor for something else I say this because there be many many instance of Satan described a a be such a the tormentor in the Old Testament book of Job or the temptor in the New Testament Gospels In the same way God too be described a a be or spirit How be I to know one be metaphorical and not the other Further belief in God be n't a bar to evil Let's consider the case of Satanists even if Satan be metaphorical the Satanist would have to believe in God to justify this belief Again we have a case where someone do believe in God but by religious standard they be `` evil '' If Bobby do see this let him address this question also delete some more on `` metaphor '' Obviously more philosophize on this issue be possible but I'm not sure that the reader of this newsgroup would want to delve into religious interpretation far However if anyone wish to discus this I 'm certainly willing either off line e-mail or on line post Stephen _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ Atheist _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ Libertarian _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ Pro-individuality _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ Pro-responsibility _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ Jr. and all that jazz ...

Tony Lezard tony mantis.co.uk writes My opinion be that the strong atheist position require too much belief for me to be comfortable with Any strong atheist out there care to comment As far a I can tell strong atheist be far outnumber on alt.atheism by weak atheist At the cost of repudiate the FAQ I think too much be make of the strong v weak atheism issue although in the context of alt.atheism where we 're continually attack on the basis that strong atheist '' believe '' in the non-existence of god I think the separation be a valid one To cover my arse what I 'm try to say be that there be an infinitely grey area between weak and strong a well a between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism I wish Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position in effect I be a strong atheist and wish I could be a mathematical one To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence present in favour of any of the god under scrutiny be faulty If I read the FAQ correctly no argument for the existence of god generic a represent by mainstream theologian have ever be found to be unassailable To me this be adequate evidence that the _real_god_ be undefinable or at least no definition have yet be found to be watertight which in turn I accept a sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god I 'm a little fuzzy on the edge though so opinion be welcome but perhaps we should change the thread subject

But there be NO evidence pro or con for the existence or non-existence of God see what I have to say below on this For me it be a conclusion and I have no more faith in it than I have in the premise and the argument use Sorry if I remain skeptical I do n't believe it 's entirely a conclusion That you have see no evidence that there IS a God be correct neither have I But lack of evidence for the existence of something be in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation You personally have never see a neutrino before but they exist The `` pink unicorn '' analogy break down and be rather naive I have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life evolution When I draw the conclusion that '' pink unicorn '' do n't exist because I have n't see them this conclusion have it 's foundation in observation and theory A `` pink unicorn '' if it do exist would be qualitatively similar to other know entity That be to say since there be good evidence that all life on earth have evolve from `` more primitive '' ancestor these pink unicorn would share a common anscestory with horse and zebra and such God however have no such correspondence with anything IMO There be no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusion FROM But first let me say the follow We might have a language problem here in regard to `` faith '' and '' existence '' I a a Christian maintain that God do not exist To exist mean to have be in space and time God do not HAVE be God IS Being Kierkegaard once say that God do not exist He be eternal With this say I feel it 's rather pointless to debate the so call `` existence '' of God and that be not what I 'm do here I believe that God be the source and ground of be When you say that `` god do not exist '' I also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different thing by it However in what follow I will use the phrase `` the existence of God '' in it's 'usual sense and this be the sense that I think you be use it I would like a clarification upon what you mean by `` the existence of God '' No that 's a word game I disagree with you profoundly on this I have n't define God a existence in fact I have n't define God But this might be get off the subject although if you think it 's relevant we can come back to it Further say god be existence be either a waste of time existence be already use and there be no need to replace it by god or you be imply more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far be incomplete make it a fallacy You be use wrong category here or perhaps you misunderstand what I 'm say I 'm make no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there be no fallacy I 'm not try to convince you of anything *I* Believe and that rest upon Faith And it be inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tell you that they can logically prove God or that they have `` evidence '' or ... then the use of logic to disprove their claim if fine and necessary BTW an incomplete argument be not a fallacy some thing be not EVEN wrong Deletion One can never prove that God do or do not exist When you say that you believe God do not exist and that this be an opinion '' base upon observation '' I will have to ask `` what observtions be you refer to '' There be NO observation pro or con that be valid here in establish a POSITIVE belief Deletion Where do that follow Are n't observation base on the assumption that something exists I do n't follow you here Certainly one can make observation of thing that they do n't know exist I still maintain that one can not use observation to infer that `` God do not exist '' Such a positive assertion require a leap And would n't you say there be a level of definition that the assumption `` god be '' be meaningful If not I would reject that concept anyway So where be your evidence for that `` god be '' be meaningful at some level Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me I have no EVIDENCE that `` 'god be be meaningful '' at ANY level Maybe such a response a you give just come naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat I however be not do this I be argue one and only one thing that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against require a leap it require faith I be a you would say a '' theist '' however there be a form of atheism that I can respect but it must be found upon honesty Benedikt

In 114127 bu.edu jaeger buphy.bu.edu writes deletia I do n't understand the point of this petty sarcasm It be a basic principle of Islam that if one be born muslim or one say `` I testify that there be no god but God and Mohammad be a prophet of God '' that so long a one do not explicitly reject Islam by word then one _must_ be consider muslim by all muslim So the phenomenon you 're attempt to make into a general rule or psychology be a direct odds with basic Islamic principle If you want to attack Islam you could do well than than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts In the deletion somewhere it mention something about chop off of hand be a punishment for theft in Saudi Arabia Assuming this be so I would n't know and assume it be do by people fitting your requirement for `` muslim '' which I find highly likely then would you please try to convince Bobby Mozumder that muslim chop people 's hand off Come back when you 've succeed
mangoe cs.umd.edu Charley Wingate writes Nanci Ann Miller writes My favorite reply to the `` you be be too literal-minded '' complaint be that if the bible be really inspire by God and if it be really THAT important to him then he would make damn certain all the translator and scribe and people interpret and copying it be get it right literally If not then why should I put ANY merit at all in something that have be corrupt over and over and over by man even if it be originally inspire by God The `` corrupt over and over '' theory be pretty weak Comparison of the current hebrew text with old version and translation show that the text have in fact change very little over a space of some two millennium This should n't be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner be likely to make some pain to make good copy -- Do you honestly hold to that tripe Charley For a start there be enough current version of the Bible to make comparison to show that what you write above be utter garbage Witness JW Mormon Catholic Anglican and Greek Orthodox Bibles But to really convince you I 'd have to take you to a good old library In our local library we have a 1804 King James which I compare to a brand new hot of God 's tongue Good News Bible Genesis be almost unrecognisable many of the discrepencies between the four gospel have be edit from the Good News Bible In fact the God of Good News be a much more congenial fellow I must say If you like I 'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quote At least the heading have n't change much

In article 1993Apr14.131032.15644 monu6.cc.monash.edu.au darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au Fred Rice write It be my understand that it be generally agree upon by the ulema Islamic scholar that Islamic law applies only in an Islamic country of which the UK be not Furthermore to take the law into one 's own hand be a criminal act a these be matter for the state not for individual Nevertheless Khomeini offer a cash prize for people to take the law into their own hand -- something which to my understand be against Islamic law Yes this be also my understand of the majority of Islamic law However I believe there be also certain legal ruling which in all five school of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari can be level against muslim or non-muslims both within and outside dar-al-islam I do not know if apostasy when accompany by active persistent and open hostility to Islam fall into this category of the law I do know that historically apostasy have very rarely be punish at all let alone by the death penalty My understand be that Khomeini 's ruling be not base on the law of apostasy alone It be well know that Rushdie be an apostate long before he write the offend novel and certainly there be no precedent in the Qur'an hadith or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly level death penalty for apostasy I believe the charge level against Rushdie be that of `` fasad '' This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carry out by individual The reward be not offer by Khomeini but by individual within Iran Stuff delete Also I think you be muddy the issue a you seem to assume that Khomeini 's fatwa be issue due to the _distribution_ of the book My understand be that Khomeini 's fatwa be issue in response to the _writing_ and _publishing_ of the book If my view be correct then your viewpoint that Rushdie be sentence for a `` crime in progress '' be incorrect I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what I remember be level at the author and all those who assist in the publication of the book However the charge of `` fasad '' can encompass a number of lesser charge I remember that when diplomatic relation broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa Iran stress that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation be two preliminary condition for resolve the '' crisis '' But you be correct to point out that ban the book be not the main thrust behind the fatwa Islamic charge such a fasad be level at people not book The Rushdie situation be follow in Iran for several month before the issuance of the fatwa Rushdie go on a medium blitz present himself a a lone knight guard the sacred value of secular democracy and mock the foolish concern of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious belief a sacred Fanning the flame and milk the controversy to boost his image and push the book he be everywhere in the medium Then Muslim demonstrator in several country be kill while protest against the book Rushdie appear momentarily concerned then climbed back on his medium horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred right It be at this point that the fatwa on `` fasad '' be issue The fatwa be level at the person of Rushdie any action of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of it own but by the will of the author and the publisher The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his action a well The crime be certainly a crime in progress at many level and be be played out and played up in the the full view of the medium

Jon Livesey writes So why do I read in the paper that the Qumram text have `` different version '' of some OT text Did I misunderstand Reading newspaper to learn about this kind of stuff be not the best idea in the world Newspaper reporter be notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion and be prone to exaggeration in the interest of have a `` real '' story that be a big headline Let 's back up to 1935 At this point we have the Masoretic text the various targums translations/commentaries in aramaic etc and the Septuagint the ancient greek translation The Masoretic text be the standard Jewish text and essentially do not vary In some place it have obvious corruption all of which be copy faithfully from copy to copy These passage in the past be interpret by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint Now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particular first it include additional text and second in some passage there be variant reading from the masoretic text in addition to `` fix '' /predating the various corrupt passage It must be emphasize that to the best of my knowledge these variation be only signifcant to bible scholar and have little theological import The dead sea scroll material add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragment of various size of almost all other OT book There be also an abundance of other material but a far a I know there be no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha the extra text in the septuagint As far a analysis have proceed there be also variation between the DSS text and the masoretic version These tend to reflect the septuagint where the latter be n't obviously in error Again though the difference thus far be not significant theologically There be this big expectation that there be great theological surprise lurk in the material but so far this have n't happen The DSS *are* important because there be almost no textual tradition in the OT unlike for the NT

Benedikt Rosenau writes And what about that revelation thing Charley If you 're talk about this intellectual engagement of revelation well it 's obviously a risk one take Many people say that the concept of metaphysical and religious knowledge be contradictive I 'm not an objectivist so I 'm not particularly impressed with problem of conceptualization The problem in this case be at least a bad a that of try to explain quantum mechanic and relativity in the term of ordinary experience One can get some rough understand but the language be from the perspective of ordinary phenomenon inconsistent and from the perspective of what 's be described rather inexact to be charitable An analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem be that the `` well '' descriptive language be not available And in case it hold reliable information can you show how you establish that This word `` reliable '' be essentially meaningless in the context -- unless you can show how reliability can be determine

Archive-name atheism/introduction Alt-atheism-archive-name introduction Last-modified 5 April 1993 Version 1.2 -- -- -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE -- -- An Introduction to Atheism by mathew mathew mantis.co.uk This article attempt to provide a general introduction to atheism Whilst I have try to be a neutral a possible regard contentious issue you should always remember that this document represent only one viewpoint I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusion some relevant book be list in a companion article To provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have present this article a an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist All the question ask by the imaginary theist be question which have be cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup be create Some other frequently ask question be answer in a companion article Please note that this article be arguably slant towards answer question pose from a Christian viewpoint This be because the FAQ file reflect question which have actually be ask and it be predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism So when I talk of religion I be talk primarily about religion such a Christianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine be Much of the discussion will apply to other religion but some of it may not `` What be atheism '' Atheism be characterize by an absence of belief in the existence of God Some atheist go far and believe that God do not exist The former be often refer to a the `` weak atheist '' position and the latter a `` strong atheism '' It be important to note the difference between these two position `` Weak atheism '' be simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of God `` Strong atheism '' be a positive belief that God do not exist Please do not fall into the trap of assume that all atheist be `` strong atheist '' Some atheist believe in the non-existence of all Gods others limit their atheism to specific Gods such a the Christian God rather than make flat-out denial `` But be n't disbelieve in God the same thing a believe he do n't exist '' Definitely not Disbelief in a proposition mean that one do not believe it to be true Not believe that something be true be not equivalent to believe that it be false one may simply have no idea whether it be true or not Which brings u to agnosticism `` What be agnosticism then '' The term 'agnosticism be coin by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 He define an agnostic a someone who disclaim `` strong '' atheism and believe that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable Thus an agnostic be someone who believe that we do not and can not know for sure whether God exists Words be slippery thing and language be inexact Beware of assume that you can work out someone 's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnostic For example many people use agnosticism to mean `` weak atheism '' and use the word `` atheism '' only when refer to `` strong atheism '' Beware also that because the word `` atheist '' have so many shade of meaning it be very difficult to generalize about atheist About all you can say for sure be that atheist do n't believe in God For example it certainly isn't the case that all atheist believe that science be the best way to find out about the universe `` So what be the philosophical justification or basis for atheism '' There be many philosophical justification for atheism To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist it 's best to ask her Many atheist feel that the idea of God a present by the major religion be essentially self-contradictory and that it be logically impossible that such a God could exist Others be atheist through scepticism because they see no evidence that God exists `` But be n't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something '' There be many counter-examples to such a statement For example it be quite simple to prove that there do not exist a prime number large than all other prime number Of course this deal with well-defined object obey well-defined rule Whether Gods or universe be similarly well-defined be a matter for debate However assume for the moment that the existence of a God be not provably impossible there be still subtle reason for assume the non-existence of God If we assume that something do not exist it be always possible to show that this assumption be invalid by find a single counter-example If on the other hand we assume that something do exist and if the thing in question be not provably impossible show that the assumption be invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a thing might be found to show that it be n't there Such an exhaustive search be often impractical or impossible There be no such problem with large prime because we can prove that they do n't exist Therefore it be generally accepted that we must assume thing do not exist unless we have evidence that they do Even theist follow this rule most of the time they do n't believe in unicorn even though they ca n't conclusively prove that no unicorn exist anywhere To assume that God exists be to make an assumption which probably can not be test We can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he do n't exist anywhere So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God do not exist since that be an assumption we can test Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists instead they generally restrict their claim so a to cover variety of God described by follower of various religion So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists it may be possible to prove that say a God a described by a particular religious book do not exist It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists In practice believe that no God described by any religion exists be very close to believe that no God exists However it be sufficiently different that counter-arguments base on the impossibility of disprove every kind of God be not really applicable `` But what if God be essentially non-detectable '' If God interacts with our universe in any way the effect of his interaction must be measurable Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable If God be essentially non-detectable it must therefore be the case that he do not interact with our universe in any way Many atheist would argue that if God do not interact with our universe at all it be of no importance whether he exists or not If the Bible be to be believe God be easily detectable by the Israelites Surely he should still be detectable today Note that I be not demand that God interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way It must surely be possible to perceive some effect cause by his presence though otherwise how can I distinguish him from all the other thing that do n't exist `` OK you may think there 's a philosophical justification for atheism but be n't it still a religious belief '' One of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion be `` the redefinition game '' The cynical view of this game be a follow Person A begin by make a contentious statement When person B point out that it ca n't be true person A gradually re-defines the word he use in the statement until he arrives at something person B be prepared to accept He then record the statement along with the fact that person B have agree to it and continue Eventually A us the statement a an `` agree fact '' but us his original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally need to get B to agree to it Rather than be see to be apparently inconsistent B will tend to play along The point of this digression be that the answer to the question `` Isn't atheism a religious belief '' depends crucially upon what be meant by '' religious '' `` Religion '' be generally characterize by belief in a superhuman control power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship It 's worth point out in passing that some variety of Buddhism be not `` religion '' accord to such a definition Atheism be certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor be it categorize by worship in any meaningful sense Widening the definition of '' religious '' to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspect of human behaviour suddenly become class a `` religious '' a well -- such a science politics and watch TV `` OK so it 's not a religion But surely belief in atheism or science be still just an act of faith like religion be '' Firstly it 's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism be something one actually believe in Secondly it be necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience Most atheist try to adopt a few core belief a possible and even those be subject to question if experience throw them into doubt Science have a number of core assumption For example it be generally assume that the law of physic be the same for all observer These be the sort of core assumption atheist make If such basic idea be call '' act of faith '' then almost everything we know must be say to be base on act of faith and the term loses it meaning Faith be more often use to refer to complete certain belief in something According to such a definition atheism and science be certainly not act of faith Of course individual atheist or scientist can be a dogmatic a religious follower when claim that something be `` certain '' This be not a general tendency however there be many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists Faith be also use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof Sceptical atheism certainly do n't fit that definition a sceptical atheism have no belief Strong atheism be closer but still do n't really match a even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when assert that God do not exist `` If atheism be not religious surely it 's anti-religious '' It be an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone a either `` for '' or '' against '' `` friend '' or `` enemy '' The truth be not so clear-cut Atheism be the position that run logically counter to theism in that sense it can be say to be `` anti-religion '' However when religious believer speak of atheist be `` anti-religious '' they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theist This categorization of atheist a hostile towards religion be quite unfair Atheist attitude towards theist in fact cover a broad spectrum Most atheist take a `` live and let live '' attitude Unless question they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friend Of course this may be in part because atheism be not `` socially acceptable '' in many country A few atheist be quite anti-religious and may even try to `` convert '' others when possible Historically such anti-religious atheist have make little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc country To digress slightly the Soviet Union be originally dedicate to separation of church and state just like the USA Soviet citizen be legally free to worship a they wish The institution of `` state atheism '' come about when Stalin take control of the Soviet Union and try to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the population Some atheist be quite vocal about their belief but only where they see religion encroach on matter which be not it business -- for example the government of the USA Such individual be usually concerned that church and state should remain separate `` But if you do n't allow religion to have a say in the run of the state surely that 's the same a state atheism '' The principle of the separation of church and state be that the state shall not legislate concern matter of religious belief In particular it mean not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it can not promote any belief which be religious in nature Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matter For example religious believer have historically be responsible for encourage many political reform Even today many organization campaign for an increase in spending on foreign aid be found a religious campaign So long a they campaign concern secular matter and so long a they do not discriminate on religious ground most atheist be quite happy to see them have their say `` What about prayer in school If there 's no God why do you care if people pray '' Because people who do pray be voter and lawmaker and tend to do thing that those who do n't pray ca n't just ignore Also Christian prayer in school be intimidate to non-Christians even if they be told that they need not join in The diversity of religious and non-religious belief mean that it be impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event Also non-prayers tend to have friend and family who pray It be reasonable to care about friend and family waste their time even without other motif `` You mention Christians who campaign for increase foreign aid What about atheist Why be n't there any atheist charity or hospital Don't atheist object to the religious charity '' There be many charity without religious purpose that atheist can contribute to Some atheist contribute to religious charity a well for the sake of the practical good they do Some atheist even do voluntary work for charity found on a theistic basis Most atheist seem to feel that atheism be n't worth shout about in connection with charity To them atheism be just a simple obvious everyday matter and so be charity Many feel that it 's somewhat cheap not to say self-righteous to use simple charity a an excuse to plug a particular set of religious belief To `` weak '' atheist building a hospital to say `` I do not believe in God '' be a rather strange idea it 's rather like hold a party to say `` Today be not my birthday '' Why the fuss Atheism be rarely evangelical `` You say atheism be n't anti-religious But be it perhaps a backlash against one 's upbringing a way of rebel '' Perhaps it be for some But many people have parent who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist idea upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheist It 's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion a a backlash against an atheist upbringing a a way of be different On the other hand many people choose religion a a way of conform to the expectation of others On the whole we ca n't conclude much about whether atheism or religion be backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently `` How do atheist differ from religious people '' They do n't believe in God That 's all there be to it Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem even if they know the word They may wear Hawaiian shirt they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robe Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God Some atheist even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for argue against of course Whoever you be the chance be you have met several atheist without realise it Atheists be usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance `` Unexceptional But be n't atheist less moral than religious people '' That depends If you define morality a obedience to God then of course atheist be less moral a they do n't obey any God But usually when one talk of morality one talk of what be acceptable `` right '' and unacceptable `` wrong '' behaviour within society Humans be social animal and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other This be a good enough reason to discourage most atheist from `` anti-social '' or `` immoral '' behaviour purely for the purpose of self-preservation Many atheist behave in a `` moral '' or `` compassionate '' way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other human So why do they care what happens to others They do n't know they simply be that way Naturally there be some people who behave `` immorally '' and try to use atheism to justify their action However there be equally many people who behave `` immorally '' and then try to use religious belief to justify their action For example `` Here be a trustworthy say that deserves full acceptance Jesus Christ come into the world to save sinner ... But for that very reason I be show mercy so that in me ... Jesus Christ might display His unlimited patience a an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life Now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only God be honor and glory forever and ever '' The above quote be from a statement make to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee Wisconsin It seem that for every atheist mass-murderer there be a religious mass-murderer But what of more trivial morality A survey conduct by the Roper Organization found that behavior deteriorate after `` born again '' experience While only 4 of respondent say they have driven intoxicate before be `` born again '' 12 have do so after conversion Similarly 5 have use illegal drug before conversion 9 after Two percent admit to engage in illicit sex before salvation 5 after `` Freethought Today '' September 1991 p 12 So it seem that at best religion do not have a monopoly on moral behaviour `` Is there such a thing a atheist morality '' If you mean `` Is there such a thing a morality for atheist `` then the answer be yes a explain above Many atheist have idea about morality which be at least a strong a those held by religious people If you mean `` Does atheism have a characteristic moral code `` then the answer be no Atheism by itself do not imply anything much about how a person will behave Most atheist follow many of the same `` moral rule '' a theist but for different reason Atheists view morality a something create by human accord to the way human feel the world 'ought to work rather than see it a a set of rule decreed by a supernatural be `` Then be n't atheist just theist who be deny God '' A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90 of the atheist who respond become atheist because religion do not work for them They have found that religious belief be fundamentally incompatible with what they observe around them Atheists be not unbeliever through ignorance or denial they be unbeliever through choice The vast majority of them have spent time study one or more religion sometimes in very great depth They have make a careful and consider decision to reject religious belief This decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual 's personality For a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism be often the only one that make sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make `` But do n't atheist want to believe in God '' Atheists live their life a though there be nobody watch over them Many of them have no desire to be watch over no matter how good-natured the '' Big Brother '' figure might be Some atheist would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what Should one believe thing merely because one want them to be true The risk of such an approach should be obvious Atheists often decide that want to believe something be not enough there must be evidence for the belief `` But of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of God -- they be unwilling in their soul to see '' Many if not most atheist be previously religious As have be explain above the vast majority have seriously consider the possibility that God exists Many atheist have spent time in prayer try to reach God Of course it be true that some atheist lack an open mind but assume that all atheist be bias and insincere be offensive and closed-minded Comments such a `` Of course God be there you just be n't look properly '' be likely to be view a patronize Certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it be vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they be be sincere if they say that they have search for God If you be not willing to believe that they be basically tell the truth debate be futile `` Is n't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist '' Many atheist live a purposeful life They decide what they think give meaning to life and they pursue those goal They try to make their life count not by wish for eternal life but by have an influence on other people who will live on For example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leave his mark on history It be a natural human tendency to look for `` meaning '' or `` purpose '' in random event However it be by no mean obvious that `` life '' be the sort of thing that have a `` meaning '' To put it another way not everything which look like a question be actually a sensible thing to ask Some atheist believe that ask `` What be the meaning of life '' be a silly a ask `` What be the meaning of a cup of coffee '' They believe that life have no purpose or meaning it just be `` So how do atheist find comfort in time of danger '' There be many way of obtain comfort from family friend or even pet Or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or TV That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what Should individual believe in thing because they be comfort or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be In the end it 's a decision for the individual concerned Most atheist be unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make them feel comfortable They put truth before comfort and consider that if search for truth sometimes make them feel unhappy that 's just hard luck `` Do n't atheist worry that they might suddenly be show to be wrong '' The short answer be `` No do you '' Many atheist have be atheist for year They have encounter many argument and much suppose evidence for the existence of God but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive Thousands of year of religious belief have n't result in any good proof of the existence of God Atheists therefore tend to feel that they be unlikely to be prove wrong in the immediate future and they stop worry about it `` So why should theist question their belief Do n't the same argument apply '' No because the belief be question be not similar Weak atheism be the sceptical `` default position '' to take it asserts nothing Strong atheism be a negative belief Theism be a very strong positive belief Atheists sometimes also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believer but to everyone else `` What sort of harm '' Religion represent a huge financial and work burden on mankind It 's not just a matter of religious believer waste their money on church building think of all the time and effort spent building church pray and so on Imagine how that effort could be well spent Many theist believe in miracle heal There have be plenty of instance of ill people be `` heal '' by a priest cease to take the medicine prescribed to them by doctor and die a a result Some theist have die because they have refuse blood transfusion on religious ground It be arguable that the Catholic Church 's opposition to birth control -- and condom in particular -- be increase the problem of overpopulation in many third-world country and contribute to the spread of AIDS world-wide Religious believer have be know to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of a different religion `` Those be n't REAL believer They just claimed to be believer a some sort of excuse '' What make a real believer There be so many One True Religions it 's hard to tell Look at Christianity there be many compete group all convince that they be the only true Christians Sometimes they even fight and kill each other How be an atheist suppose to decide who 's a REAL Christian and who be n't when even the major Christian church like the Catholic Church and the Church of England ca n't decide amongst themselves In the end most atheist take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who call himself a Christian and us Christian belief or dogma to justify his action should be consider a Christian Maybe some of those Christians be just pervert Christian teach for their own end -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily use to support un-Christian act it ca n't be much of a moral code If the Bible be the word of God why could n't he have make it less easy to misinterpret And how do you know that your belief be n't a perversion of what your God intend If there be no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so Sorry but if someone claim that he believe in Jesus and that he murder others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so we must call him a Christian `` Obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question But since nobody have ever prove that God do not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious belief share by all faith be nonsense '' That do not hold because a be point out at the start of this dialogue positive assertion concern the existence of entity be inherently much harder to disprove than negative one Nobody have ever prove that unicorn do n't exist but that do n't make it unlikely that they be myth It be therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it be to hold a positive assertion by default Of course `` weak '' atheist would argue that assert nothing be well still `` Well if atheism 's so great why be there so many theist '' Unfortunately the popularity of a belief have little to do with how `` correct '' it be or whether it `` work '' consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo-sciences Many atheist feel that it be simply a human weakness to want to believe in god Certainly in many primitive human society religion allows the people to deal with phenomenon that they do not adequately understand Of course there 's more to religion than that In the industrialize world we find people believe in religious explanation of phenomenon even when there be perfectly adequate natural explanation Religion may have start a a mean of attempt to explain the world but nowadays it serf other purpose a well `` But so many culture have developed religion Surely that must say something '' Not really Most religion be only superficially similar for example it's worth remember that religion such a Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense Of course most religion be quick to denounce compete religion so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another `` What about all the famous scientist and philosopher who have conclude that God exists '' For every scientist or philosopher who believe in a god there be one who do not Besides a have already be point out the truth of a belief be not determine by how many people believe it Also it be important to realize that atheist do not view famous scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religious leader A famous scientist be only human she may be an expert in some field but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight Many respect scientist have make themselves look foolish by speak on subject which lie outside their field of expertise `` So be you really say that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing '' Not entirely It certainly indicates that the religion in question have property which have help it so spread so far The theory of memetics talk of `` meme '' -- set of idea which can propagate themselves between human mind by analogy with gene Some atheist view religion a set of particularly successful parasitic meme which spread by encourage their host to convert others Some meme avoid destruction by discourage believer from question doctrine or by use peer pressure to keep one-time believer from admit that they be mistaken Some religious meme even encourage their host to destroy host control by other meme Of course in the memetic view there be no particular virtue associate with successful propagation of a meme Religion be not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease be a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it `` Even if religion be not entirely true at least it put across important message What be the fundamental message of atheism '' There be many important idea atheist promote The follow be just a few of them do n't be surprised to see idea which be also present in some religion There be more to moral behaviour than mindlessly follow rule Be especially sceptical of positive claim If you want your life to have some sort of meaning it 's up to you to find it Search for what be true even if it make you uncomfortable Make the most of your life a it 's probably the only one you 'll have It 's no good rely on some external power to change you you must change yourself Just because something 's popular do n't mean it 's good If you must assume something assume something it 's easy to test Do n't believe thing just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly All belief should be open to question Thanks for take the time to read this article mathew -- -- -BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE -- --

Further the question be why be have one to carry the burden of Biblical text when one could simply write other book that convey the message well You might answer that one ca n't becuase some peculiar Biblical information might be lose but that hold true of every other book and the question remains why have the Bible still a special place Ca n't it be replace somehow Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that be include a well Deletion Do you see the danger in do so Especially with the metaphers use in the Bible I think the danger of do so be less than either the danger of have a frozen system of law or have no law Sorry but there be bad system do not say anything about if one could not have a well system Deletion If we read two story about the importance of help the poor and in one God be a spirit and in the other God have a body which be more important help the poor or resolve the contradiction about the corporeal nature of God If we read two story in the Bible one that god command people to kill child for be idolater and another where god kill child directly what be more important to resolve the message that child be to be kill or if it have to be do by god And the argument you have give be a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have give to find out if god be corporeal or not it can be crucial in other question Religious believer resolve contradiction with that they choose one of the possibility give in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of be able to attribute their decision to some god

The recent rise of nostalgia in this group combine with the incredible level of utter bullshit have prompt me to comb through my archive and pull out some of `` The Best of Alt.Atheism '' for your reading pleasure I 'll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demand that I stop or I run out of good material I have n't be particularly careful in the past about save attribution I think the follow come from John A. Johnson but someone correct me if I 'm wrong This be probably the long of my entire collection ________________________________________________________ So that the Prophecy be Fulfilled In consider the Christian religion and judging it accord to it claim it be important to look at it claim at fulfil earlier Jewish prophecy The scribe Matthew be perhaps the most eager to draw out what he think be prophetic answer in the career of Jesus of Nazareth As you will see Matthew 's main strategy be to take various Old Testament passage often not even about the promise Messiah and apply them to the circumstance in the New Testament We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the account Since the gospel be write at least 35 year after Jesus be execute we do not know how much happen exactly a state But for purpose of analysis we will take particular claim at face value Immanuel We begin of course at the begin Mt 1.21-22 `` Mary will bear a son and you Joseph will name him 'Jesus which mean G 'd be salvation for he will save his people from their sin '' All this happen to fulfil what the lord have spoken by a prophet Isaiah 7.1-16 In the day of Ahaz c. 750 BCE king of Judah Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel make war on Jerusalem capitol of Judah but could not quite conquer it When the house of David i.e Ahaz and his court in Judah be told of this ... it heart and the heart of it people shook ... And the lord G 'd say to Isaiah `` go to meet with Ahaz ... '' ... And the lord spoke to Ahaz through prophet Isaiah naturally say `` Ask a sign of G 'd your lord It can be a deep a Sheol or a high a heaven '' But Ahaz say `` I wo n't ask I will not put the lord to a test '' Then Isaiah say `` Hear then O house of David Is it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too Therefore the lord himself will give you a sign Behold a young woman be with child and will bear a son and name him `` Immanuel '' which mean `` G 'd be with u '' He will eat curd and honey when he know how to refuse evil and choose good For before the child know how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two king you dread will have be desert ... Matthew home in on just the sentence that be in italic Further he the Hebrew word `` almah '' young woman a specifically `` virgin '' But this be not a prophecy about the Messiah It be not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 year later It be not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother In short it not about Jesus Matthew have make use of a verse out of context and try to make it fit the specific case of Mary It should be note that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be make to fit Mary Mary virgin or not be indeed a young woman with child Of course the fit be shady and have problem Jesus while thought of by later Christians to be G 'd walk among men be never call by the name Immanuel If Christianity wish to claim this prophecy for Jesus it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy ... a second class prophecy Not too convincing Egypt After Jesus 's birth in Bethlehem Matthew tell about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to Egypt a if he wish to liken Jesus to Moses This be do to escape an allege infanticidal rampage of the king Herod Mt 2.15 ... and remain there until the death of Herod This be to fulfil what the lord have spoken `` Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son '' What the lord really say be this Hosea 11.1 When Israel be a child I love him And out of Egypt I call my son The more I call them my people the more they go from me they kept sacrifice to the Ba'als and kept burning incense to idol Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea 's oracle But it be indeed Israel that once call out of Egypt want to return This be history Jesus be certainly not be spoken of here And if we be to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G 'd Again this prophecy be just not a convincing a Matthew probably have hop Rachel Weeps While Jesus be off vacation in Egypt Matthew say that King Herod sought to kill him and thus order the execution of all young male child Matthew then writes Mt 2.17-18 By this that which be spoken by the prophet Jeremiah be fulfil `` A voice be heard in Ramah wail and loud lamentation -- Rachel weep for her child she refuse to be console because they be no more '' The reference be to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15 refer to the carry off of Israel into exile by Sargon of Assyria in 722 BCE Rachel the ancestor of the major tribe of Israel Ephraim and Manasseh be say to weep for her descendant who be `` no more '' It be metaphorical of course since Rachel live and dy before the Hebrews be even in the Egyptian exile It be interest to note that it be Leah not Rachel who be the ancestor of the Judeans the land where Jesus and Bethlehem be If anyone should do weep for her `` child '' it be Leah The only connexion that Rachel have with Bethlehem be that the legend have it that she be bury north of the city '' on the way to Ephrath Bethlehem '' As for Herod and his infanticide it be rather unlikely that such an event actually occur One never know but the event be not mention or allude to anywhere else in the Bible nor be it mention in any of the secular record of the time Herod be particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deed of Herod be carefully record This might be a prime example of how event be add to Jesus 's life to enhance the message of the church 's gospel Because of the whole story 's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt it be highly likely that it be a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of Jesus It be not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglect to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote The `` child '' the prophet speaks of be not dead but exile in the Assyrian Empire G'd comfort the weep Rachel say that the child will be return -- he will gather them back together Of course this would not suit Matthew 's purpose a the child he speaks of be dead for good Again the `` prophecy '' Matthew set up be not even that and to anyone who bother to check it out be not too convincing The Nazarene We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy After leave Egypt Joseph wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth Mt 2.23 ... that what be spoken of by the prophet might be fulfil `` He shall be call a Nazarene '' First thing we notice be that Matthew do not mention the name of the prophet s this time Second we have to ask who `` He '' be There be no Messianic prophecy speak of a Nazarene Worse there be no prophecy period mention a Nazarene Still bad there be no Nazarenes mention in the Old Testament at all In the book of Judges an angel tell Samson 's mother that she will Judges 13.5 `` ... conceive and bear a son No razor shall tough his head for he will be a Nazirite to his god from the day of his birth He will deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines '' This be of course not a prophecy of Jesus or the messiah of G 'd But it be the best that can be found Obviously Matthew have begin to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecy in that he be simple make them up now Bearing our Diseases Jesus next go around heal people of physical illness and disability Mt 8.17 This be to fulfil what be spoken by the prophet Isaiah `` He take our infirmity and bore our disease '' As expect the verse quote in Isaiah be quote out of context and a few word be skewed to fit the Christian scheme We have Is 53.4 Surely he the suffer servant have borne our sickness and carry our pain From a reading of the surround passage in Isaiah we know that the prophet be speak in present tense of the collective nation of Israel Jehovah 's chosen servant and people He speaks to the Israelites suffer in exile in the voice of the gentile nation that look upon it This image be deeply ingrain in Jewish identity -- an image of a chastise yet cherished Israel a the instrument of the nation salvation by G 'd The verse speak of Israel take on the sickness which be the literal and metaphorical manifestation of guilt and discipline They do not speak of a `` servant '' go around and heal people Notice that the servant in Isaiah take on the sickness and pain of the nation and individual Jews Jesus a we all know do not take the disease onto himself The verse here in Isaiah be not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that have already happen While it be believe that Jesus take on the eternal punishment of hell he do not bear the illness he heal So while someone might want to say that figuratively Jesus reenact the deed of Israel in his spiritual atonement he have to admit that Matthew 's parallel miss where he intend it to have it effect Silent Messiah Upon heal multitude of commoner it be say that Jesus order them to keep quiet presumable so that he would n't arouse the attention of the local ruler Mt 12.15-21 This be to fulfill what be spoken by the prophet Isaiah `` Behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved with whom my soul be pleased I will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the Gentiles He will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the street He will not break a bruise reed or quench a smolder wick until he brings justice to victory and the gentile will hope in his name '' The Isaiah passage quote read Is 42.1-4 Behold my servant whom I uphold my chosen in whom my soul delight I have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the nation We will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the street He will not break a bruise reed or quench a smolder wick He will faithfully bring forth justice He will not fail burn dimly or be discourage bruise until he have establish justice in the earth And the coastland await his law You see Matthew have conveniently left out part of the passage because it do not suit the dealing of Jesus Christians could never think of Jesus fail never would the `` light '' of mankind burn dimly But the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when it job be do When the gentile come to embrace G 'd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the child of G 'd Also the end phrase have be change from the Judaic `` ... the coastland await his law '' to the Christologic `` the Gentiles will hope in his name '' While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah the other rewrite it to fit it strange doctrine of `` believe in the name '' If one have any doubt the servant refer to be not Jesus one have only to read the whole chapter Isaiah 42 and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant `` a people robbed and plunder ... '' So we see that when Matthew 's attempt at '' prophecy '' be examine it crumbles Three Days and Three Nights Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection Mt 12.40 For a Jonah be in the belly of the whale for three day and three night so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three day and three night Before any far discussion can occur it be necessary to know how the Jews understood day As far a day name go each be 24 hour long last from sunset 6pm to the follow sunset 6pm What be refer to a a `` day '' be the period of light from 6am to the end sunset at 6pm Thus accord to our time scale a sabbath day begin at 6pm Friday even and last until 6pm saturday even This be why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays instead of Sundays It seem like a real miracle that Christians do n't forget that Saturday be indeed the seventh and last day of the week Thus when day and night be refer to together 12 hour daylight portion and 12 hour night period be be spoken of Thus Jesus say that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three day and three night As the good book tell u Jesus be crucify on the `` ninth hour '' which be 3pm Friday afternoon He then be put into the grave sometime after that Then Jesus left the grave `` rise '' before dawn of what we call Sunday The dawn after the sabbath be over What this mean be that Jesus be use our time for clarity in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday since the bible be not specific here What this mean use Jewish time be that he be in the grave for one day two night and possibly a couple of hour of one day Certainly this be a problem for Jesus prediction There be absolutely no way we be even able to have his death involve three day and three night -- even use modern time measurement We then be lead to suspect that this error be another one of Matthew 's little mistake and that the gospel writer put false word into his god 's mouth And no matter who make the prediction it be more than unconvincing ... it be counter-convincing Hearing Understanding Jesus tool on a habit of speak to his vast audience in parable -- story in which a deeper meaning could be found if you be already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of Jesus He reason that those who can understand the parable be the one he want If the people can not understand them there be no need to bother with them since they will not accept the `` plain '' message any well Matthew say Mt 13.14-16 With them the audience indeed in fulfil the prophecy of Isaiah which say `` You will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive Because this people 's heart have grown dull their ear be heavy of hearing and they have shut their eye so the they would not perceive with them her with their ear and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them '' The original Isaiah passage be part of his earlier work his call to the ministry This be in 740 BCE when Israel be flourish right before it fall under the authority of Assyria Isaiah see the good time end and also a vision from G 'd call him to bring reform to Israel and Judah Is 6.9-13 And G 'd say `` Go and say to this people Hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive Make the heart of this people fat make their ear heavy and shut their eye so they will not see with their eye or hear with their ear and understand with their heart and turn and be heal '' Then Isaiah say `` How long lord '' And he say `` Until the city lie waste without inhabitant and house without men and the land be utterly desolate and the G'ds take men far away and forsaken place be many in the land And though a tenth will remain in it it will be burn again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stand when the tree be fell '' The holy seed be it stump Here we see that it be really G 'd who cause the people of Israel to stop listen to the prophet 's warning but reaffirms the promise make to Solomon 's and David 's seed/lineage If you read the rest of Isaiah you find that this be do to fulfil the plan of G 'd to use Israel a a servant a light to the nation Look at Isaiah 42.18-25 48.20 49.3 We see that Matthew have cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah 's verse to suit his own gospel need More than that he have alter the word to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus 's story And a we see Isaiah 's verse be not prophecy but rather command from G 'd to him in the present Once again Matthew 's prophecy fall flat on it face Matthew try again to make Jesus 's parable look like they have the prophetic approval Mt 13.35 ... he say nothing to them without a parable This be to fulfil what be spoken of by the prophet `` I will open my mouth to them in parable I will utter that which have be hidden since the foundation of the world '' Matthew really botch up here He attempt to quote not from a prophet but from the Psalms Ps 78.2-4 I will open my mouth in parable I will utter dark saying of old thing that we all have heard and know thing that our father have told u We will not hide them from their child but tell to the come generation the glorious deed of the lord ... As be point out the verse in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet You might also want to know that earlier copy of Matthew 's gospel even insert Isaiah 's name a this prophet Apparently later scribe caught the error and try to cover some of it up Perhaps the most significant part of this be that once again Matthew have alter the Old Testament Scriptures As Jesus have say earlier he speaks in parable so that some will not understand them The parable in the Psalms be not to be hidden Further they speak of thing `` know that our father have told u '' Jesus deal with thing `` hidden since the foundation of the world '' Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion This be in direct opposition to the parable in the Psalms No wonder Matthew have to rewrite them And still once again Matthew 's artificial prophecy fall flat on their face But Christians rarely look at this Matthew 's prophecy be n't the only thing about Christianity that be begin to look bad Excuses of Little Faith In Mt 17.14-21 we see that the disciple be able to go around cast out demon except in one case Not know what epilepsy be the people thought those with the disease be possesed with demon It be no wonder that the disciple be unable to `` dispossess '' the epileptic But Jesus perhaps no more enlighten than they be report to have rebuke them say they do n't have enough faith This seem strange Why be this demon special It seem that either a true believer have faith or he do not Apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountain Of course you will find no one these day that can move real mountain No one part sea The only miracle the Charismatics can speak of be those rumour to happen on trip to Mexico or some faraway place Major miracle be make some old woman 's arthritis feel well on Sunday morning T.V And the god include Jesus be always shroud in ancient lore and writing protect from the skeptic in their sacred past They be either dead sleep or hiding in heaven with people rumour about their imminent return and their great miracle of day long go Yet life go on Tales of mystic story of miracle -- all in a distant time or a distant place Gods use to reveal themselves to men in the old day Jehovah too But now they be silent All the theologian give be various excuse a to why we do n't get to see God anymore We 're too lazy we 're not zealous enough we're sinful it 's just his `` plan '' we put too many of our own demand on G'd 's appearance if we have the right faith if we be willing to meet G 'd on his term ... Yet even the most pious of men have not see G 'd You dear reader have not see G 'd Not literally you know that to be true I know that 's presumptuous and bold But search your heart you know what I mean All that we 've see religion do be make people feel good and content about not see G 'd They say our little faith do not merit u to see G 'd Sometimes they say `` See the love in these people you worship with ... see the life of people change ... that be see G 'd '' Thus people get lull to sleep satisfied with turn G 'd into the everyday sight But that be not see G 'd a I be speak of ... it be not see G 'd the way people use to see What we see in the world that be good be the compassion of human heart the love give and take by men and woman the forgiveness practise by Christian Atheist alike beauty create by the mind of man These be the thing that be do these be what we see But it be say this be so only because everybody have little faith Jesus Rides on an Ass Shortly after accept the role of the Jewish messiah king Jesus request a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem Mt 21.5 This take place to fulfil what be spoken by the prophet say Tell the daughter of Zion `` Behold your king be come to you humble mount on an as and on a ass-colt '' Of course the passage quote from Zechariah 9.9 read a little differently Lo your king come to you he be triumphant and victorious humble and rid on an as on an ass- colt ... he will command peace to the nation There be n't all that much difference here except that Zechariah only involves one animal -- an ass-colt -- while Matthew read the poetic word slightly differently Thus he have Jesus call for both a colt and an adult as From Matthew 's version we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweat it to straddle two donkey This could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma We find that in the account write earlier by St. Mark only the colt be call for and brought to Jesus This indeed fit the verse of Zechariah properly and show u that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verse he have bungle Now exclude many respectable Christians I have met I have notice that while Christ be thought to have ridden on ass the situation be often reverse nowadays ... Then enter the Jerusalem temple the priest be angered at people and youngster call Jesus the messiah But Jesus reply a we might expect Matthew to have do Mt 21.16 Have n't you read Out of the mouth of babe and suckling thou have brought perfect praise It be more likely that Matthew make this response up since Jesus be never one to point out such little `` prophetic '' thing AND since a we might expect the quote be in error which seem to fit Matthew 's track record quite well We might ask Jesus or Matthew `` Have n't you read '' for the source read Psalms 8.1-2 O YaHWeH our lord how majestic be your name in the whole world You whose glory be chant above the heaven by babe and infant you have found a bulwark against your foe to still the enemy and the avenger The passage hardly need comment There be no `` perfect praise '' spoken of in the psalm and what praise be there be give to G 'd not his messiah king and not Jesus As mention it seem to be just one more case of Matthew 's pen make up convenient prophetic scripture YHVH say to my lord ... Jesus be say to have ask from whom the promise Jewish messiah-king be to be descend The Jews agree -- it be king David But then Jesus counter by quote Psalms 110 `` The LORD say to my Lord sit at my right hand until I put your enemy under your foot '' Taken at face value Jesus be deny the necessity of Davidic descent One assumes he be in opposition to their answer Of course the Christian answer be that he agrees but be try to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king It 's tempt to believe this if one be a Christian and not interested in matter of investigation But there be problem In Jesus 's time the psalm be thought to be about the messiah And it be easy to see why David might refer to the messiah a his superior We need only look at the scripture about the messiah to see that he be expect to be a great king bring the Jews to time even well than those under David's rule Of course the Jews listen have no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such a the Christians worship The problem lie in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus 's time have also make One must remember that there be various faction among the Jews often a a result of different expectation of the messiah-king Jesus be apparently one of these adventist like his audience who thought the messiah 's advent be imminent and who interpret Psalms 110 among others a be messianic What be the problem then Psalm 110 literally read YHVH 's utterance to my lord '' Sit at my right hand until I make your enemy your footstool '' YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion Rule in the midst of your foe Your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountain `` You be a priest of the order of Melchizedek forever '' The word `` lord '' be often mistakenly capitalise by Christian bible to denote divinity in this lord But in the Hebrew the word be `` adoni '' and no capitalisation exists Adoni simply mean '' lord '' a generic term a we would use it It be use often in the scripture to refer to king and to G 'd It be merely an address of respect There be nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king That this be suppose to be write by David be not certain The title of the psalm translates to either `` a psalm of David '' or `` a psalm about David '' It seem fitting to assume it to be write by a court poet about David 's covenant and endorsement from G 'd If the psalm have be write by David it be unlikely that he would be talk about the messiah The idea of a perfect king descend from David be not present in David 's age We have extensive tale of David 's doings and saying -- none of which include any praise of a messiah Many of the psalm show evidence of be write long after David be dead in time of the exile when G 'd have put his show of favour for David 's kingdom on hold The description in the psalm fit David very well David be promise by G 'd a rise to power victory over his enemy successful judgement among the nation he conquer He achieve the priesthood common to Melchizedek in be a righteous king enable to bless the people It all fit We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone though Here there be not artificial prophecy allude to though his use of the scripture be rather questionable Still this event be common to the other gospel too So we let Matthew off a little more easily this time It be interest to note though how Matthew dress up the event The earlier gospel of Mark tell the tale with Jesus simply speak to a crowd Matthew have the Pharisees who become the religious competition of an infant Christianity be the target of Jesus 's question As we might expect Matthew writes that the event end up by embarrass the Pharisees Such power be the pen Moses Jesus Had it Together All Along ... We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John 's gospel The gospel story of John deserves special treatment because it seem to be so far remove from the real event of Jesus 's career a told by even Matthew But for the moment we will just look at one verse The early church leader found a religion on the Jewish hope of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promise make by G 'd When construct the history of Abraham Moses write of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people While this be accomplish eventually under the rule of king David the Christians who come along later decide that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise But to do so they expand on the promise preach about a heavenly kingdom John 8.56 J.C. speak Your father Abraham rejoice to see My day He say it and be glad It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham but Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah or anything Christian I have try and fail to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John 's little prophecy It be par for the course to see St. John make up Old Testament backing just like his forerunner Matthew Many Christians know that their faith have many of it foundation in such fraud and it be surprising they still cling to it The Potter's Field We be told that Jesus be betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his follower Judas Iscariot Matthew writes Mt 27.5-10 And throw down the piece of silver in the temple Judas depart ... But the chief priest take the silver say `` It be n't lawful for u to put it in the treasury since it be blood money '' So they ... bought a potter 's field with it to bury stranger in ... Then be fulfil what be spoken by the prophet Jeremiah `` And they take the thirty piece of silver the price of him on whom a price have be set by some of the son of Israel and they give them for the potter's field a the lord direct me '' This prophecy be an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture First Matthew have make a mistake regard the name of the prophet It be Zechariah who utters the verse which Matthew make use of Zech 11.12-13 ... And they weigh out my wage thirty shekel of silver Then YHVH say to me `` Cast them to the treasury '' -- the lordly price at which I be paid off by them So I take the thirty shekel of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of YHVH First of all the verse of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of G 'd The deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of preside over the people shortly before G 'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another The word `` treasury '' have be replace by the King James Scholars with `` to the potter '' precisely because this make Matthew 's quote fit well But this be a blatant error The correct translation of the Hebrew be indeed `` treasury '' which also make perfect sense in Zechariah 's context whereas `` potter's field '' be totally unrelated Whether the mistranslation be intentional or not seem to be beyond speculation However give Matthew 's track record one find it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty Of course Matthew would have ample reason for alter the text The thirty piece of silver match Judas 's situation and if a most Christians seem to be the reader be willing to disregard the contextual incongruity Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around However the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priest The high priest would not put the money in the treasury The worthless shepherd of Zechariah do exactly the opposite Of course to the average Thursday-Night Bible student the `` prophecy '' a present by Matthew would be take at New Testament face value To those Matthew 's work be convincing enough Wine Vinegar Casting Lots Then Jesus be lead away to be crucify Mt 27.34-35 ... they give him vinegar to drink mingle with gall but when he taste it he would not drink it And when they have crucify him they divide his garment among them by cast lot that it might be fulfil what be spoken by the prophet `` They part my garment among them and upon my vesture do they cast lot '' First of all the vinegar offer to Jesus be actually common sour wine of the type that Roman soldier drank regularly We find that right before Jesus dy the soldier themselves give him some to drink -- not pollute with gall Jn 19.28-30 Jesus ... say `` I thirst '' A bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth When he have receive the vinegar he say `` It be finish '' But Matthew seem to be draw on not a passage from the prophet but one from the Psalms Ps 69.20-28 I look for pity but there be none and for comforter but I found none They give me poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they give me vinegar to drink ... Add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee Let them be blot out of the Book of the Living Of course the sour wine offer to Jesus be do at his request of drink This do indeed seem to be a show of pity The psalm quote be about David and his political and military enemy It be not about the messiah or Jesus It be then not surprising that we run into far problem when we see that the `` Jesus '' in the psalm asks G 'd for the damnation of the `` crucifiers '' whereas the Jesus of the gospel say Lk 23.34 Jesus say `` Father forgive them the do n't know what they do '' Further Matthew miss with his attempt to create prophecy by have gall a bitter substance put into Jesus 's drink not his meat a the psalm stipulates With the `` prophecy '' of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask `` What of the cast of lot '' This brings up the 22nd Psalm which deserves discussion all by itself Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus 's clothes be divide a told be no great thing It turn out that this happen often to any felon in those day As we will soon see it be perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when apply to Jesus It do indeed bring up the interest question a to the quality of Jesus 's clothes For a man so remove from worldly possession his ownership of clothes worthy of cast lot raise some suspicion The 22nd Psalm This psalm be attribute to David a a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemy It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope Taken out of context part of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well We will examine the primary passage Verse 1-2 My god my god why have you forsaken me Why be you so far from help me far from the word of my groan Oh my god I cry by day but you do n't answer and by night but find no rest Jesus be say to have cry the first sentence while on the cross This suggests that the whole psalm be really about Jesus rather than king David Of course the rest of the first stanza do not fit a nicely to Jesus or his execution Jesus be not picture a complain about the whole ordeal he be suppose to be like `` the lamb lead mute before it shearer '' Indeed Jesus do n't do much groan even when on the cross He certainly do not cry by both day and night on the cross 6-8 But I be a worm and no man -- scorn by men ... All who see me mock at me They make face and wag their head `` He commit his cause to YHVH So let him deliver him ... for he delight in him '' This seem to fit Jesus 's execution pretty well with the exception of the Holy messiah be call a worm 12-13 Many bull encompass me ... they open their mouth widely at me like a raven and roar lion 16-18 Yea dog be round about me a company of evildoer encir-cle me they have pierce my hand and foot I can see all my bone ... They divide my garment among them and cast lose for my raiment 19-21 But you YHVH be not far away ... Deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog Save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflict soul from the horn of the wild bull It would seem quite convincing and I 'm sure the early Christian father who write of this prophecy thought so too Unfortunately this prophecy have a fatal flaw The word `` have pierce '' really do not exist in the psalm The correct Hebrew translation be 16 Yea dog be round about me a company of evildoer encircles me like the lion they be at my hand and foot ... In Hebrew the phrase `` like the lion '' and a very rare verb form which can mean `` pierce '' differ by one phonetic character The word in the Hebrew text be literally `` like the lion '' ka'ari which make sense in the context and even far fit the animal imagery employ by the psalm writer It be convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to `` ka'aru '' But to add the need yet artificial weight to the `` prophecy '' this be just what the Christian translator have chosen to do While the correct translation do not eliminate the psalm from refer to Jesus it absence do not say much for the honesty of the translator Apart from the erroneous verse 16 the psalm do not lend itself to Jesus so easily Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer be save from a sword rather than a cross This naturally fit the psalm 's true subject king David As a side note we now know that crucifixion do not pierce the hand the palm but rather the forearm This do n't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrect Jesus show his disciple the scar on his palm But then fact be n't bound by our religious belief Matthew escape culpability this time a he do not attempt to draw many direct link between this psalm and his lord Jesus But the psalm like many others be on the mind of all the gospel writer when they compile the story and interpretation of Jesus 's life and death How much these scripture may have contribute to what actually get write down be a question that have serious repercussion for Christian theology It be easy to see for those who be not faithful fundamentalist how some of the event in the New Testament might have be `` enhance '' by scribe such a the eager Matthew But it do less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matter and prophetic claim So far this have not say good thing for St. Matthew The reference to the pierce look a lot like Jesus's crucifixion John 's gospel recount write about 70 year after the fact tell u at Jesus 's execution Jn 19.34,37 But one of the soldier pierce his side with a spear and out come blood and water ... these thing take place that Scripture be fulfil ... `` The will look on him whom they 've pierce '' Of course this be built on a passage take blatantly out of context Prophet Zechariah tell u how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them Zc 12.7-10 And YHVH will give victory to Judah ... And on that day I will seek to destroy the nation that come against Jerusalem in Judah And I will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication ... on Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierce they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child John 's attempt to make up prophecy be perhaps weaker that Matthew 's attempt Matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage John 's error be grossly obvious and blatant here It do not speak well for any of the gospel writer a it help to show how the prophetic aspect of their religion be found Reckoned with Transgressors After his arrest Jesus be quickly execute for claim the Jewish kingship messiahship According to one version of the gospel tale Jesus get execute along with two thief Mk 15.27 And with him they crucify two robber one on his right one on his left And so the scripture be fulfil which say `` He be reckon with the transgressor '' Here Mark be try to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53 about the servant nation of Israel The passage be not about the messiah for if one read the whole chapter of Isaiah 53 and it surround chapter one see that the servant be a nation The verse be also about what this servant have go through in the past not a prediction of what be to come in any event The servant be thought of a a criminal This also happens to fit the description of Jesus Had the passage really be about the messiah it still be not at all clear why execute Jesus between two thief would fulfill the `` prophecy '' in Isaiah Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry He be consider a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career Locking onto a single event be a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case a we see that Mark could have have make a well analogy with general comparison Mark go on to tell u how `` those who be crucify with Jesus also revile him '' 15.32 This be to be expect from a couple of robber Of course in his later recount St. Luke decides to change some thing Luke tell u Lk 23.39-43 And one of the criminal who be hang with him rail `` Are n't you the messiah Save yourself and u '' This certainly fit with Mark 's recount which tell how the people who crucify Jesus say `` Save yourself '' and that the robber do the same But then Luke go on But the other criminal rebuke the first say `` Do n't you fear G 'd since you be under the same sentence of condemnation And we indeed justly so for we be receive the due reward for our deed But this man have do nothing wrong And he say `` Jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom '' And Jesus answer `` Verily I say to you today you will be with me in paradise '' Now this little dialogue seem highly contrive It stretch the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuke his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lament over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffer Such a man apparently noble and of principle do n't seem likely to have be a robber We wonder at the amount of theatrics create by Luke Of course Luke 's recount also disagrees with Mark 's Luke have only one criminal revile Jesus not both It be easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account be make up but those who wish to believe it be all part of the error free word of G 'd do not have this avenue open This be yet another example of a writer try to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology In this case the embroidery creates some embarrass problem a we have see The End of the World -- Mt 24 Now come perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrass passage in the New Testament It be found in all three of the synoptic gospel story and cast some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity Jesus mention the destruction of the Jewish temple and building and his disciple ask him about this and about the end of the world which he have be warn about The disciple Tell u when will this the temple's destruction be and what will be the sign of your come and of the close of the age Jesus Take care that no one lead you astray for many will come in my name say `` I be the christ '' ... you will hear of war and rumour of war ... for this must take place but the end be not yet For nation will rise against nation ... all this be but the begin of the birthpangs They will deliver you up ... put you to death and false prophet will arise and lead many astray ... But he who endures to the end will be save This gospel will be preach throughout the whole world a testimony to the nation and then the end will come So when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel ... let those who be in Judea flee to the mountain Immediately after the tribulation of those day the sun will be darken ... the star will fall from heaven ... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven and all the tribe of the earth will mourn and see the Son of Man come ... and he will send out his angel ... and gather his elect ... Learn the lesson of the fig tree a soon a it branch becomes tender and put forth leaf you know that summer be near So also when you see all these thing you will know that He be near at the very gate Truly I say to you this generation will not pas away until all these thing take place ... But of the day and hour no one know not the angel not the Son but only the Father ... Therefore you also must be ready for the Son of Man be come at an hour you do not expect From this it be clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetime of at least some of his disciple He tell them that although he do n't know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready Theologians have wet their pant in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error But unfortunately Jesus make himself to explicit He told his disciple that their generation would still be around at the End and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away There have be some who resort to remove the inerrant nature of the Bible and say that the phrase `` this generation shall not pas away ... '' really mean `` this race of people will not pas away ... '' Of course the word for generation be use many time to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciple It be an interest notion that when God decide to learn Greek he do n't learn it well enough to make himself clear But it be quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciple at least some of them be suppose to live to the End of the World The charge of mistranslation be completely blown away by look at the Apostles response It becomes abundantly clear from Rev 22.7 1 Peter 4.7 1 John 2.18 and Rev 22.20 that Jesus meant exactly what he say The End be very near For 2,000 year Christians have rationalise this 24th chapter of Matthew or ignore it meaning altogether For 2,000 year they have wait for their execute leader to come back hearing of war and rumour of war sure that He be come soon Surely He must be All we must do be wait Can you imagine how tire He must be sit around up there be holy wait for just the right moment to spring So shortly after his crucifixion Jesus of Nazareth Joshua-ben-Joseph die It be say that after three day or three day and three night or three period of time or three eternal second -- or three of whatever they can decide make for less trouble -- he be see again resurrect glow with divine radiance Then the Saviour decide it be n't in the best interest of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappear from sight into heaven So the story go anyway As have be see there be many thing attribute to Jesus when people get around to write the gospel story down To them Jesus be the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture We have see though that this matter be quite shaky But throughout Church history Christians have held fast to faith in simple belief What doctrinal objection could not be solve with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question To question and investigate have never be the easy way to treat matter Thus for 2,000 year the prophecy cite in the New Testament have go on largely accepted Things may well continue that way for some time Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrine of Christianity have be accepted and use properly or improperly to support war and persecution I suppose there be one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold

Try to find `` immoral '' non-mating-related activity So you 're exclude mating-related-activities from your `` natural morality '' No but mating practice be a special case I 'll have to think about it some more Yes I think that the natural system can be objectively deduce with the goal of specie propogation in mind But I be not equate the two a you so think That be an objective system be n't necessarily the natural one Are you or be you not the man who write '' A natural moral system be the objective moral system that most animal follow '' Indeed But while the natural system be objective all objective system be not the natural one So the term can not be equate The natural system be a subset of the objective one Now since homosexuality have be observe in most animal include bird and dolphin be you go to claim that `` most animal '' have the capacity of be immoral I do n't claim that homosexuality be immoral It be n't harmful although it be n't helpful either to the mating process And when you say that homosexuality be observe in the animal kingdom do n't you mean `` bisexuality '' Because we ca n't determine to what end we should be `` moral '' Are you claim to be a group `` We '' usually implies more than one entity This be standard jargon Read any textbook The `` we '' form be use throughout Well I 'm say that these goal be not inherent That be why they must be postulate because there be not really a way to determine them otherwise although it could be argue that they arise from the natural goal -- but they be somewhat remove Postulate To assume posit That 's right The goal themselves be n't inherent I can create a theory with a postulate that the Sun revolves around the Earth that the moon be actually make of green cheese and the star be the portion of Angels that intrudes into three-dimensional reality You could but such would contradict observation I can build a mathematical proof with a postulate that give the length of one side of a triangle the length of a second side of the triangle and the degree of angle connect them I can determine the length of the third side But a postulate be something that be generally or always found to be true I do n't think your postulate would be valid Guess which one people be go to be more receptive to In order to assume something about your system you have to be able to show that your postulate work Yes and I think the goal of survival and happiness *do* work You think they do n't Or be they not good goal
reply to frank D012S658.uucp Frank O'Dwyer I 'm one of those people who do not know what the word objective mean when put next to the word morality I assume it an idiom and can not be define by it separate term Give it a try Objective morality be morality built from objective value From A Dictionary of Philosophy by Anthony Flew '' Objectivism The belief that there be certain moral truth that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desire For instance 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffer might be thought of a a plausible example Even in a world of sadist who all reject it the contention remains true just a 5 7 12 remains correct even if there be no one left to count The problem for the objectivist be to determine the status of moral truth and the method by which they can be establish If we accept that such judgement be not report of what be but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they can not be prove by any fact about the nature of the world Nor can they be analytic since this would involve lack of action-guiding content 'One ought always to do the right thing be plainly true in virtue of the vords involve but it be unhelpful a a practical guide to action see analytic and synthetic At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truth but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self-evidence be in the mind of the beholder If not what be left of the claim that some moral judgement be true THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains be that there be some moral judgement with which he would wish to associate himself To hold a moral opinion be he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preference regard human activity ''

solntze.wpd.sgi.com Jon Livesey writes Should we British go around blowing up skyscraper next I do n't know if you be do so but it seem you be imply 1 that the person accuse of blowing up the WTC in NY actually do it and 2 that Islamic teaching have something to do with blowing up the WTC WTC World Trade Centre which be the building that be blown up I think Okay ... to make some comment ... 1 The person have only be accuse -- innocent until proven guilty remember Secondly there seem to be some hole in his accusation that I read about For instance if they guy use that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid Perhaps Salamen be one of those `` uneducated '' Muslims we hear so much about Nevertheless he be apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb It do n't seem to fit together somehow Actually Salameh be not the ONLY person involve The other fellow be a chemical engineer work for Allied Signal who have specifically study explosive device in school believe it or not we actually allow radical Muslim type to study thing like this in our university so much for the price of freedom From what I read the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone The bomb be supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a I assume complicate sophisticated bomb together from instruction _over the phone_ one must need some brain I would expect Despite this there have already be many attack and threat against mosque and Muslims in the United States a a consequence of his accusation I have read O.K. now please tell u where this be happen I live in the U.S. and I have heard very little about these mosque attack There be many mosque in Houston Texas and I would like to know what be go on so I can verify this Or be the Great Jewish Media Conspiracy keep u from know about this in the U.S. We heard about the mosque attack during the Desert Storm venture so why be it so quiet now Maybe it be localize to New Jersey I read this in an article in `` The Australian Muslim Times '' the newspaper weekly of the Australian Muslim community If this be true perhaps one of the Muslims base in North America if they see this post can elaborate 2 Islamic teaching teach against harm the innocent In the Qur'an it explicitly teach against harm innocent even in time of war The blowing up of the WTC and harm innocent be therefore in blatant contradiction to Islamic teaching This mean absolutely nothing Plenty of people commit violence while follow what they think be valid religious principle I have see people post many thing here from the Koran which could be `` misinterpret '' if that be the explanation you wish to use by an `` uneducated '' Muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbeliever The first thing every Muslim say be that no Muslim could have do that because Islam teach against harm innocent And we be suppose to take you WORD that it NEVER happens What do you think be the consequence Does Allah strike them down before the `` allege '' violence occurs Of course not Muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hide behind verse in the Koran We're pretty hip to that trick And I even doubt that it will come up in the trial '' My defense be that I be Muslim and Islam teach me not to harm the innocent Therefore the people who be kill must not have be innocent Sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir I be a Muslim Allah be all-powerful Allah would not have allow this Are you insult my religion '' Great defense eh Just admit that there be some incredibly stupid violent Muslims in the world and stop hiding from that fact It do no one any good to deny it It only make the more reasonable Muslims look like they be protect the bad one Can you see that I do n't deny this fact The thrust of my argument here be that a Salameh be accord to US law innocent a he have not be found guilty in a court of law As his guilt have not be establish it be wrong for people to make posting base on this assumption b Islam teach u _not_ to harm innocent If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realize that Islam teach this -- perform such action it be _not_ _because_ of the teaching of Islam but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teaching of Islam This be an important distinction I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say `` Muslim '' In general anyone who call themselves a `` Muslim '' and do not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teaching of Islam be consider to be a Muslim Thus one who might do thing contrary to Islam through ignorance for example do not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teaching and essential principle though then one do leave Islam The term `` Muslim '' be to be contrast with `` Mu'min '' which mean `` true believer '' However whether a Muslim be in reality a Mu'min be something know only by God and perhaps that person himself So you will not find the term Mu'min use very much by Muslims in alt.atheism because it be not know to anybody except myself and God whether I for example be a `` true believer '' or not For example I could just be put on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here without anyone know Thus when we say `` Muslims '' we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress Islamic teaching By '' Muslim '' we do not necessarily mean `` Mu'min '' or `` true believer '' in Islam

reply to zazen austin.ibm.com E. H.

I harbor no belief at all there be no good evidence for god exist or not Some folk call this agnosticism It do not suffer from `` blind faith '' at all I think of it a `` Do n't worry be happy '' For many atheist the lack of belief in god be secondary to an epistemological consideration what do we accept a a reliable way of know There be no know valid logical argument for the existence of god nor be there any empirical evidence that they exist Most philosopher and theologian agree that the idea of a god be one that must be accepted on faith Faith be belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence It be a reliable way of know There be probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof Even when we agree to take someone el word `` on faith '' we just mean that have found this person to be reliable in the past we judge him likely to be a reliable source now If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about god The difference between the atheist and the theist be fundamentally then one of whether or not faith be held to be a reliable way of know rather than a some agnostic poster would have it whether one faith be in god or no god The theist believe that faith be an acceptable basis for a belief in god even if he reject faith a reliable at other time for example in his work a a scientist The atheist believe that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge Agnosticism seem to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism unless one be a sceptic in regard to all other knowledge Without evidence why should we believe in god rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny I would also like to point out a others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of god I do n't believe that there be any such thing a absolute knowledge Atheism be the best and simplest theory to fit the lack of fact and so should be held until contrary evidence be found

mccullou whipple.cs.wisc.edu writes My turn I go back and reread your post All you do be attack atheism and say that agnosticism be n't a funny a atheism Nowhere do that imply that you be agnostic or weak atheist As most people who post such inflammatory remark be theist it be a reasonable assumption Sorry you 're right I do not clearly state it Rule *2 Condescending to the population at large i.e. theist will not win many people to your faith anytime soon It only ruin your credibility How be I be condescend to the population at large I be state something that happen to be true for a long time I could n't believe that people actually believe in this god idea It be an alien concept to me I be not try to win people to my faith a you put it I have no faith Religion be a non issue when I have the attitude above because it never even occur to me to believe Atheist by default I guess you could say The most common form of condescend be the rational versus irrational attitude Once one have accepted the _assumption_ that there be no god s and then consider other faith to be irrational simply because their assumption s contradict your assumption then I would say there 's a lack of consistency here Now I know you 'll get on me about faith If the _positive_ belief that God do not exist be a close logical argument why do so many rational people have problem with that `` logic '' But you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist Sorry for the flamage The line about atheist have something up their sleeve be what seem to imply that Sorry be reading too much on the CLIPPER project lately and the paranoia over there may have seep in some What be the CLIPPER project BTW Rule 4 Do n't mix apple with orange How can you say that the extermination by the Mongols be bad than Stalin Khan conquer people unsympathetic to his cause That be atrocious But Stalin kill million of his own people who love and worship _him_ and his atheist state How can anyone be bad than that Many ruler have do similar thing in the past only Stalin do it when there be plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him The evidence be that some of the early European ruler rule with an iron fist much like Stalin 's You threw in number and I be sick of hearing about Stalin a an example because the example do n't apply You manage to get me angry with your post because it appear to attack all form of atheism It might have appear to attack atheism in general but it point be that mass kill happens for all sort of reason People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammer sickle The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really do love him and his idea even after all that he have wrought The evidence I be refer to be more a lack of evidence than negative evidence Say I claim there be no pink crow I have never see a pink crow but that do n't mean it could n't exist But this person here claim that there be pink crow even though he admits he hasn't be able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me etc In a sense that be evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crow That be what I be say when I look at the evidence I look at the suppossed evidence for a deity show how it be flaw and do n't show what theist want it to show and go on First all the pink crows/unicorns/elves argument in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy Why One of the big reason be that many many people want something beyond this life You can pretend that they do n't want this but I for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes And there be nothing unique in this example of why people want a God Can love a a truth be proven logically themselves namely a god or god So in principle it 's hard to see how theist be necessarily arrogant Makes no sense to me They seem arrogant to make such a claim to me But my previous refutation still stand and I believe there may be another one on the net John the Baptist boast of Jesus to many people I find it hard to see how that behavior be arrogant at all Many Christians I know also boast in this way but I still do not necessarily see it a arrogance Of course I do know arrogant Christians doctor and teacher a well Technically you might consider the person who originally make a give claim to be arrogant Jesus for instance Are you talk about all atheism or just strong atheism If you be talk about weak atheism which I believe in then I refuse such a claim Atheism be a lack of belief I use good ol Occam 's Razor to make the final rejection of a deity in that a I see thing even if I present the hypothesis in an equal fasion I find the theist argument not plausible I speak against strong atheism I also often find that the evidence support a faith be very subjective just a say the evidence support love a truth be subjective I believe I answer that I apologize for the a you state incorrect assumption on your theism but I saw nothing to indicate that you be an agnostic only that you be just another newbie Christian on the net try to get some cheap shot in No apology necessary -- Bake Timmons III

The book say that Jesus be either a liar or he be crazy a modern day Koresh or he be actually who he say he be Well you should n't give any particular book too much weight Actually I do n't think that any of these statement be correct It be more likely that most of Jesus fame be attribute to him after his death by those who have some strong motif ... ... Some other thing to note He fulfil load of prophecy in the psalm Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hr alone What 's a prophecy and what 's so significant about them I do n't think most people understand what a Christian be I think we understand It be certainly not what I see a lot in church Rather I think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for God 's sake Well sell your computer and donate you life to your religion now ...

But if that 's how the Bible be actually be use today should n't that be how we should judge it If most people use scissors to cut paper should n't Consumer 's Reports test scissors for paper-cutting ability even though scissors may have be design originally to cut cloth That 's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teach Jewish morality today but it hardly seem fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version be what be `` enlighten for it time '' To attempt to extend the analogy this be like say that the original scissor-makers be unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their time even though they only ever cut cloth and have never even heard of paper I 'm not argue that the Bible be `` disgust '' though some of the history depict in it be by modern standard However history be full of similar abuse and I do n't think the Biblical account be bad than their contemporary -- or possibly ours On the other hand I do n't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible show *less* abuse than their contemporary or ours That complex and benign moral tradition have evolve base on particular mythic interpretation of that history be interest but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history

livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com Jon Livesey writes Much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this be probably the wrong group for it The only relevance here be that you do n't seem to be able to tell u what capital punishment actually be and when it be murder That be when you tell u murder be wrong you be use a term you have not yet define Well I 've say that when an innocent person have be execute this be objectively a murder However who be at blame be another question It seem that the entire society that sanction any sort of execution -- realize the risk -- be to blame There be a *probability* of kill an innocent person by shoot at random into the air and there be a *probability* of kill an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment So when you do either you know that they action you be take will sooner or later result in the kill of an innocent person Yes but there be also a probablity that you will kill someone do any raondom activity Presumably you have not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this And drive will kill people a will airline but people continue to do both Driving and fly be not punishment inflict on unwilling prisoner by Courts They be risk that we take upon ourselves willingly And I argue that our law system be a similar risk Perhaps an innocent person will be punish someday but we work to prevent this In fact many criminal go free a a result of our try to prevent punishment of innocent If our own drive kill someone else then sure there be a moral issue I know at least one person who be involve in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards But such accident be to be totally expect give the numner of vehicals on the road Again the blame be on society No I 'm not This be what you say You be say that if there be such a false witness that result in an innocent person be convict and kill it would still be the fault of the state since it do the actual kill No I just comment that the state do the kill It do not depend on there be false witness How could it The state do the kill even in the case of sincere mistake Yes but the state be not at fault in such a case The state can only do so much to prevent false witness It be possible So what be you try to say that capital punishment be always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidate the system I 'm say capital punishment be murder period Not because of this that and the other but because it involves take human life That 's *my* definition of murder I make no appeal to dictionary or to `` objective '' moral Okay so this be what you call murder But the question be whether or not all such `` murder '' be wrong Are you say that all take of human life be wrong no matter what the circumstance If we a a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and list our reason for do so and live with the moral consequence We should not play word game and pretend that murder be n't murder And that 's *my* opinion about how society ought to be run But this be basically how it work Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murder by execution And every member of society share this blame And most people 's definition of murder include some sort of malicious intent which be not involve in an execution be it But we be try to discus an objective moral system or at least it possibilty What ramification do your personal system have on an objective one No we be not discuss an objective moral system I be show you that you do n't have one because for one thing you be incapable of define the term in it for example `` murder '' Murder violates the golden rule Executions do not because by allow it at all society implicitly accepts the consequence no matter who the innocent victim be We 're not talk about reading mind we be just talk about know the truth Yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court system work on a principle of know the `` truth '' `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' Sorry but you simply be not quote yourself accurately Here be what you say '' And since we be look totally objectively at this case then we know what people be think when they be voting to execute the person or not If the intent be malicious and unfair then the execution would be murder '' What you be do now be to slide into another claim which be quite different The jury be *persuaded* beyond a serious doubt be not the same a u know what be in their mind beyond a serious doubt Reading the mind of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction be moral or not But in an objective system only the absolute truth matter and the jury system be one method to approximate such a truth That be twelve member must be convince of a truth Moreover a jury which come from a sufficiently prejudice background may allow itself to be persuade beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and I would laugh at But then if we read the mind of these people we would know that the conviction be unfair But would it be perfectly fair if we could read mind If we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why be it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth It 's not a question of fairness Your claim which I have quote above be a claim about whether we can *know* it be fair so a to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder Yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we ca n't always determine the difference in our flaw system I think that our system be almost a good a possible but it still be n't objectively perfect You see it do n't matter if we *know* it be fair or not Objectively it be either fair or it be not Now there 's a huge difference If we can read mind we can know and if we can not read mind we can know nothing The difference be not in degree of fairness but in what we can know But what we know have no effect on an objective system I think it be possible to produce a fairly objective system if we be clear on which goal it be suppose to promote I 'm not go to waste my time try to devise a system that I be pretty sure do not exist Why be you so sure I simply want people to confront reality *My* reality remember Why be *your* reality important In this case the reality be that `` ideal theory apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system For every innocent person release from Death Row there may have be a dozen innocent people execute or a hundred or none at all We simply do n't know But we can assume that the system be fairly decent at least most likely And you realize that the correctness of our system say nothing about a totally ideal and objective system Now what be we go to do On the one hand we can pretend that we have an 'ideal theory and that we can know thing we can never know and the Justie System be fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain type of kill not murder and go on our way Well we can have an ideal system but the work system can not be ideal We can only hope to create a system that be a close an approximation to the ideal system a possible On the other hand we can recognize that all Justice have a small we hope probability of punish the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequence of the system we set up and then say `` Well here we go murder again '' Maybe some of u will even say `` Gee I wonder if all this be strictly necessary '' Yes we all bear the responsibility Most people seem willing to do this I think that the second be preferable in that if require people to face the moral consequence of what we do a a society instead of shelter ourselves from them by magic ceremony and word game We must realize the consequence of all our action Why do you keep separate the justice system from the pack And l I forget I also do n't think we have an objective moral system and I believe I only have to take that idea seriously when someone present evidence of it I do n't think our country have an objective system but I think such an objective system can exist in theory Without omniscience an objective system be not possible in practice

We also have in the ASU library volume of British document on slavery where report and document concern slavery all around the world can be found which I checked some of the incident Lewis mention So I do n't think one political stance have anything to do with documentary evidence I have n't read Lewis 's article so I ca n't comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writing _in general_ so far that his political motif make him a bias writer on Islam His anti-Islamic polemic a I understand it be often quite subtle and be often base on tell half-truth Again read `` Orientalism '' by Edward Said I be _not_ ask you to take what I say on trust in fact I be urge you not to do so but to get this book it be a well-known book and check the evidence out for _yourself_ The issue I raise be that slave WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES when it be claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex I write that the Prophet himself have concubine I write an incident in which the prophet advise on someone who do not want his concubine to get pregnant etc. which be contrary to the notion that `` sex be for procreation only '' In other word such claim be baseless in the Quran and the Hadith If slavery be _in reality_ a oppose to in the practice of some Muslims oppose by Islam then use slave for sexual purpose be necessarily oppose too I seem to be unsuccesful in get through to you Islam be not `` advocate '' slavery Slavery be an exist institution in the 7th century It advise on slave be freed for good deed etc. which be nothing new Many culture saw this a a good thing What be the problem here But I can argue rightfully that slave be discourage about think about their status politically the Quran reward the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day you 'll be free But it be very understandable that I do not communicate with Muslims since they assume the Quran be from a `` God '' and I think it be a rule-based system impose on the society for preservation of the status quo Slaves be a part of this system the subordination of woman so that their function in society boil down to child-making be a part of this system etc I understand your point of view Selim -- I think rather it be _us_ who be not get through to _you_ Some of the point you repeat above I have already answer before Regarding woman I have make post after post on this subject show that Islam be not anti-woman etc However have you be completely ignore my posting or just miss them I just reposted a very good one under the title `` Islam and Women '' reposted from soc.religion.islam If this have already disappear from your site then please email me tell me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article IMHO your understand of the issue of woman in Islam be sadly deficient Regarding slave _my_ post on slavery -- the second one I make which be a repost of an article I write early last year -- be base completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verse and hadith to support it point of view Our approach be different -- you be argue from a historical standpoint and I be argue directly from the teaching of the Qur'an and hadith Now just because people say they be Muslims and perform a particular action do that automatically mean that their action be part of Islam even if it be oppose by the Qur'an and Sunnah No Of course not Let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you The Qur'an prohibits drinking Now if a person say `` I be a Muslim '' and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer do this now mean that Islam teach that people should drink beer Of course not and only an idiot would think so Do you see my point It be very natural to think that the author/authors of the Quran have no idea that the socio-economic structure they be advocate would experience at least two paradigm shift in 1400 year in the western culture first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution Well rule have change and the status quo have driven Muslim country into misery try to survive in a `` heathen '' world Muslim country have fail economically they be unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the uncomprimising economic rule in the Quran In fact the rise of Islam can easily be model after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquer place You be judging Islam here on capitalist term Capitalism be an ideology base largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption be in opposition to Islamic teaching To say Islam be bad because it be not capitalist be pretty unthinking -- Islam do not pretend to be capitalist and do not try to be capitalist This do not mean that Islam do not support a free-market -- for it do in general -- but there be other part of capitalism which be oppose to Islam a I understand it When this stop you and I be left bare in the open for emperialists to devour No capital no industry very poor social service the education level in Muslim country be the low in the world the health statistic be miserable etc.. One can postulate numerous reason for this Your theory be that it be because Islam be not secularist and capitalist etc etc Selim I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your view if you think a you obviously do that Islam lack of education and power For a large part of history the Islamic world be very powerful For a significant section of history the Islamic world be the foremost in the science So to say that Islam be for example anti-education be completely absurd You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history show that your conclusion be false and that instead there must be other reason for this situation You blame Muslims for not follow the Quran but I blame Muslims for follow the Quran Well Selim your viewpoint on woman in Islam make me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam I really think you be not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims be follow the Qur'an or not Your idea be baseless from historical fact it be a poor utopia The Islamic world be at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow in your theory it be by `` follow the Qur'an '' that Muslims be backwards in education Selim it be _your_ thesis that be anti-historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory while my idea be derive from social and economic history You have certainly not show this you have merely state it So far it seem to me that your view on Islam be anti-education be quite contrary to history That you be so convince of your view make me wonder just how objectively you be try to look at all of this My solution to all Muslims be simple CUT THE CRAP I think Selim you should consider take your own advice GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT Here too AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE Selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of Islam but also of Islamic history particularly with respect to Muslims be leader of science till about 1400 or so I think Yet you say that your viewpoint be base on history Selim if I remember right you say in one of your earlier post that you be an apostate from Islam I think you should slow down and start think clearly about the issue and start _reading_ some of our posting about Islam rather than ignore them a you so obviously have

What strike me a self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall which by the way I seem to recall to be more speculation than base on biblical text but my ex RCism may be show be that a Benedikt point out Lucifer have perfect nature yet he have the free will to `` choose '' evil But where do that choice come from We know from Genesis that Eve be offer an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume be Satan but how do Lucifer discover invent create call the action what you will something that God have not give origin to Also where in the Bible be there mention of Lucifer 's free will We make a big fuss about mankind have free will but it strike me a be an after-the-fact rationalisation and in fact like salvation not one that all Christians believe in identically At least in my mind salvation and free will be very tightly couple but then my theology be Roman Catholic ... Still how do theologian explain Lucifer 's fall If Lucifer have perfect nature do man how could he fall How could he execute an act that a contradict his nature and b in effect cause evil to exist for the first time

So then you require the same amount of evidence to believe that I a own a pair of bluejeans and b have superhuman power Well I could use the argument that some here use about `` nature '' and claim that you can not have superhuman power because you be a human superhuman power be beyond what a human have and since you be a human any power you have be not beyond those of a human Hence you can not have superhuman power Sound good to you Anyway to the evidence question it depends on the context In this group since you be post from a american college site I 'm willing to take it a give that you have a pair of blue jean And assume there be some coherency in your position I will take it a a give that you do not have superhuman power Arguments be evidence in themselves in some respect When you say the `` existence of sic Jesus '' I assume that you mean just the man without any special power etc Yep Many will agree that it be very possible that a man call Jesus DID in fact live In fact I be willing to agree that there be some man name Jesus I have no reason to believe that there be n't ever a man Good However most of the claim ARE extradinary eg virgin birth virgin in the sense of not have any sexual intercourse resurection Son of God etc THOSE claim require extra evidence `` Extra '' evidence Why do n't we start with evidence at all I can not see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynic in this group would ever accept As for the second it be the foundation of the religion Anyone who claim to have see the risen Jesus back in the 40 day period be a believer and therefore be discount by those in this group since these be all ancient anyway one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing The third be a much a metaphysical relationship a anything else -- even those who agree to it have argue at length over what it *means* so again I do n't see how evidence be possible I thus interpret the `` extraordinary claim '' claim a a statement that the speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter

In article 1993Apr2.155057.808 batman.bmd.trw.com jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com writes why do baby get disease etc What God do create be life accord to a protein code which be mutable and can evolve Without delve into a deep discussion of creationism v evolutionism Here 's the main problem The scenario you outline be reasonably consistent but all the evidence that I be familiar with not only do not support it but indicates something far different The Earth by late estimate be about 4.6 billion year old and have have life for about 3.5 billion of those year Humans have only be around for at most about 200,000 year But the fossil evidence inidcates that life have be change and evolve and in fact disease-ridden long before there be people Yes there be fossil that show sign of disease ... mostly bone disorder of course but there be some Heck not just fossil evidence but what we 've be able to glean from genetic study show that disease have be around for a long long time If human sin be what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before human God create the original genetic code perfect and without flaw And without get sidetrack into the theological ramification of the original sin the main effect of the so-called original sin for this discussion be to remove humanity from God 's protection since by their choice A E cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with God In addition their sin cause them to come under the dominion of Satan who then assume dominion over the earth ... deletion Since humanity be no longer under God 's protection but under Satan's dominion it be no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer disease both bacterial/viral and genetic Although the force of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this Uh ... I know of many evolutionary biologist who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this There be no evidence that the human genetic code or any other 'started off' in perfect condition It seem to adapt to it envionment in a collective sense I 'm really curious a to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code Human DNA be more `` complex '' tends to accumulate error adversely affect our well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler DNA of bacteria and virus tend to become more efficient in cause infection and disease It be a bad combination Umm Nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapt to virus and bacteria and they to u Only a very small percentage of microlife be harmful to human ... and that small percentage seem to be reasonalby constant in size but the rank keep change For example bubonic plague use to be a really nasty disease I 'm sure you 'll agree But it still pop up from time to time even today ... and do n't do a much damage Part of that be because of well sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptom tend to be less severe than in the past This seem to be partly because people who be very susceptible die off long ago and because the really nasty variant 'overgrazed forgive the poor terminology I 'm an engineer not a doctor and die off for lack of nearby host I could be wrong on this but from what I gather acne be only a few hundred year old and use to be nastier though no killer It seem to be get less nasty w/age ... Hence we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases/disorders Now wait a minute I have a question Humans be create perfect right And you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease It seem unlikely that Satan who 's make the disease would also gift human with the mean to fight them off Simpler to make the disease less lethal if he want survivor As far a I can see our immune system imperfect though they may presently be must have be built into u by God I want to be clear on this be you say that God be planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that be not at the time of design necessary That be God make our immune system ahead of time know that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendent would need to fight off disease This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you be prepared to accept but God be not responsible for disease Even if Satan have nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produce them since humanity forsook God 's protection Here 's another puzzle What exactly do you mean by 'perfect in the phrase 'created ... perfect and without flaw To my mind a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrade over time A 'perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect be *not* a perfect system At least IMHO Or be it that God do something like write a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrapper held together with Elmer 's glue That be the original genetic 'instructions be perfect but be 'written in inferior material that have to be carefully tend or would fall apart If so why could God not have use well material Was God *incapable* of create a system that could maintain itself of do It just choose not to deletion In summary newborn be innocent but God do not cause their suffer My main point a I say be that there really be n't any evidence for the explanation you give At least that I 'm aware of But I couldn't help make a few nitpicks here and there Sincerely

your foolishness Consider also the death that have result from people reject medicine in favour of prayer Another flaw in the argument be that it be base on the assumption that the two possibility be equally likely -- or at least that they be of comparable likelihood If in fact the possibility of there be a God be close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive So sadly the argument be only likely to convince those who believe already Also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief be base on evidence with some amount of intuition It be not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis Formally speak the argument consists of four statement 1 One do not know whether God exists 2 Not believe in God be bad for one 's eternal soul if God do exist 3 Believing in God be of no consequence if God do not exist 4 Therefore it be in one 's interest to believe in God There be two approach to the argument The first be to view 1 a an assumption and 2 a a consequence of it One problem with this approach in the abstract be that it creates information from no information This be consider invalid in information theory Statement 1 indicates one have no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gain from the absolute lack of information about God This violates information entropy -- information have be extract from no information at no `` cost '' The alternative approach be to claim that 1 and 2 be both assumption The problem with this be that 2 be then basically an assumption which state the Christian position and only a Christian will agree with that assumption The argument thus collapse to `` If you be a Christian it be in your interest to believe in God '' -- a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal intend the argument to be view The big reason why Pascal 's wager be a failure be that if God be omniscient he will certainly know who really believe and who believe a a wager He will spurn the latter ... assume he actually care at all whether people believe in him -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject What be Occam 's Razor Typical post People keep talk about Occam 's Razor What be it Response William of Occam formulate a principle which have become know a Occam 's Razor In it original form it say `` Do not multiply entity unnecessarily '' That be if you can explain something without suppose the existence of some entity then do so Nowadays when people refer to Occam 's Razor they generally express it more generally for example a `` Take the simplest solution '' The relevance to atheism be that we can look at two possible explanation for what we see around u 1 There be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which come into be a a result of natural process 2 There be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there be also a God who create the universe Clearly this God must be of non-zero complexity Given that both explanation fit the fact Occam 's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one Unfortunately some argue that there be a third even more simple solution 3 There be n't an

in God Do you think you 're cleverer than him Response Einstein do once comment that `` God do not play dice with the universe '' This quotation be commonly mention to show that Einstein believe in the Christian God Used this way it be out of context it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainty indicate by quantum theory Furthermore Einstein 's religious background be Jewish rather than Christian A well quotation show what Einstein thought about God be the follow '' I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a God who concern himself with fate and action of human being '' Einstein be unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random event and which would not be dependent upon the observer He believe that QM be incomplete and that a well theory would have no need for statistical interpretation So far no such well theory have be found and much evidence suggests that it never will be A longer quote from Einstein appear in `` Science Philosophy and Religion A Symposium '' publish by the Conference on Science Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life Inc. New York 1941 In it he say `` The more a man be imbue with the order regularity of all event the firmer becomes his conviction that there be no room left by the side of this order regularity for cause of a different nature For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists a an independent cause of natural event To be sure the doctrine of a personal God interfere with natural event could never be *refuted* italic his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domain in which scientific knowledge have not yet be able to set foot But I be convince that such behavior on the part of representative of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal For a doctrine which be to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose it effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress In their struggle for the ethical good teacher of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God that be give up that source of fear and hope which in the past place such vast power in the hand of priest In their labor they will have to avail themselves of those force which be capable of cultivate the Good the True and the Beautiful in humanity itself This be to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task ... '' Einstein have also say `` It be of course a lie what you read about my religous conviction a lie which be be systematically repeat I do not believe in a personal God and I have never deny this but have express it clearly If something be in me which can be call religious then it be the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far a our science can reveal it '' The latter quote be from `` Albert Einstein The Human Side '' edit by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman and publish by Princeton University Press Also from the same book `` I do not believe in immortality of the individual and I consider ethic to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it '' Of course the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity do not in itself imply that

-- Subject The universe be so complex it must have be design Typical post The presence of design in the universe prof there be a God Surely you do n't think all this appear here just by chance Response This be know a the Argument From Design It be a matter of dispute whether there be any element of design in the universe Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creature on the earth be evidence of a creator be best advise to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while There be insufficient space to summarize both side of that debate here However the conclusion be that there be no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism Furthermore there be much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexity of the universe and life on earth The origin of the Argument by Design be a feel that the existence of something a incredibly intricate a say a human be so improbable that surely it ca n't have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence direct thing so that human come from the chaos deliberately But if human intelligence be so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashion an entire universe complete with conscious being must be immeasurably more unlikely The approach use to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turn around and apply to the Creationist position This lead u to the familiar theme of `` If a creator create the universe what create the creator `` but with the addition of spiral improbability The only way out be to declare that the creator be not create and just `` be '' or `` be '' From here we might a well ask what be wrong with say that the universe just `` be '' without introduce a creator Indeed Stephen Hawking in his book '' A Brief History of Time '' explains his theory that the universe be close and finite in extent with no begin or end The Argument From Design be often state by analogy in the so-called Watchmaker Argument One be ask to imagine that one have found a watch on the beach Does one assume that it be create by a watchmaker or that it evolve naturally Of course one assumes a watchmaker Yet like the watch the universe be intricate and complex so the argument go the universe too must have a creator The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaw over and above those common to all Arguments By Design Firstly a watchmaker creates watch from pre-existing material whereas God be claimed to have create the universe from nothing These two sort of creation be clearly fundamentally different and the analogy be therefore rather weak Secondly a watchmaker make watch but there be many other thing in the world If we walk far along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we would n't assume it be create by the watchmaker The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creator each responsible for a different part of creation Finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch be not part of nature because it be order and therefore stand out from the randomness of nature Yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe be obviously not random but show element of order The Watchmaker argument be thus internally inconsistent -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject Independent evidence that the

MVS104 psuvm.psu.edu writes Many people would probably think especially if the fanatic propogandized this that this be a conflict between the atheist and the religious Many would get the impression that we be try to outlaw religion if we contintue to try to remove all thing with a religious reference That 's not what the people I 've ask think Perhaps you would be right if you say the fundamentalist would think this way after all they think they be be oppress when they be not allow to oppress However you have not show where you get this idea that 'many people would 'probably think it 's atheism vs. religion winner take all As far a I can tell it be your groundless prediction that this will happen But you have n't take into the account of propoganda Remember if you ask Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughter they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine roll through at least some be able to tolerate it You see it only take a small group of fanatic to whip up a general frenzy THe propoganda machine have be in gear over a number of issue include abortion and gay ... look at some of the thing that have happen Well so far they have pass one amendment which be currently under intense scrutiny and they have fail to outlaw abortion which be their prime goal on that issue Yep they seem sooo effective Sure Well they have n't manage to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the court But they have manage to create quite a few problem for people that want to have an abortion They could create similar problem for u And it could be bad They can try to stop abortion by block clinic etc. but imagine what they 'd have to do to stop atheism Besides the margin of error be very large when you only talk to two people Better than your one that be your opinion Also I have branch out and the informal survey be up over half a dozen now And what have they say Were you question unbiased Keith you would claim that my question be bias the minute I post them because the answer agree with me Everyone I have ask about the possible removal of the motto the christian portion have express regret about it loss because they like it However when it be point out to them that a new motto will not be in the work none have express the desire to rape murder pillage etc. which you have basically claimed So you be able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them A whole nation As for the atheist portion I know some around here they have all express disgust with the motto Some note be harass by christian who use the motto to try to seem justified And all would see it go Yes I 'd be glad if it be go to I 've never support it However I think that it be a minor problem that can be easily ignore contrast with what *could* happen an what may be likely Which Christians design the motto Does the motto say anything about Jesus Why do you think that it refers *only* to Christians Christians write it christian think that their religion be right and all others be wrong therefore why would they 'include other religion in the realm of be correct I doubt that any other religion be meant to be include Well I be not clear on the religious conviction of Francis Scott Key the motto can be attribute to him but it be at least clear that he believe in a god And surely there be a few Christians that think a you say but I do n't think that most do Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religion Most that I have met have n't and do n't do so No christian that I have query think it mean anything but them and only them Why not ask some people of other faith Sorry I would but christianity be just so awfully popular around here Suppose you could ask a few people Well I have ask a Hindu Moselem and a few Jews and all of them think that it be applicable to them Of course I ca n't say that these people just some that I know pretty well be accurate representation of their faith It be always a good idea to assume that there be dissent view on any give issue You be assume that all the view be the same and nothing lead to this conclusion Without evidence to the contrary I doubt that there be dissent opinion You claim there be Provide some evidence for your assertion Well I 'd really like to and I 've try but I really do n't know where to get access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950 's Can anyone help out here Comparing christian to Nazis Interesting Only in the sense that neither can probably convince to change their belief No again the motto on the money do n't cost you anything extra However if you abolish the motto we 'd all have to pay to have all the dy and plate redone Like people paid before to get them change to have the motto on them You now need to show that there be a good reason to change everything again ... Also I doubt that they use th3 same plate for more than a year 's printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next year 's plate without it Your claim evidently be that they will have to pay extra somewhere Provide some evidence for this assertion So be you say that they redesign the plate each year Anyway your whole argument conveniently delete I see be that the motto somehow cost u all a lot of money This be just not correct The one I read do n't mention anything about Jesus I think the issue be concern the distinction between religion and not How could it be between religious and not religious The motto refers to god it be a religious motto The question be whether or not it be only christian You say it be more I doubt this Provide some evidence for this assertion That be to say the religion of this country and the non-religion of the USSR That be what most of those quote be about and some include all atheist in general a well I do n't think that any of the quote although I seem to have lose them mention anything at all about Jesus They advocate religion over non-religion A specific religion be not mention You have miss this point I say that the motto do n't say anything about anyone in particular That be the motto do n't imply anything about *your* particular belief It do n't say that everyone trust in some form of god only that the nation on the whole do We have be through this before It 's obvious it do not include me this much be beyond doubt Your claim again be that the motto refers to more than christian Based on the fact that christianity say all other religion be wrong and because it seem that the motto be write by christian I doubt your claim So you be say that all Christians must believe that all other religion should be outlaw just because they think they be wrong That 's silly I think the Flat-Earthers be wrong but I do n't advocate their banishment ... Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would even be incur by remove the motto Provide some evidence for your claim that it would I think that any such cost would be insignificant I mention the slight cost because you say that the motto be cost u a lot of money by be on our currency Disregarding the digression of the other motto ... If it be use for harassment and no other purpose have be found for it why should it not be remove Well motto in general do n't really have purpose ... I do n't think it should be remove because I think the benefit would be outweigh by the consequence And do you know what the vote be Were there other opinion Do you think that the main reason the motto be require by law be to bother atheist Do you think that this be what the majority of congress at the time have in mind If you do then show why Again it be the opinion of the people who put it there that I be concerned with Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress Again it be not necessary that the complete majority share the purpose of confront 'godless Communism with this motto Why not It be the majority that put it there The general public probably do not know about the anti-atheist intent of a few people in the 50 's either I daresay more people remember the 50 's than the time when Key write the anthem But do they remember the debate surround the motto Do they remember that some people intend it to be a message against atheist Why don't you include this in your little survey that you be conduct ... You claim here that scientist would believe someone 's claim I doubt this Provide evidence for your assertion What Should I ask some scientist the probability that something Einstein say about relativity be worthy I mean if Einstein say it there 's a good chance that it be right at least at the time As for the court the method scientist use can be apply I need not agree with the court by default because of a 'good record You need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decision would be good evidence in favor of some point What But you say you do n't agree with the court because they `` allow Congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibit flag burning '' If you do n't realize that something like this be external to the realm of the court 's power then how can I be confident that you know *anything* about the court 's power I mean if you do n't know how the court work how can you participate in a discussion of the court A judge can go to speak before Congress And still you ignore the abortion gag rule a you make your claim on abortion No I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment And in order for the Court to rule on something a case usually must be present Mushrooms flower tree building sign whatever ... the analogy be the same Just because something that I might find offensive be present do n't mean that my right be be violate We be talk about something put there by people Keith ... not a mushroom No one cause that mushroom to exist unless you're find thing offensive in a mushroom farm Yes some mushroom can be plant And I do n't appreciate mushroom on my pizza either This be not the case with the motto And you 're ignore the harassment which be the only know result of the motto and you 're ignore that somewhere along the line people be force to put the motto there Who be force to put the motto there What do you mean

livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com Jon Livesey writes I want to know how this omniscient be be go to perform the feat of `` definitely '' term action right or wrong If you be omniscient you 'd know who exactly do what and with what purpose in mind Then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action be in accordance with the general goal I do n't think you 've show the existence of *any* objective moral system They exist but in practice they be difficult to perfectly emulate I mean you understand the concept of an objective system right I thought you be explain it to u I certainly don't understand what you be explain In an objective system there be know goal Then action be judged a either be compatible with these goal or not Simple The problem with most system in current practice be that the goal differ That be the goal of each society be different Note that an objective system be not necessarily an inherent one The concept of innocence be dependent on whether certain action be '' right '' or `` wrong '' and this depends on the moral system But if we have an objective system then someone can be deem innocent or not quite easily by an omniscient person Anyway I think I clear up the recursive definition of `` murder '' because no one be complain about it I do n't think it solves anything to speculate where we would be if we *did* have an objective moral system The question be still whether you can even say what one be I 've say it many many time And for what it 's worth I do n't think you clear up *anything* concern murder Which part do you have a problem with What do you mean by `` harm '' Is it harm if you have to spend your existence metabolise food for another specie Oh most moral system would be consider only within a specie It be okay for u to enslave other animal right But not human ... Of course ideally perhaps we would n't even have to bother any other animal ... One the first point it 's wrong to enslave human accord to my persoanl moral system On the second point I 'm a vegetarian But we can enslave the animal right But just not kill them Or be you a vegetarian for health reason So be you a vegetarian No I fail to see how my *personal* view be relevant anyway Is it wrong to eat animal in your personal moral system Of course not It seem perfectly valid to kill member of other specie for food It might be nice though if the other animal be not make to suffer For instance a cow in a field life out it life just about the same way it would in the wild They seem happy enough However the veal youngster be n't treat very well How about an `` objective '' moral system I do n't know What be the goal of this particular system There be no inherent system How about a `` natural '' moral system Nope Again it seem okay to kill other specie for food
acooper mac.cc.macalstr.edu write I wonder how many atheist out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheist be the majority rather than the minority group of the population I 've be think about this every now and then since I cut my tie with Christianity It be surprising to note that a large majority of people at least in Finland seem to be apatheists even though 90 of the population be member of the Lutheran Church of Finland religious people be actually a minority Could it be possible that many people believe in god `` just in case '' It seem people do not want to seek the truth they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor argument A small minority of those who do believe read the Bible regularly The majority do n't care it believe but do n't know what or how People do n't usually allow their belief to change their lifestyle they only want to keep the virtual gate open A Christian would say that they be not `` born in the Spirit '' but this do not disturb them Religion be not something to think about I 'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority be an impossible dream Religions have a strong appeal to people nevertheless a promise of life after death be something human eagerly listen to Coupled with threat of eternal torture and the idea that our morality be under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop too many people take the poison with a smile Or just pretend to swallow and unconsciously hope god would n't notice Also how many atheist out there would actually take the stance and accor a high value to their way of think over the theistic way of think The typical selfish argument would be that both line of think evolve from the same inherent motivation so one be not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively But then again a measure stick must be drawn somewhere and if we can not assign value to a system of belief at it core than the only other alternative be to apply it to it periphery ie how it express it own selfishness If logic and reason be value then I would claim that atheistic think be of high value than the theistic exposition Theists make unnecessary assumption they believe in I 've yet to see good reason to believe in god or to take a leap of faith at all A revelation would do However why do we value logic and reason This question bear some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science why mathematics work Strong deep structuralists like Atkins have propose that perhaps after all everything _is_ mathematics Is usefulness any criterion Petri

Archive-name atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name logic Last-modified 5 April 1993 Version 1.4 Constructing a Logical Argument Although there be much argument on Usenet the general quality of argument found be poor This article attempt to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improve the general level of debate Logic be the science of reason proof think or inference Concise OED Logic allows u to analyze a piece of reason and determine whether it be correct or not valid or invalid Of course one do not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic be often helpful when construct or analyze an argument Note that no claim be be make here about whether logic be universally applicable The matter be very much open for debate This document merely explains how to use logic give that you have already decide that logic be the right tool for the job Propositions or statement be the building block of a logical argument A proposition be a statement which be either true or false for example `` It be rain '' or `` Today be Tuesday '' Propositions may be either assert say to be true or deny say to be false Note that this be a technical meaning of `` deny '' not the everyday meaning The proposition be the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of word use to express it So `` God exists '' and `` There exists a God '' both express the same proposition An argument be to quote the Monty Python sketch `` a connect series of statement to establish a definite proposition '' An argument consists of three stage First of all the proposition which be necessary for the argument to continue be state These be call the premise of the argument They be the evidence or reason for accept the argument and it conclusion Premises or assertion be often indicate by phrase such a `` because '' '' since '' `` obviously '' and so on The phrase `` obviously '' be often view with suspicion a it can be use to intimidate others into accept suspicious premise If something do n't seem obvious to you do n't be afraid to question it You can always say `` Oh yes you 're right it be obvious '' when you 've heard the explanation Next the premise be use to derive far proposition by a process know a inference In inference one proposition be arrive at on the basis of one or more other proposition already accepted There be various form of valid inference The proposition arrive at by inference may then be use in far inference Inference be often denote by phrase such a `` implies that '' or '' therefore '' Finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which be affirm on the basis of the premise and inference Conclusions be often indicate by phrase such a `` therefore '' `` it follow that '' `` we conclude '' and so on The conclusion be often state a the final stage of inference For example Every event have a cause premise The universe have a begin premise All beginning involve an event premise This implies that the begin of the universe involve an event inference Therefore the universe have a cause inference and conclusion Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument A proposition can only be call a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the term do not make sense in isolation Sometimes an argument will not follow the order give above for example the conclusion might be state first and the premise state afterwards in support of the conclusion This be perfectly valid if sometimes a little confuse Recognizing an argument be much harder than recognize premise or conclusion Many people shower their write with assertion without ever produce anything which one might reasonably describe a an argument Some statement look like argument but be not For example '' If the Bible be accurate Jesus must either have be insane an evil liar or the Son of God '' This be not an argument it be a conditional statement It do not assert the premise which be necessary to support what appear to be it conclusion It also suffers from a number of other logical flaw but we'll come to those later Another example '' God create you therefore do your duty to God '' The phrase `` do your duty to God '' be not a proposition since it be neither true nor false Therefore it be not a conclusion and the sentence be not an argument Finally causality be important Consider a statement of the form `` A because B '' If we 're interested in establish A and B be offer a evidence the statement be an argument If we 're try to establish the truth of B then it be not an argument it be an explanation For example '' There must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start '' -- This be an argument `` My car will not start because there be something wrong with the engine '' -- This be an explanation There be two traditional type of argument deductive and inductive A deductive argument be one which provide conclusive proof of it conclusion -- that be an argument where if the premise be true the conclusion must also be true A deductive argument be either valid or invalid A valid argument be define a one where if the premise be true then the conclusion be true An inductive argument be one where the premise provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion Inductive argument be not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they be well or bad than other argument and about how probable their premise be There be form of argument in ordinary language which be neither deductive nor inductive However we will concentrate for the moment on deductive argument a they be often view a the most rigorous and convincing It be important to note that the fact that a deductive argument be valid do not imply that it conclusion hold This be because of the slightly counter-intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully Obviously a valid argument can consist of true proposition However an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false proposition For example All insect have wing premise Woodlice be insect premise Therefore woodlouse have wing conclusion Here the conclusion be not true because the argument 's premise be false If the argument 's premise be true however the conclusion would be true The argument be thus entirely valid More subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premise a in All fish live in the sea premise Dolphins be fish premise Therefore dolphin live in the sea conclusion However the one thing we can not do be reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premise We can therefore draw up a `` truth table '' for implication The symbol `` '' denotes implication `` A '' be the premise `` B '' the conclusion `` T '' and `` F '' represent true and false respectively Premise Conclusion Inference A B A= B -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- F F T If the premise be false and the inference F T T valid the conclusion can be true or false T F F If the premise be true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid T T T If the premise be true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true A sound argument be a valid argument whose premise be true A sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion Be careful not to confuse valid argument with sound argument To delve far into the structure of logical argument would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy It be simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfall to be avoid when construct an argument These pitfall be know a fallacy In everyday English the term `` fallacy '' be use to refer to mistaken belief a well a to the faulty reason that lead to those belief This be fair enough but in logic the term be generally use to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appear valid or convincing So for the purpose of this discussion we define a fallacy a a logical argument which appear to be correct but which can be see to be incorrect when examine more closely By study fallacy we aim to avoid be mislead by them The follow list of fallacy be not intend to be exhaustive ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM APPEAL TO FORCE The Appeal to Force be commit when the arguer resort to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion It be often use by politician and can be summarize a `` might make right '' The force threaten need not be a direct threat from the arguer For example '' ... Thus there be ample proof of the truth of the Bible All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell '' ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM Argumentum ad hominem be literally `` argument direct at the man '' The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when instead of try to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attack the person or people make the assertion This be invalid because the truth of an assertion do not depend upon the goodness of those assert it For example '' Atheism be an evil philosophy It be practise by Communists and murderer '' Sometimes in a court of law doubt be cast upon the testimony of a witness by show for example that he be a know perjurer This be a valid way of reduce the credibility of the testimony give by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it do not demonstrate that the witness's testimony be false To conclude otherwise be to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem be commit when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent 's particular circumstance For example '' It be perfectly acceptable to kill animal for food How can you argue otherwise when you 're quite happy to wear leather shoe '' This be an abusive charge of inconsistency use a an excuse for dismiss the opponent 's argument This fallacy can also be use a a mean of reject a conclusion For example '' Of course you would argue that positive discrimination be a bad thing You 're white '' This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem when one alleges that one's adversary be rationalize a conclusion form from selfish interest be also know a `` poison the well '' ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ad ignorantium mean `` argument from ignorance '' This fallacy occurs whenever it be argue that something must be true simply because it have not be prove false Or equivalently when it be argue that something must be false because it have not be prove true Note that this be not the same a assume that something be false until it have be prove true a basic scientific principle Examples '' Of course the Bible be true Nobody can prove otherwise '' `` Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomenon do not exist Nobody have show any proof that they be real '' Note that this fallacy do not apply in a court of law where one be generally assume innocent until proven guilty Also in scientific investigation if it be know that an event would produce certain evidence of it have occur the absence of such evidence can validly be use to infer that the event do not occur For example '' A flood a described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth The earth do not have a tenth a much water even if we count that which be frozen into ice at the pole Therefore no such flood occur '' In science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something have not occur We can not conclude with certainty that it have not occur however ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM This be the Appeal to Pity also know a Special Pleading The fallacy be commit when the arguer appeal to pity for the sake of get a conclusion accepted For example '' I do not murder my mother and father with an axe Please do n't find me guilty I 'm suffer enough through be an orphan '' ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM This be know a Appealing to the Gallery or Appealing to the People To commit this fallacy be to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appeal to a large group of people This form of fallacy be often characterize by emotive language For example '' Pornography must be ban It be violence against woman '' `` The Bible must be true Millions of people know that it be Are you try to tell them that they be all mistaken fool '' ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM This fallacy be closely related to the argumentum ad populum It consists of assert that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it be that that proposition be correct ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM The Appeal to Authority us the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion For example '' Isaac Newton be a genius and he believe in God '' This line of argument be not always completely bogus for example reference to an admit authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject For example we can distinguish quite clearly between '' Stephen Hawking have conclude that black hole give off radiation '' and '' John Searle have conclude that it be impossible to build an intelligent computer '' Hawking be a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinion on black hole radiation to be inform Searle be a linguist so it be questionable whether he be well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT The Fallacy of Accident be commit when a general rule be apply to a particular case whose `` accidental '' circumstance mean that the rule be inapplicable It be the error make when one go from the general to the specific For example '' Christians generally dislike atheist You be a Christian so you must dislike atheist '' This fallacy be often commit by moralist and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically apply general rule CONVERSE ACCIDENT HASTY GENERALIZATION This fallacy be the reverse of the fallacy of accident It occurs when one form a general rule by examine only a few specific case which be not representative of all possible case For example '' Jim Bakker be an insincere Christian Therefore all Christians be insincere '' SWEEPING GENERALIZATION DICTO SIMPLICITER A sweep generalization occurs when a general rule be apply to a particular situation in which the feature of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable A sweep generalization be the opposite of a hasty generalization NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC These be know a False Cause fallacy The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something a the cause of an event but it have not actually be show to be the cause For example '' I take an aspirin and prayed to God and my headache disappear So God cure me of the headache '' The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something be assume to be the cause of an event merely because it happen before the event For example '' The Soviet Union collapse after take up atheism Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reason '' CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC This fallacy be similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc It asserts that because two event occur together they must be causally related and leaf no room for other factor that may be the cause s of the event PETITIO PRINCIPII This fallacy occurs when the premise be at least a questionable a the conclusion reach CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO This fallacy occurs when one assumes a a premise the conclusion which one wish to reach Often the proposition will be rephrase so that the fallacy appear to be a valid argument For example '' Homosexuals must not be allow to hold government office Hence any government official who be reveal to be a homosexual will lose his job Therefore homosexual will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail Therefore homosexual can not be allow to hold government office '' Note that the argument be entirely circular the premise be the same a the conclusion An argument like the above have actually be cite a the reason for the British Secret Services official ban on homosexual employee Another example be the classic '' We know that God exists because the Bible tell u so And we know that the Bible be true because it be the word of God '' COMPLEX QUESTION FALLACY OF INTERROGATION This be the Fallacy of Presupposition One example be the classic load question '' Have you stop beating your wife '' The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which have not even be ask This trick be often use by lawyer in cross-examination when they ask question like '' Where do you hide the money you stole '' Similarly politician often ask load question such a '' How long will this EC interference in our affair be allow to continue '' or '' Does the Chancellor plan two more year of ruinous privatization '' IGNORATIO ELENCHI The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claim that an argument support a particular conclusion when it be actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion For example a Christian may begin by say that he will argue that the teaching of Christianity be undoubtably true If he then argues at length that Christianity be of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have show that Christian teaching be true Sadly such fallacious argument be often successful because they arouse emotion which cause others to view the suppose conclusion in a more favourable light EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occurs when a key word be use with two or more different meaning in the same argument For example '' What could be more affordable than free software But to make sure that it remains free that user can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable '' AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occurs when the premise use in an argument be ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing ACCENT Accent be another form of fallacy through shift meaning In this case the meaning be change by alter which part of a statement be emphasize For example consider '' We should not speak ILL of our friend '' and '' We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS '' FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION One fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property share by the part of something must apply to the whole For example '' The bicycle be make entirely of low mass component and be therefore very lightweight '' The other fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property of a number of individual item be share by a collection of those item For example '' A car us less petrol and cause less pollution than a bus Therefore car be less environmentally damage than bus '' FALLACY OF DIVISION The fallacy of division be the opposite of the fallacy of composition Like it opposite it exists in two variety The first be to assume that a property of some thing must apply to it part For example '' You be study at a rich college Therefore you must be rich '' The other be to assume that a property of a collection of item be share by each item For example '' Ants can destroy a tree Therefore this ant can destroy a tree '' THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT This argument state that should one event occur so will other harmful event There be no proof make that the harmful event be cause by the first event For example '' If we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we 'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare Therefore we can not legalize marijuana '' `` A IS BASED ON B '' FALLACIES `` IS A TYPE OF '' FALLACIES These fallacy occur when one attempt to argue that thing be in some way similar without actually specify in what way they be similar Examples '' Is n't history base upon faith If so then be n't the Bible also a form of history '' `` Islam be base on faith Christianity be base on faith so be n't Islam a form of Christianity '' `` Cats be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry dog be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry so be n't dog a form of cat '' AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT This fallacy be an argument of the form `` A implies B B be true therefore A be true '' To understand why it be a fallacy examine the truth table for implication give earlier DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT This fallacy be an argument of the form `` A implies B A be false therefore B be false '' Again the truth table for implication make it clear why this be a fallacy Note that this fallacy be different from Non Causa Pro Causa the latter have the form `` A implies B A be false therefore B be false '' where A do NOT in fact imply B at all Here the problem be not that the implication be invalid rather it be that the falseness of A do not allow u to deduce anything about B CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL This fallacy be an argument of the form `` If A then B therefore if B then A '' ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM This be the fallacy of assert that something be right or good simply because it be old or because `` that 's the way it 's always be '' ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM This be the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it be the fallacy of assert that something be more correct simply because it be new or newer than something else ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM The fallacy of believe that money be a criterion of correctness that those with more money be more likely to be right ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM The fallacy of assume that because someone be poor he or she be sounder or more virtuous than one who be wealthier This fallacy be the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM This be the incorrect belief that an assertion be more likely to be true the more often it be heard An `` argumentum ad nauseum '' be one that employ constant repetition in assert something BIFURCATION Also refer to a the `` black and white '' fallacy bifurcation occurs when one present a situation a have only two alternative where in fact other alternative exist or can exist PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM MANY QUESTIONS This fallacy occurs when a questioner demand a simple answer to a complex question NON SEQUITUR A non-sequitur be an argument where the conclusion be drawn from premise which be not logically connect with it RED HERRING This fallacy be commit when irrelevant material be introduce to the issue be discuss so that everyone 's attention be divert away from the point be make towards a different conclusion REIFICATION HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occurs when an abstract concept be treat a a concrete thing SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF The burden of proof be always on the person make an assertion or proposition Shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium be the fallacy of put the burden of proof on the person who denies or question the assertion be make The source of the fallacy be the assumption that something be true unless proven otherwise STRAW MAN The straw man fallacy be to misrepresent someone else 's position so that it can be attack more easily then to knock down that misrepresent position then to conclude that the original position have be demolish It be a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual argument that have be make THE EXTENDED ANALOGY The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggest general rule be be argue over The fallacy be to assume that mention two different situation in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situation be analogous to each other This fallacy be best explain use a real example from a debate about anti-cryptography legislation '' I believe it be always wrong to oppose the law by break it '' `` Such a position be odious it implies that you would not have support Martin Luther King '' `` Are you say that cryptography legislation be a important a the struggle for Black liberation How dare you '' TU QUOQUE This be the famous `` you too '' fallacy It occurs when an action be argue to be acceptable because the other party have perform it For instance '' You 're just be randomly abusive '' `` So You 've be abusive too ''

Chris Blask writes Add to this the outrageous cost of put someone to death special cell block year of court cost extra guard ... and the benefit of the death penalty entirely disappear That 's because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death override the benefit of all the others Obviously it 's tragic but it be no argument for do away with the death penalty If we go to war and worried about accidentally kill civilian all of the time because our determination of who the enemy really be be imperfect then there be no way to win the war Yes Fortunately we have right-thinking folk like your good self in power and it be therefore deem acceptable to slaughter ten or even hundred of thousand of Iraqis in order to liberate oil^H^H^HKuwait We won the war hurrah hurrah The number of civilian Iraqi death be way over-exaggerated and exploit for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news medium The fact be that less Iraqis die in the Gulf War than do civilian in any other war of comparable size this century This be due mostly to the short duration couple with precise surgical bombing technique which be technically possible only recently The idea that `` hundred of thousand '' of Iraqi citizen die be ludicrous Not even `` hundred of thousand '' of Iraqi soldier die and they be the one be target Or do you think that the US and it ally be specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilian Either the smart bomb do n't hit their target and we know they do or they be target civilian target which be hardly condusive to destroy Iraq 's military potential The military mission planner be not fool they know they have to hit *military* target to win a war Hitting civilian target do nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one want the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator OK so some innocent people die Yes maybe the unarmed civilian flee along that road do n't need to be bombed to bit Perhaps that kid with half his face burn off and the little girl with the mangle leg weren't entirely guilty But it 's worth the death of a few innocent to save the oil^H^H^Hlives of the Kuwaiti people be n't it After all the Iraqis may not have have a chance to vote for Saddam but they show their acceptance of his regime by not assassinate him right All that surrender and flee along open road be just a devious ploy We be entirely within our right to bomb 'em just in case without find out if they be soldier How about all the innocent people who die in blanket-bombing in WW2 I do n't hear you bemoan them War be never an exact science but with smart bomb it 's become more exact with a small percentage of civilian casualty Sometimes mistake be make target be misidentified innocent die That 's war the way it really be But the alternative to allow tyrannical dictator to treat the earth like it 's one big rummage sale grab everything they can get be bad Like Patrick Henry say some 217 year ago `` I know not what course others may take -- but a for me give me liberty or give me death '' War be always the price one must be willing to pay if one wish to stay free The death penalty be conceive a a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigan that have be add automatic appeal lengthy court battle etc have relegate that purpose to a very small part of what it should be Hence the question be do we instate the death penalty a it be meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely Yes let 's reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be All that shit about fair trial and a court of appeal just get in the way of justice Let 's give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save ourselves the expense of all those lawyer Think of the knock-on benefit too LA would never have have to spend so much money cleaning up after riot and hold showcase trial if the cop have be allow to do their job properly A quick bullet through the head of Rodney King and another for the cameraman and everyone would have be save a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense After all if the police decide a man 's guilty that ought to be enough The fact that the death penalty have be show not to have any deterrent effect over imprisonment well that 's entirely irrelevant mathew -- Mathew your sarcasm be note but you be completely off-base here You come off sound like a complete peace-nik idiot although I feel sure that be not your intent So the Iraqi war be wrong eh I 'm sure that appeasement would have work well than war just like it do in WW2 eh I guess we should n't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilian kill in Dresden and Hamburg How about all the poor French who die in the crossfire because we invade the continent We should have just let Hitler take over Europe and you 'd be speak German instead of English right now Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stop His kind do n't understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun My only regret be that Bush wimped out and do n't have the military roll into Baghdad so now Hussein be still in power and the Iraqi people 's sacrifice not to mention the 357 Americans who die be for naught Liberating Kuwait be a good thing but wipe Hussein off the map would 've be well And a for poor poor Rodney King Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of `` not guilty '' Those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no far than the video tape But the jury look at *all* the evidence evidence which you and I have not see When one make a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be present on both side one have simply lower himself to the level of vigilante justice a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policeman Law in this country be intend to protect the right of the accuse whether they be criminal or cop One be not found guilty if there be a reasonable doubt of one 's guilt and only the jury be in a position to ass the evidence and render a verdict Anyone else be simply succumb

Bill Conner bil okcforum.osrhe.edu write There be a couple of thing about your post and others in this thread that be a little confuse An atheist be one for whom all thing can be understood a process of nature exclusively This definition do not include all atheist see the FAQ However I for one do think there be no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanation It make a big difference to claim that all thing can be understood a natural process and to claim that our observation do not require u to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter Humans be not omnipotent and neither be science However science have one advantage theology do n't it be self- correct with nature a it judge It be delightful to see how scientific inquiry be reveal a self- consistent simple picture of our universe Science be no longer a bunch of separate branch it be one From particle physic to psychology And no aspect of our life or our universe be safe from it stern and stony eye Not even our consciousness There be no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything There be no purpose or direction for any event beyond those require by physic chemistry biology etc everything be random nothing be determnined Actually determinism vs. indeterminism be a philosophical question and science can not say whether the whole thing be actually somehow superdeterministic or not I think the question do not have any meaning a far a individual human being go If their apparent free will be an illusion it do not appear to be so from their perspective Bill can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all it product There be nothing require that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it 's just a happy accident Maybe Who be we to tell It seem intelligence be useful when during the history of Earth have _one species_ be able to control one third of the whole biosphere This can still be a result of numerous happy accident our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserve Even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the system that can start replicate will survive those which do n't do n't make it Recommended reading t.o For an atheist no event can be prefer to another or be say to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought -about- an event can have value From whose perspective I value event and thing subjectively from my perspective Nature do not have value because it do not have a perspective value arise from awareness If I have a subjective perspective it be easy to assume that other people also do and if I think about what it would it be like in their position I will eventually discover the Golden Rule Morality be not necessarily a gift from heaven in fact it may be a product of evolution Perhaps we be aware of ourselves because a sense of identity be helpful allows u to play the role of others and make u respect others who seem to have identity too Bill have you ever read Aristotle Try his Ethica Nikomakhea sp for starter How then can an atheist judge value What be the basis for criticize the value ennumerated in the Bible or the purpose impute to God On what ground can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemn It seem that in judging the value that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct be measure but what in nature can serve that purpose What law of nature can you invoke to establish your value C.S Lewis tell u that this argument be the main reason why he abandon his atheism and become Christian The argument be severely flaw Some value such a the Golden Rule can have a rational basis Some others like the basic idea of want to live have probably it root in the way our brain be wire Lewis ignore the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality a well Indeed a human evolve well and well in building and use tool they also become well at kill each other It be a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tool but not against one's own people The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews be not beyond this A simple set of rule to hold the people together under one god Their god do not care much about people of other nation At the time of the NT thing be quite different the Jews be under rule of an _empire_ and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles A new situation require a new morality and along with it a new religion be born A mutation in a meme pool Since every event be entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- do religious or otherwise there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour be to admit that the objection be entirely subjective and that he she just do n't like it that 's it Any value judgement must be preface by the disclaimer that it be nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carry no weight in any `` absolute '' sense It look like you have n't bother to read philosophy Whenever there be an observer there be a subjective point of view which may value it existence and happiness even if that be just a result of some physical event and other 's happiness too if the observer come to think about it In an absolutely objective sense that be without any observer or subject moral judgment lose their meaning It be not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view This include god too their value be only _their_ personal judgment not absolute truth since such truth do not exist The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others be a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by become social being who can think and value others' existence Morality be not property of human alone chimp dolphin and many other specie show great care for each other Dolphins have sometimes save human from drown a good deed indeed That you do n't like what God told people to do say nothing about

That your objection -seem- well found be due to the way you 've be condition there be no `` truth '' content The whole of your intellectual landscape be an illusion a virtual reality The last statement do not logically follow In fact there be every reason to believe our thought can model reality very well and our sens can convey reliable information Solipsism be still a logical possibility but not a very likely one You be continuously mix two different view the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view _which do not exist_ Any observer or thinker any personal be have it own point of view It do not matter whether this point of view be a result of some physical event or not it do not cease to be subjective From a non-observers non-point of view value do not exist Neither do pain or pleasure or beauty or love Such thing be inherently subjective Once again if god want wife to submit to their husband or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or want to punish u if we do n't I disagree with his moral I do not think my moral come from any supreme be to remove my moral mean the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought If god give u morality to judge but I disagree with him it be not my fault He be free to replace my moral I can not see what be the point of give someone a moral system which disagrees with one's own and then to get mad at this God must be schizophrenic All of this be so you have exclude yourself from any discussion of value right wrong goood evil etc and can not participate Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever Neither can the opinion of any god for that matter I can not understand why a subjective opinion of a thing make of matter be in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing make of something else Bill take note Absolute value must be independent of _any_ be _including_ god If god have a subjective viewpoint it be his own point of view and his moral be his own Petri

This kind of argument cry for a comment ... jbrown batman.bmd.trw.com write In article 1993Apr3.095220.24632 leland.Stanford.EDU galahad leland.Stanford.EDU Scott Compton writes Jim you originally write ... God do not create disease nor be He responsible for the malady of newborn What God do create be life accord to a protein code which be mutable and can evolve Without delve into a deep discussion of creationism v evolutionism God create the original genetic code perfect and without flaw ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~ Do you have any evidence for this If the code be once perfect and have degrade ever since we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement should n't we Perhaps the big `` imperfection '' of the code be that it be full of non-coding region intron which be so call because they intervene with the cod region exon An impressive amount of evidence suggests that intron be of very ancient origin it be likely that early exon represent early protein domain Is the number of intron decrease or increase It appear that intron loss can occur and specie with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their gene On the other hand the possibility that intron have be insert later present several logical difficulty Introns be remove by a splice mechanism this would have to be present but unused if intron be insert Moreover intron insertion would have require _precise_ target random insertion would not be tolerate since sequence for intron removal self-splicing of mRNA be conserve Besides transposition of a sequence usually leaf a trace long terminal repeat and target site duplication and these be not found in or near intron sequence I seriously recommend reading textbook on molecular biology and genetics before post `` theological argument '' like this Try Watson 's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell Lodish Baltimore 's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starter Remember the question be pose in a theological context Why do God cause disease in newborn and my answer be likewise from a theological perspective -- my own It be no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different Scientific perspective be support by the evidence whereas theological perspective often fail to fulfil this criterion I think you misread my meaning I say God make the genetic code perfect but that do n't mean it 's perfect now It have certainly evolve since For the bad Would you please cite a few reference that support your assertion Your assertion be less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence In fact it have be claimed that parasite and disease be perhaps more important than we 've thought for instance sex might have evolve a defence against parasite This view be support by computer simulation of evolution eg Tierra Perhaps I thought it be high energy ray like X-rays gamma ray and cosmic ray that cause most of the damage In fact it be thermal energy that do most of the damage although it be usually mild and easily fix by enzymatic action Actually neither of u `` know '' what the atmosphere be like at the time when God create life According to my recollection most biologist do not claim that life begin 4 billion year ago -- after all that would only be a half billion year or so after the earth be create It would still be too primitive to support life I seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion year ago for the origination of life on earth Anyone with a well estimate I 'd replace `` create '' with `` form '' since there be no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be form without one Most recent estimate of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 4.8 billion year and early sign of life not true fossil but organic stromatolite-like layer date back to 3.5 billion year This would leave more than billion year for the first cell to evolve I 'm sorry I ca n't give any reference this be base on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attend here dominion it be no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer disease both bacterial/viral and genetic Although the force of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this Again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence for this suppose `` degeneration '' I can understand Scott 's reaction Excuse me but this be so far-fetched that I know you must be jesting Do you know what pathogen be Do you know what Point Mutations be Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY In response to your last statement no and neither do you You may very well believe that and accept it a fact but you can not *know* that I hope you do n't forget this We have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously Do you have evidence against this conclusion In science one do not have to _believe_ in anything It be a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve But the right path to walk be to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one 's own conclusion prior to this Theology do not use this method Therefore I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusion Human DNA be more `` complex '' tends to accumulate error adversely affect our well-being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler DNA of bacteria and virus tend to become more efficient in cause infection and disease It be a bad combination Hence we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases/disorders You be suppose a purpose not a valid move Bacteria and virus do not exist to cause disease They be just another manifest of a general principle of evolution only replication save replicators from degradiation We be just an efficient method for our DNA to survive and replicate The less efficient method do n't make it to the present And for the last time Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA be degrade through evolutionary process Some people have claimed that the opposite be true we have suppress our selection and thus be bound to degrade I have n't see much evidence for either claim But then I ask So Where be this relevant to my discussion in answer John 's question of why Why be there genetic disease and why be there so many bacterial and viral disease which require baby to develop antibody Is it God 's fault the original question -- I say no it be not Of course nothing `` evil '' be god 's fault But your explanation do not work it fails miserably You may be right But the fact be that you do n't know that Satan be not responsible and neither do I. Suppose that a powerful evil be like Satan exists Would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ill that affect mankind I do n't think so He could have do a much well Job Pun intend The problem be it seem no Satan be necessary to explain any disease they be just a inevitable a any product of evolution Did I say that Where Seems to me like another bad inference Actually what you 've do be to oversimplify what I say to the point that your summary of my word take on a new context I never say that people be `` meant '' presumably by God `` to be punish by get disease '' Why I do say be that free moral choice have attendent consequence If mankind chooses to reject God a people have do since the begin then they should not expect God to protect them from adverse event in an entropic universe I be not expect this If god exists I expect him to leave u alone I would also like to hear why do you believe your choice be indeed free This be an interest philosophical question and the answer be not a clear-cut a it seem to be What consequence would you expect from reject Allah Oh I admit it 's not perfect yet But I 'm work on it A good library or a bookstore be a good start point What do this have to do with the price of tea in China or the question to which I provide an answer Biology and Genetics be fine subject and important scientific endeavor But they explain *how* God create and set up life process They do n't explain the why behind creation life or it subsequent evolution Why be there a `` why behind '' And your proposition be something that be not support by the evidence This be why we recommend these book Is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover Evidence for this If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention a recent cosmological theory Hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this Thanks Scotty for your fine and sagely advice But I be not highly motivate to learn all the nitty-gritty detail of biology and genetics although I 'm sure I 'd find it a fascinate subject For I realize that the detail do not change the Big Picture that God create life in the begin with the ability to change and adapt to it environment I 'm sorry but they do There be no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that be capable of adaptation It can come into existence without a Supreme Being Try reading P.W Atkins Creation Revisited Freeman 1992 Petri

Again this come from a certain question see above Well ideally they do n't but if they must they should do it by consensus IMO 3 How do we keep from a `` whatever be legal be what be `` moral '' `` position By adopt a default position that people 's moral decision be none of society 's business So how can we put people in jail How can we condemn other society Because sometimes that 's necessary The hard trick be to recognise when it be and equally importantly when it be n't and only interfere when it 's truly necessary Why would it be necessary What right do we have to interfere IMO it be n't often that interference i.e jail and force of various kind and degree be both necessary and effective Where you derive the right to interfere be a difficult question it 's a sort of liar 's paradox `` force be necessary for freedom '' One possible justification be that people who wish to take away freedom should n't object if their own freedom be take away the paradox do n't arise if we do n't actively wish to take way anyone 's freedom The introduction of permissible interference cause the problem that it can be either too much or too little but most people seem to agree that some level of interference be necessary They see the need for a `` justice '' system How can we even define that term Only by consensus I guess Thus you get a situation where `` The law often allows what honour forbids '' which I've come to believe be a it should be I admit I do n't understand that statement What I mean be that while thus-and-such may be legal thus-and-such may also be see a immoral The law let you do it but you do n't let yourself do it Eating meat for example
In 1993Apr4.093904.20517 proxima.alt.za lucio proxima.alt.za Lucio de Re writes darice yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au Fred Rice writes My point of view be that the argument `` all sexism be bad '' just simply do not hold Let me give you an example How about permit a woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy -- should that be allow It happens to be sexist a it give a particular right only to woman Nevertheless despite the fact that it be sexist I completely support such a law because I think it be just Fred you 're exasperate ... Sexism like racialism be a form of discrimination use obvious physical or cultural difference to deny one portion of the population the same right a another In this context your example above hold no water whatsoever there 's no discrimination in `` deny '' men maternity leave in fact I 'm quite convince that be anyone to experiment with male pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take leave on medical ground Okay ... I argue this thoroughly about 3-4 week ago Men and woman be different ... physically physiologically and psychologically Much recent evidence for this statement be present in the book `` Brainsex '' by Anne Moir and David Jessel I recommend you find a copy and read it Their book be an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and be well reference Now if woman and men be different in some way the law can only adequately take into account their need in these area where they be different by also take into account the way in which men and woman be different Maternity leave be an example of this -- it take into account that woman get pregnant It do not give woman the same rule it would give to men because to treat woman like it treat men in this instance would be unjust This be just simply an obvious example of where men and woman be intrinsically different Now people make the _naive_ argument that sexism oppression However maternity leave be sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT Men do not have the same access to leave that woman do not to the same extent or degree and therefore IT IS SEXIST No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave HE NEVER CAN And therefore the law IS SEXIST No man can have access to maternity leave NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT I hope this be clear Maternity leave be an example where a sexist law be just because the sexism here just reflect the `` sexism '' of nature in make men and woman different There be many other difference between men and woman which be far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book `` Brainsex '' Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant be fallacious If men can one day become pregnant it will be by have biologically become woman To have a womb and the other factor require for pregnancy be usually wrap up in the definition of what a woman be -- so your argument when it be examine be see to be fallacious You be say that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that woman can have if they also become woman -- which actually just support my statement that maternity leave be sexist The discrimination come in when a woman be deny opportunity because of her legally determine sexual inferiority As I understand most religious sexual discrimination and I doubt that Islam be exceptional the female be not allow into the priestly caste and in general be subjugate so that she have no aspiration to right which a an equal human she ought to be entitle to There be no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function be take by Islamic scholar There be female Islamic scholar and female Islamic scholar have always exist in Islam An example from early Islamic history be the Prophet 's widow Aisha who be recognize in her time and be recognize in our time a an Islamic scholar No matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religion seem historically to have serve the function of oppress the female whether by force her to procreate to the extent where there be no opportunity for self-improvement or by deny her access to the same facility the male be offer You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religion and I dispute it I could go on and on about woman in Islam etc. but I recently reposted something here under the head `` Islam and Women '' -- if it be still at your news-site I suggest you read it It be reposted from soc.religion.islam so if it have disappear from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam I forgot what it original title be though I will email it to you if you like The Roman Catholic Church be the most blatant of the culprit because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the other religious be no different let a woman attempt to escape her role a child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her Your statement that `` other religion be no different '' be I think a statement base simply on lack of knowledge about religion other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism I 'll accept your affirmation that Islam grant woman the same right a men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the same position a say Khomeini and there be no artificial religious or social obstacle on her path to achieve this Aisha who I mention earlier be not only an Islamic scholar but also be at one stage a military leader Show me the equivalent of Hillary Rhodam-Clinton within Islam and I may consider discuss the issue with you The Prophet 's first wife who die just before the `` Hijra '' the Prophet 's journey from Mecca to Medina be a successful businesswoman Lucio you can not make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint be base on ignorance about world religion

In article 1993Apr15.212943.15118 bnr.ca Rashid writes deletion The fatwa be level at the person of Rushdie any action of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of it own but by the will of the author and the publisher The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his action a well The crime be certainly a crime in progress at many level and be be played out and played up in the the full view of the medium P.S I 'm not sure about this but I think the charge of `` shatim '' also applies to Rushdie and may be encompass under the umbrella of the `` fasad '' ruling If this be ground firmly in Islam a you claim then you have just expose Islam a the ground for terrorism plain and simple Whether you like it or not whether Rushdie act like a total jerk or not there be no acceptable civilize basis for put someone in fear of their life for word It simply do not matter whether his underlie motive be to find the bad possible way he could to insult Muslims and their belief get that You do not threaten the life of someone for word when you do you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position If you support threaten the life of someone for word you be not yet civilize This be exactly where I and many of the people I know have to depart from respect the religion of others When those belief allow and encourage by interpretation the kill of non-physical opposition You or I or anyone be more than privledged to believe that someone whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover be beyond the pale of civilize society and you can condemn his/her soul refuse to allow any member of your association to interact with him/her _peacably_ demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the `` miscreant '' or whatever short of physical force But once you physically threaten or support physical threat you get much closer to your earlier comparison of rape with YOU a the rapist who whine `` She ask for it look how she be dress '' Blaming the victim when you be unable to be civilize do n't fly Dew
On Fri 16 Apr 1993 02:51:29 GMT healta saturn.wwc.edu Tammy R Healy say TRH I hope you 're not go to flame him Please give him the same coutesy you' TRH ve give me But you have be courteous and therefore receive courtesy in return This person instead have post one of the bad argument I have ever see make from the pro-Christian people I 've know several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he present such an argument to them Let 's ignore the fact that it 's not a true trilemma for the moment nice word Maddi original or be it a real word and concentrate on the liar lunatic part The argument claim that no one would follow a liar let alone thousand of people Look at L. Ron Hubbard Now he be probably not all there but I think he be mostly a liar and a con-artist But look at how many thousand of people follow Dianetics and Scientology I think the Baker 's and Swaggert along with several other televangelist lie all the time but look at the number of follower they have As for lunatic the best example be Hitler He be obviously insane his advisor certainly thought so Yet he have a whole country entralled and come close to ruling all of Europe How many Germans give their life for him To this day he have his follower I 'm just amaze that people still try to use this argument It 's just so obviously *wrong*
C.Wainwright eczcaw mips.nott.ac.uk write I Jim I always thought that homophobe be only a word use at Act UP rally I do n't beleive real people use it Let 's see if we agree on the term 's definition A homophobe be one who actively and militantly attack homosexual because he be actually a latent homosexual who us his hostility to conceal his true orientation Since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality be a homophobe your implication be clear it must necessarily follow that all men be latent homosexual or bisexual at the very least Crap crap crap crap crap A definition of any type of 'phobe come from phobia an irrational fear of Hence a homophobe not only in ACT UP meeting the word be apparently in general use now Or perhaps it be n't in the bible Wouldst thou prefer if I be to communicate with thou in bilespeak Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of be a spider Does an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of be a wide open space Do you understand English Obviously someone who have phobia will react to it They will do their best to avoid it and if that be not possible they will either strike out or run away Or do gaybashings occur because of natural process People who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence Is n't that what I say ... What be you take issue with here your remark be merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful ... It would seem odd if homosexuality have any evolutionary function other than limit population growth since evolution only occurs when the member of one generation pas along their trait to subsequent generation Homosexuality be an evolutionary deadend If I take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all men be really homosexual and evolution of our specie at least be go nowhere So *every* time a man have sex with a woman they intend to produce child Hmm ... no wonder the world be overpopulate Obviously you keep to the Monty Python song `` Every sperm be sacred '' And if a *you* say it have a purpose a a mean to limit population growth then it be by your own arguement natural Consider the context I 'm talk about an evolutionary function One of the most basic requirement of evolution be that member of a specie procreate those who do n't have no purpose in that context Another point be that if the offspring of each generation be to survive the participation of both parent be necessary a family must exist since homosexual do not reproduce they can not constitute a family Since the majority of humankind be part of a family homosexuality be an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will Well if that be true by your own arguements homosexual would have vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation Also the parent from single parent family should put the baby out in the cold now co they must by your arguement die By your argument homosexuality be genetically determine As to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context mean I be talk about evolution the preservation of the specie the fundamental premise of the whole process But it get bad Since the overwhelm majority of people actually -prefer- a heterosexual relationship homosexuality be a social abberation a well The homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family But wait there's more Read the above I expect you to have at least ten child by now with the family grow These day sex be less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no-one but more to do with pleasure In pre-pill and pre-condom day if you have sex there be the chance of produce child These day be just ai n't true People can decide whether or not to have child and when Soon they will be able to choose it 's sex c but that 's another arguement ... so it 's more of a `` lifestyle '' decision Again by your arguement since homosexual can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not child Both be a `` unnatural '' a each other Yet another non-sequitur Sex be an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it be also recreation be incidental That homosexual do n't procreate mean that sex be -only- recreation and nothing more they serve no -evolutionary- purpose Since homosexual have come out the closet and have convince some policy maker that they have civil right they be now claim that their sexuality be a preference a life-style an orientation a choice that should be protect by law Now if homosexuality be a mere choice and if it be both contrary to nature and anti-social then it be a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they become prominent People be people be people Who be you to tell anyone else how to live their life Are you god tm If so fancy a date Here 's pretty obvious dodge do you really think you 've say anything or do you just feel obligate to respond to every statement I be not tell anyone anything I be demonstrate that there be argument against the practice of homosexuality provide it 's a merely an alternate lifestlye that be not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand I realize of course that this come dangerously close to establish a value and that atheist be compel to object on that basis but if you be to be consistent you have no case in this regard To characterize any opposition to homosexuality a homophobic be to ignore some very compelling argument against the legitimization of the homosexual `` life-style '' But since the charge be only intend to intimidate it 's really just demogoguery and not to be take seriously Fact be Jim there be far more persuasive argument for suppress homosexuality than those give but consider this a start Again crap All your argument be base on outdated ideal Likewise the bible Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generation spawn by a `` bastard '' to eternal damnation Or someone who crush his penis either accidently or not.. Both be in Deuteronomy I 'm sure your comment pertains to something but you 've disguise it so well I ca n't see what Where do I mention ideal out-dated or otherwise Your argument be very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute As to why homosexual should be exclude from participation in scout the reason be the same a those use to restrict them from teach by their own logic homosexual be deviate social and biological Since any adult be a role model for a child it be incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child harm In this case harm mean primarily social though that could be extend easily enough You show me *anyone* who have sex in a way that everyone would describe a normal and will take of my hat Puma baseball cap to you `` One man 's meat be another man 's poison '' What have this get to do with anything Would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain your objection I would really like to believe that you can discus this issue intelligibly
livesey solntze.wpd.sgi.com Jon Livesey writes How long do it the motto have to stay around before it becomes the default ... Where 's the cutoff point I do n't know where the exact cutoff be but it be at least after a few year and surely after 40 year Why do the notion of default not take into account change in population makeup Specifically which change be you talk about Are you argue that the motto be interpret a offensive by a large portion of the population now than 40 year ago

mmwang adobe.com Michael Wang writes Well I have typed in the OED definition As you will note upon reading them a punishment be an inanimate object be incapable of `` show mercy '' So you can not say that a merciless punishment be a cruel one Sorry you must have miss the stuff in parens when you read the definition where transf transfer sense and fig figurative -ly `` Things '' can be cruel Samples of text from the first definition include `` Because I would not see thy cruell nailes Plucke out his poore old eye '' and `` The puniness of man in the centre of a cruel and frown universe '' Sure nail can be cruel I 'd imagine nail in your eye would be *very* painful But this do not imply that a painless death be cruel which be what you be suppose to be try to show
